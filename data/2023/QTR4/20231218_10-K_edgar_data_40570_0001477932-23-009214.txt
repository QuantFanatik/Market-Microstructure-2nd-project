We, through our operating subsidiaries, deliver our services from a network of four virtual locations and 26 branch office locations located in or near several major U.S. cities, including, but not limited to: Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, and Miami. The Company has several subsidiary corporations all of which are wholly owned and consolidated under GEE Group Inc. Our material operating subsidiaries include Access Data Consulting Corporation, Agile Resources, Inc., BMCH, Inc., Paladin Consulting, Inc., Scribe Solutions, Inc., SNI Companies, Inc., Triad Logistics, Inc., and Triad Personnel Services, Inc. In addition, we and our operating subsidiaries own and operate under other trade names, including Accounting Now, Ashley Ellis, Staffing Now , SNI Banking, SNI Certes , SNI Energy , SNI Financial , SNI Technology , GEE Group (Columbus), General Employment, Omni One and Triad Staffing. Services Provided We provide our services to a broad range of customers from small and medium-sized businesses to the Fortune 1000. Our services include the provision of highly specialized contract or permanently placed professionals in several verticals, including IT, engineering, accounting and finance, office support, and specialized contract healthcare professionals, including scribes who specialize in electronic medical record EMR services for emergency departments, specialty physician practices and clinics. We also provide temporary staffing services in the light industrial (blue collar) areas. Our contract and placement services are principally provided under two operating divisions or segments: Professional Staffing Services and Industrial Staffing Services. Our operating subsidiaries and end markets served under each of its operating divisions are as follows: 3 Table of Contents Professional Division Access Data Consulting provides hard-to-find IT talent to customers on a direct hire or contract basis and human resources consulting services and solutions in the higher-end IT vertical including project management support to businesses regionally (Western and Southwestern U.S.) and, to a lesser extent, throughout the rest of the U.S. Agile Resources delivers unique CIO advisory services, IT project support and human resources solutions regionally (Southeastern U.S.) and, to a lesser extent, nationally in the areas of application architecture and delivery, enterprise operations, digital, information lifecycle management and project management all with flexible delivery options including contract staffing and direct hire.

Industrial Division Triad Staffing provides light industrial contract labor services for all phases of manufacturing and electronic assembly, warehousing, picking, packing and shipping and custodial and general labor operations throughout Ohio . The percentage of revenues derived from each of the Company s direct hire and contract services lines are as follows: Fiscal 2023 2022 Professional direct hire placement services 12.7 16.1 Professional contract services 78.7 74.2 Industrial contract services 8.6 9.7 4 Table of Contents Business Strategy Our business strategy is multi-dimensional and encompasses both organic growth and growth through strategic acquisitions. Since 2015, the Company has completed four acquisitions, the most recent of which was SNI, which to date has been its largest. The main tenants of our strategy are to grow organically by: Providing innovative solutions for clients delivered through an enhanced and expanded menu of professional services offerings while increasing the penetration of clients in our existing markets for our IT, finance and accounting, healthcare, engineering and office support verticals; Entering other fast-growing markets following existing customers who are expanding their operations and cross-selling services by leveraging strategic customer relationships capitalizing on the Company s national managed services agreements MSA, MSP and VMS relationships; Expanding our geographic footprint of professional services offerings into new markets believed to possess high growth potential, particularly with regard to our IT brands; Adding recruiting and sales talent to our existing delivery network to obtain new customers and increase the number of placements made to increase revenue; Increasing scalability and expanding operating margins through the on-going process of streamlining back office operations, establishing and leveraging regional centers of excellence, improving upon per desk production averages, elimination of duplicative costs among our businesses, and continued realization of economies of scale; and Capitalizing on hiring opportunities created by volatility in the economic and labor markets by providing on-demand labor to fill the personnel voids of businesses following corporate America s reactions and resulting on-going realignments since the on-set of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the economy recovers and companies have returned to sustained operations and growth, demand for our services has accelerated, with a particular focus on IT, E-Commerce and Logistics. We expect to continue to capitalize on these opportunities and to explore and innovate others, particularly in IT, including frontier areas such as digital content and information management disciplines. Growth Through Strategic Acquisitions: Since 2015, a significant portion of our growth has been achieved through acquisitions of complementary businesses. We intend to continue to expand our business through strategic acquisitions, subject to our business plans and management s ability to identify, acquire and develop suitable acquisition or investment targets in both new and existing service categories. Along with our significant business growth to date, we have built a robust platform with the appropriate infrastructure and scalability, which we believe is necessary to assimilate acquisitions. We continue to explore opportunities for potential acquisitions in the fragmented staffing industry. Our acquisition strategy includes, but is not limited to, targeting companies or transactions that we believe may have one or more of the following characteristics: A focus on IT specialties and other verticals, including cyber security, government and targets in the professional services sectors; A well-managed business with experienced operators and with high gross profit and EBITDA margins, as well as consistent revenue growth; Limited enterprise risk and successful due diligence; and Pricing commensurate with profitability and growth, must be accretive to earnings and consideration generally consisting of a combination of cash, seller and/or bank financing and stock. 5 Table of Contents Marketing We market our staffing services using our corporate and trade names in our respective vertical markets. As of September 30, 2023, we operated from locations in eleven (11) states, including twenty-six (26) branch offices in downtown or suburban areas of major U.S. cities and four (4) additional U.S. locations utilizing local staff members working remotely. We have offices or serve markets remotely, as follows; (i) one office in each of Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota, and New Jersey, and one remote local market presence in Virginia; (ii) two offices each in Georgia and Massachusetts; (iii) three offices in Colorado; (iv) two offices and two additional local market presences in Texas; (v) six offices and one additional local market presence in Florida; and (vi) seven offices in Ohio. We market our staffing services to prospective clients primarily through the use of the internet, specialty brands and corporate websites, digital direct mail campaigns, publishing annual electronic and widely distributed salary guides, advertising in tech, HR and accounting publications, attendance and booth displays at specialty trade shows, participation and membership in chambers of commerce and other business organizations, and support for our employees philanthropic activities. Our sales consultants and business development managers also engage in telephone marketing using our CRM tools to identify prospects, and through the mailing of tailored employment bulletins which list highly-skilled candidates available for placement and contract employees available for assignment. There was no customer that represented more than 10 of the Company s consolidated revenue in fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. Competition The staffing industry is highly fragmented with a multitude of competitors. There are relatively few barriers to entry by firms offering direct hire placement and staff augmentation services although significant amounts of working capital typically are required to fund the payroll of temporary workers for businesses providing contract staffing services. New entrants to the staffing industry are constantly introduced to the marketplace. Our competitors include sole-proprietorship operations, local and regional firms as well as national organizations. In the U.S., large national firms have annual revenue of approximately 100 million and up to 10 billion. Local and regional firms yearly revenue can range from one to several million dollars or more. The largest portion of the marketplace consists of small, individual-sized or family-run operations. With low barriers to entry, sole proprietorships and smaller entities routinely enter the staffing industry. Many competitors are larger corporations with substantially greater resources than ours; however, as described below, we believe we are able to compete successfully in the verticals and end markets in which we operate. Our professional and industrial staffing services compete effectively by providing highly qualified candidates who are well matched for the position, by developing and maintaining outstanding client relationships on a local level, by responding quickly to client requests, and by establishing offices and presences in convenient locations. As part of our services, we provide professional reference checking, scrutiny of candidates work experience and optional custom background checks. In general, we believe that a positive client experience is most important, and pricing often is secondary to quality of service as a competitive factor. During slow hiring periods, competition can put pressure on our pricing; however, we believe we are able to effectively compete on price in such situations. 6 Table of Contents Our Competitive Strengths We believe that we are able to compete effectively in the staffing industry because we have: Deep experience and vertical specialization and expertise in niche markets; Invested in robust sales programs and marketing tools and technology and CRM software to successfully target and reach out to potential new customers; Long-tenured division leaders, business development managers and vertical specialists (e.g., certified public accountants for accounting, tax and financial placements) with deep and relevant staffing industry experience; Strong and proven capability to deliver outstanding results for our clients under significant time constraints on large-scale projects leveraging our wide office network and experienced project team leaders, including experience with MSP and VMS programs; Well established strategies and procedures for both temporary and permanent virtual working supported by technology to facilitate communication, recruiting, onboarding and management of the business virtually; Specialized state-of-the-art databases, applicant tracking systems ATS and other technology tools that facilitate swift, expert matching of candidates to job requirements providing highly-qualified multiple choices to clients; Localized decision-making and a lack of a multi-layered bureaucracy which provides for more rapid responses to customized client requests and a streamlined approval process in place for speedy recruitment of personnel; and Hands-on training with specialized modules for newly hired recruiters and account management personnel. Recruiting The success of our services is highly dependent on our ability to recruit and retain qualified candidates. Prospective employment candidates are generally recruited through job postings and contact made electronically using various internet tools as well as telephone contact by our employment consultants. For internet postings, we maintain our corporate web page at www.geegroup.com and our specialty brand web pages in addition to extensive use of internet job posting bulletin board services. We also maintain database records of applicants skills through our ATS to assist in matching applicant skills with job openings and contract assignments. We generally screen, interview and, in many cases background check, all applicants who are presented to our clients. Industry Overview The staffing industry is divided into three major segments: temporary staffing services, professional employer organizations PEOs and placement agencies. Temporary staffing services provide workers for limited periods, often to substitute for absent permanent workers or to help during periods of peak demand. These workers, who are often employees of the temporary staffing agency, will generally fill clerical, technical, or industrial positions. PEOs, sometimes referred to as employee leasing agencies, contract to provide workers to customers for specific functions, often related to human resource management. In many cases, a customer s employees are hired by a PEO and then contracted back to the customer. Placement agencies, sometimes referred to as executive recruiters or headhunters, find workers to fill permanent positions at customer companies. These agencies may specialize in placing senior managers, mid-level managers, technical workers, or clerical and other support workers. 7 Table of Contents Our business is mainly that of a temporary staffing company within the broader staffing industry, however, we also offer and provide permanent placement services in our Professional Staffing Services segment. We employ the substantial portion of our staff members we place on temporary assignments with our clients. In addition to assisting our clients in managing peaks and valleys in their staffing needs, the temporary workers we place come in the form of a broader human resources management solution. That is, our clients do not bear the usual employment risks and compliance burdens associated with our temporary workers; instead, we retain these costs and risks as the employer of record. We believe this is a significant value add for our temporary staffing clients. Staffing companies identify potential candidates through online advertising and referrals, and interview, test and counsel workers before sending them to the customer for approval. Pre-employment screening can include skills assessment and reference checking, as well as drug tests and criminal background checks. The personnel staffing industry has been radically changed by the internet. Many employers list available positions with one or several internet personnel sites, such as those offered by firms like Monster or CareerBuilder, and on their own websites. Personnel agencies operate their own sites and often still work as intermediaries by helping employers accurately describe job openings and by screening candidates who submit applications. Major end-use customers include businesses from virtually all industries. Marketing involves direct sales presentations, referrals from existing clients and advertising. Agencies compete both for customers and workers. Depending on market supply and demand at any given time, agencies may allocate more resources either to finding potential employers or potential workers. Permanent placement agencies work either on a retained or on a contingency basis. Clients may retain an agency for a specific job search or on contract for a specific period. Temporary staffing services charge customers a fixed price per hour or a standard markup on prevailing hourly rates. For many staffing companies, including ours, demand is lower late in the fourth calendar quarter and early in the first calendar quarter, partly because of holidays, and is higher during the rest of the year. Staffing companies may have high receivables from customers. Temporary staffing agencies and PEOs must manage a high cash flow because they make payroll payments to their employees on behalf of client employers. Cash flow imbalances also occur because agencies must pay workers even if they have not been paid by clients. The revenue of staffing companies depends on the number of jobs they fill, which in turn can depend upon the economic environment. During economic slowdowns, many client companies may slow down or stop hiring altogether. During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many client companies closed their businesses and stopped hiring or contracting employees. Internet employment sites expand a Company s ability to find workers without the help of traditional agencies. Staffing companies often work as intermediaries, helping employers accurately describe job openings and screen candidates. Increasing the use of sophisticated, automated job description and candidate screening tools could make many traditional functions of personnel agencies obsolete. Free social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook are also becoming a common way for recruiters and employees to connect without the assistance of a staffing agency. To avoid large placement agency fees, big companies may use in-house personnel staff, current employee referrals, or human resources consulting companies to find and hire new personnel. Because placement agencies typically charge a fee based on a percentage of the first year s salary of a new worker, companies with many jobs to fill have a financial incentive to avoid use of agencies. Many staffing companies are small and may depend heavily on a big customer for a large portion of revenue. Large customer concentration may lead to increased revenue, but also expose agencies to higher risks. When major accounts experience financial hardships, and have less need for temporary employment services, agencies stand to lose large portions of revenue. The loss of a staff member who handles a large volume of business may result in a large loss of revenue for a staffing company. Individual staff members, rather than the staffing company itself, often develop strong relationships with customers. Non-compete agreements are commonly used by staffing companies, however, staff members who move to another staffing company are often able to work around terms and conditions of their non-compete agreements and move customers with them. 8 Table of Contents Some of the best opportunities for temporary employment are in industries traditionally active in seasonal cycles, such as manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail. However, seasonal demand for workers also creates cash flow fluctuations throughout the year. Staffing companies are subject to regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and often by state authorities. Many federal anti-discrimination rules regulate the type of information that employment firms can request from candidates or provide to customers about candidates. In addition, the relationship between the agency and its temporary employees, or its employee candidates may not always be clear, resulting in legal and regulatory uncertainty. Trends in the Staffing Business Start-up costs for a staffing company can be relatively low. Individual offices can be profitable and consolidation is driven by opportunities for large or growing agencies to develop national relationships with big customers or build resources and scale for future growth. Some agencies expand by starting new offices in promising markets, others prefer to buy existing independent offices with proven staff and an existing customer roster, while still others focus on both. At some companies, temporary workers have become such a large part of the workforce that staffing company employees sometimes work at the customer s site to recruit, train, and manage temporary employees. Staffing companies try to match the best qualified employees for the customer s needs, but often provide additional training specific to that company, such as instruction in the use of proprietary software. Some personnel consulting firms and human resource departments use psychological tests to evaluate potential job candidates. In addition to more comprehensive background checks, headhunters often check the credit history of prospective employees. We believe the trends of outsourcing entire departments and dependence on temporary and leased workers will continue to expand creating opportunities for staffing companies. Taking advantage of their in-house expertise in assessing worker capabilities, some staffing companies manage their clients entire human resource functions. Human resources outsourcing HRO may include management of personnel and payroll administration, tax filings, and benefit administration services. HRO may also include recruitment process outsourcing RPO ), whereby an agency manages all recruitment activities for a client. New online technology is improving staffing efficiency. For example, some online applications coordinate workflow for staffing agencies, their clients and temporary workers, and allow agencies and customers to share work order requests, submit and track candidates, approve timesheets and expenses, and run reports. Interaction between candidates and potential employers is increasingly being handled online. Initially viewed as rivals, some Internet job-search companies and traditional employment agencies are now collaborating. While some Internet sites do not allow agencies to use their services to post jobs or look through resumes, others find that agencies are their biggest customers, earning the sites a large percentage of their revenue. Some staffing companies contract to help client employers find workers online. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused staffing companies to significantly rethink and alter their operations and, in some cases, even their fundamental business models. Staffing companies played a prominent, if not leading, role in recent new workplace trends, including flexible scheduling and remote work arrangements, as two significant examples. A natural result of the shutdowns, quarantines, social distancing and other COVID-19 guidelines is reinforcement of these types of newer workplace trends in many cases. Therefore, we expect that even as the threat of COVID-19 has substantially lessened, these workplace trends are likely to continue on and occupy a permanent place going forward. 9 Table of Contents Most recently, the staffing industry overall has experienced a material decline in business during 2023, following record or near record performance in 2022. Staffing Industry Analysts SIA ), a leading industry trade organization, recently published in its September 2023 Industry Forecast update, that the U.S. Staffing Industry is expected to decline by 10 in 2023. The SIA report cites forecasted declines in virtually all professional and industrial or commercial verticals. The identified causes vary within different verticals and scenarios, with the overall level of uncertainties that persist in the U.S. and global economies and labor markets receiving significant mention. Other cited causes of the decline particularly in light industrial and administrative and clerical markets are the rise of new B2C trends, such as Uber and DoorDash, and, in other markets, side gigs that offer potential candidates alternative opportunities and increased competition for recruiters. Employees As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 251 regular employees and the number of contract service employees varied week to week during fiscal 2023, from a minimum of approximately 1,530 to a maximum of 1,996.

THE U.S. ECONOMY CURRENTLY IS BEING NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT INFLATION, A LOOMING RESCESSION, AND DISRUPTIONS IN SUPPLY AND THE WORKFORCE; RECENT GLOBAL SOCIOECONOMIC TRENDS, INCLUDING THE WAR IN UKRAINE AND U.S. RELATIONS WITH CERTAIN FOREIGN POWERS MAY HAVE A FURTHER ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE U.S. ECONOMY AND OUR BUSINESS. The U.S. and larger global economies experienced historically high inflation during 2022, which continued into 2023. The Federal Reserve and other Central Banks already have raised interest rates more aggressively and to their highest levels in decades. As a result, the prospect for a recession is considered by many to be likely. Some sources have declared that the U.S. already has experienced a recession. Consumer prices, including basic costs of food, fuel, utilities, healthcare, mortgage and personal loan rates, and other non-discretionary and discretionary consumer items have risen significantly. Wages are up, however, increases in wages have lagged price inflation resulting in a net decline in real personal incomes relative to consumer spending. Volatility continues to exist in the workforce making it more difficult and costly for employers to recruit, hire and/or retain workers. U.S. unemployment remains relatively low, however the labor utilization rate and ratio of workers to the total population also remain low. Shortages in the workforce are a significant factor in supply shortages relative to demand and also help fuel inflation. On the global stage, two wars are now being waged, the first led by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the second, following the recent invasion of Israel by Hamas terrorists. These and overtures by China over Taiwan and the South China Sea, also add instability to the uncertainty driving socioeconomic forces, which in turn, impact the Company s and its subsidiaries operations. The present conditions and state of our U.S. and global economies make it difficult to predict the extent to which a recession has occurred or will occur or worsen in the near future, and we and other members of the U.S. Staffing Industry already have seen significant declines in business in 2023. In the event of recurring or worsening conditions, in which the U.S. economy remains uncertain or contracts, we expect that our business will continue to be negatively impacted, accordingly. The Company has taken significant actions to shore up its resources and means in order to mitigate the negative effects of economic downturns; however, should economic conditions remain uncertain or worsen in the future, one may expect either scenario to continue to have an adverse effect on the business of the Company and its subsidiaries. THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC AND ITS SUBSEQUENT VARIANTS, CARES ACT REQUIREMENTS, AND TRENDS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. Recent global socioeconomic conditions, including the negative effects of the Coronavirus Pandemic COVID-19 ), and disruption of financial markets, severely affected our business and results of operations during fiscal 2020 and, although to a lesser extent, fiscal 2021. The negative effects initially limited our access to credit or equity capital, our ability to refinance debt and disrupted ours and our clients businesses. In fiscal 2021 and 2022, we were able to regain reasonable access to credit and equity capital markets, but also have continued to experience some lingering negative effects on our business operations in certain markets. The operations and liquidity of our operating subsidiaries were severely impacted by COVID-19. As a result and out of necessity, in fiscal 2020, we applied for and obtained financial relief in the form of funds received in exchange for promissory notes issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration SBA and U.S. Treasury under the Payroll Protection Program of the CARES Act PPP loans ). The Company and eight of its operating subsidiaries received PPP loans, totaling 19,927 thousand, and have since applied for and received forgiveness of their respective PPP loans from the SBA. The forgiveness of these loans, including their respective accrued and unpaid interest amounts, have been recognized by eliminating them from the Company s consolidated balance sheets with corresponding gains in consolidated net income in fiscal 2021 and 2022. The former PPP loans obtained by GEE Group Inc., and its operating subsidiaries together as an affiliated group, exceeded the 2 million audit threshold established by the SBA, and therefore, will be subject to audit by the SBA in the future. If any of the nine forgiven PPP loans are reinstated in whole or in part as the result of a future audit, a charge or charges would be incurred, accordingly, and they would need to be repaid. If the companies are unable to repay the portions of their PPP loans that ultimately may be reinstated from available liquidity or operating cash flow, we may be required to raise additional equity or debt capital to repay the PPP loans. 11 Table of Contents THE TERMS OF OUR SENIOR BANK ASSET BACKED LOAN AGREEMENT MAY PLACE SOME RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATING AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH COVENANTS OR TO SATISFY CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE AGREEMENT MAY RESULT IN ACCELERATION OF OUR REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS, BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS AND CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES TO DECLINE. GEE Group Inc. and its subsidiaries, Agile Resources, Inc., Access Data Consulting Corporation, BMCH, Inc., GEE Group Portfolio, Inc., Paladin Consulting, Inc., Scribe Solutions, Inc., SNI Companies, Inc., Triad Personnel Services, Inc., and Triad Logistics, Inc. are co-borrowers under a Loan, Security and Guaranty Agreement for a 20 million asset-based senior secured revolving credit facility with CIT Bank, N.A. (the CIT Facility ). The CIT Facility is collateralized by 100 of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries who are co-borrowers and/or guarantors. The CIT Facility matures on the fifth anniversary of the closing date (May 14, 2026). The CIT Facility contains some restrictions and limitations that might inhibit our ability to engage in certain activities and transactions that may otherwise be in our long-term best interests. The affirmative and negative covenants contained in the Credit Agreement that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business include covenants that limit and restrict, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, transfer or sell certain assets, issue stock of subsidiaries, pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions with respect to our capital stock or make other restricted payments, incur or permit liens or other encumbrances on assets, make certain investments, loans and advances, acquire other businesses, merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, enter into certain transactions with our affiliates and amend certain agreements, without amendment of the CIT facility or the express approval of CIT Bank. Under the CIT Facility, advances are subject to a borrowing base formula based on 85 of eligible accounts receivable of the Company and subsidiaries, as defined, and subject to certain other criteria, conditions, and applicable reserves, including any additional eligibility requirements as determined by the administrative agent. Although the stated face amount of the CIT Facility is 20 million, the borrowing base formula significantly limits amounts available for us to borrow. The CIT Facility also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment default, bankruptcy events, cross-default, breaches of covenants and representations and warranties, change of control and judgment defaults. A breach of any of these covenants could result in default under our Credit Agreement, which could prompt the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. In addition, a breach of the Credit Agreement would cause a cross-default of certain other indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If the lenders under the Credit Agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot ensure that we will have sufficient assets and funds to repay the borrowings under the Credit Agreement and our other indebtedness. An acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness could have serious consequences to our financial condition, operating results, and business, and could cause us to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy proceedings. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO GENERATE OR BORROW SUFFICIENT CASH TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION WOULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED, OUR BUSINESS COULD FAIL AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS MAY LOSE ALL OF THEIR INVESTMENT. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our obligations is dependent upon our financial and operating performance, which is affected by economic, financial, competitive, business, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. While we believe we will be able to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future and for at least the next twelve months, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to restructure or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. 12 Table of Contents THE COMPANY HAS MATERIAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL, CUSTOMER LISTS, TRADEMARKS AND TRADENAMES. THESE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT RISKS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FUTURE MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES TO INCOME AND NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY. The Company is required to evaluate its goodwill annually or when one or more triggering events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. The other long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, have to be tested for impairment only when triggering events occur or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. The Company has recognized impairments of its goodwill, including most recently during the first quarter of its fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. In testing for impairments, management applies one or more valuation techniques to estimate the fair values of the reporting units, individual assets or groups of individual assets, as required under the circumstances. These valuation techniques rely on assumptions and other factors, such as the estimated future cash flows, the discount rates used to determine the present value of associated cash flows, and the market comparable assumptions. Changes to input assumptions and other factors used or considered in the analysis could result in materially different evaluations of impairment. The valuation techniques utilized by management, for impairment testing, including estimated future cash flows, fundamentally include the inherent underlying assumption that the economy, the markets served by the Company, and the Company itself, will continue to grow. In the event the assumptions relied upon by management are not achieved, including assumed future growth rates, impairments of goodwill or other long-lived assets could be recorded and such amounts could be material to the consolidated financial statements. A reduction in the projected long-term operating performance of one or both of the Company s reporting units or other long-lived assets, future market declines, changes in discount rates or other conditions also could result in material impairments in the future. Thus, there can be no assurance that the Company s goodwill or other long-lived assets will not become impaired in the future. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SATISFY THOSE NEEDS FROM CASH GENERATED FROM OUR OPERATIONS OR BORROWINGS UNDER OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS. We require significant amounts of working capital to operate our business. We often have high receivables from our customers, and as a staffing company, we are prone to cash flow imbalances because we have to fund payroll payments to temporary workers before receiving payments from clients for our services. If we experience a significant and sustained drop in operating profits, or if there are unanticipated reductions in cash inflows or increases in cash outlays, we may be subject to cash shortfalls. If a sustained shortfall were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on our business. In particular, we use working capital to fund expenses relating to our temporary workers and our other operating expenses and liabilities. As a result, we must maintain sufficient cash availability to pay temporary workers and fund related tax liabilities prior to receiving payment from customers. In addition, our operating results tend to be unpredictable from quarter to quarter. Demand for our services is typically lower during traditional national vacation periods in the United States when customers and candidates are on vacation. No single quarter is predictive of results of future periods. Any extended period of time with low operating results or cash flow imbalances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We derive working capital for our operations through cash generated by our operating activities and borrowings under our debt instruments. If our working capital needs increase in the future, we may be forced to seek additional sources of capital, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The amount we are entitled to borrow under our debt instruments is calculated monthly based on the aggregate value of certain eligible trade accounts receivable generated from our operations, which are affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, as well as by the daily timing of cash collections and cash outflows. The aggregate value of our eligible accounts receivable may not be adequate to allow for borrowings for other corporate purposes, such as capital expenditures or growth opportunities, which could reduce our ability to react to changes in the market or industry conditions. 13 Table of Contents OUR REVENUE CAN VARY BECAUSE OUR CUSTOMERS CAN TERMINATE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AT ANY TIME WITH LIMITED OR NO PENALTY. We focus on providing professional and light industrial personnel on a temporary assignment-by-assignment basis, which customers can generally terminate at any time or reduce their level of use when compared to prior periods. To avoid large placement agency fees, large companies may use in-house personnel staff, current employee referrals, or human resources consulting companies to find and hire new personnel. Because placement agencies typically charge fees as a mark-up to the hourly pay rate or based on a percentage of the first year s salary of a new worker, companies with many jobs to fill may have a large financial incentive to avoid agencies. Our business is also significantly affected by our customers hiring needs and their views of their future prospects. Our customers may, on very short notice, terminate, reduce or postpone their recruiting assignments with us and, therefore, affect demand for our services. As a result, a significant number of our customers can terminate their agreements with us at any time, making us particularly vulnerable to a significant decrease in revenue within a short period of time that could be difficult to quickly replace. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. MOST OF OUR CONTRACTS DO NOT OBLIGATE OUR CUSTOMERS TO UTILIZE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR STAFFING SERVICES AND MAY BE CANCELLED ON LIMITED NOTICE, SO OUR REVENUE STREAM MAY BE INCONSISTENT AND IS NOT GUARANTEED. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from multi-year contracts that are terminable for convenience of the customer. Under our multi-year agreements, we contract to provide customers with staffing services through work or service orders at the customers request. Under these agreements, our customers often have little or no obligation to request our staffing services. In addition, most of our contracts are cancellable on limited notice, even if we are not in default under the contract. We may hire employees permanently to meet anticipated demand for services under these agreements that may ultimately be delayed or cancelled. We could face a significant decline in revenues and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if: we see a significant decline in the staffing services requested from us under our service agreements; or our customers cancel or defer a significant number of staffing requests; or our existing customer agreements expire or lapse and we cannot renew or replace them with similar agreements. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN A BROAD GROUP OF EXISTING CUSTOMERS, LOSE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS, OR FAIL TO ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD SUFFER. Increasing the growth and profitability of our business is particularly dependent upon our ability to retain existing customers and capture additional customers. Our ability to do so is dependent upon our ability to provide high quality services and offer competitive prices. If we are unable to execute these tasks effectively, we may not be able to attract a significant number of new customers and our existing customer base could decrease, including the loss of a significant customer, either or all of which could have an adverse impact on our revenues. SUBSTANTIAL ALTERATION OF OUR CURRENT BUSINESS AND REVENUE MODEL COULD HURT SHORT-TERM RESULTS. Our present business and revenue model represents our view of optimal business and revenue generation, which is to derive revenues and achieve profitability in the shortest period. There can be no assurance that current models will not be altered significantly or replaced with one or more alternatives driven by motivations other than near-term revenues and/or profitability (for example, building market share ahead of our competitors). Any such alteration or replacement of our current business and revenue model may ultimately result in the deferring of certain revenues in favor of potentially establishing larger market share. We cannot assure that any such adjustment or change in the business and revenue model would prove to be successful whether adopted in response to industry changes or for other reasons. 14 Table of Contents WE DEPEND ON OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE KEY EMPLOYEES OR AN INABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY SKILLED EMPLOYEES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and on certain other mission-critical individual contributors. We rely on our leadership team for the management and oversight of our business operations, including but not limited to, developing and executing our strategy, business and financial planning, research and development, marketing, sales, human resources, client services, finance, and other general and administrative functions,. From time to time, our executive management team may change from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. Employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel contain terms and conditions while employed by us, however, they also continue to be considered at will employees and, as such, they are not legally required to continue to work for us for any specified period and may terminate their employment with us at any time should they choose. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could have a serious adverse effect on our business. To execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for experienced software engineers and senior sales executives. If we are unable to attract such personnel in cities where we are located, we may need to hire in other locations, which may add to the complexity and costs of our business operations. We expect to continue to experience challenges in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Extended stay-at-home, business closure, and other restrictive orders also may be expected to impact our ability to identify, hire, and train new personnel. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our stock awards declines, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, it could adversely affect our business and future growth prospects. WE DEPEND ON ATTRACTING, INTEGRATING, MANAGING, AND RETAINING QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, integrate, manage and retain personnel who possess the skills and experience necessary to fulfill our clients needs. Our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel could be impaired by any diminution of our reputation, decrease in compensation levels relative to our competitors, modifications to our total compensation philosophy that might be perceived negatively, or aggressive competitor hiring programs. If we cannot attract, hire and retain required qualified personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be negatively impacted. Our future success also depends upon our ability to manage the successful performance of our personnel. Failure to successfully manage the performance of our personnel could affect our profitability by causing operating inefficiencies that could increase operating expenses and reduce operating income. WE DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED TEMPORARY WORKERS. In addition to the members of our own team, our success is substantially dependent on our ability to recruit and retain large numbers of qualified temporary workers who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of our customers. We are required to continually evaluate our base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing customer needs. Competition for individuals with proven professional skills is intense, and demand for these individuals is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future. 15 Table of Contents Staffing Industry Analysts, a leading industry trade organization, recently published in its September 2023 Industry Forecast update, that the U.S. Staffing Industry is expected to decline by 10 in 2023. The identified causes vary within different market verticals and scenarios, with the overall level of uncertainties that persist in the U.S. and global economies and labor markets receiving significant mention. Other cited causes of the decline particularly in light industrial and administrative and clerical markets are the rise of new B2C trends, such as Uber and DoorDash, and, in other markets, side gigs that offer alternative opportunities to potential employment candidates and increased competition amongst recruiters. WE OPERATE IN AN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND RAPIDLY CHANGING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, AND THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT OUR SERVICES COULD BECOME OBSOLETE OR UNCOMPETITIVE. The markets for our services are highly competitive and include many larger, more established companies. Our markets are characterized by pressures to provide high levels of service, incorporate new capabilities and technologies, accelerate job completion schedules and reduce prices. Furthermore, we face competition from a number of sources, including other executive search firms and professional search, staffing and consulting firms. Several of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. New and existing competitors are aided by technology, and the market has low barriers to entry. Furthermore, Internet employment sites expand a company s ability to find workers without the help of traditional agencies. Personnel agencies often work as intermediaries, helping employers accurately describe job openings and screen candidates. Increasing the use of sophisticated, automated job description and candidate screening tools could make many traditional functions of staffing companies obsolete. Specifically, the increased use of the internet may attract technology-oriented companies to the professional staffing industry. Free social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook are also becoming a common way for recruiters and employees to connect without the assistance of a staffing company. Our future success will depend largely upon our ability to anticipate and keep pace with those developments and advances. Current or future competitors could develop alternative capabilities and technologies that are more effective, easier to use or more economical than our services. In addition, we believe that, with continuing development and increased availability of IT, the industries in which we compete may attract new competitors. If our capabilities and technologies become obsolete or uncompetitive, our related sales and revenue would decrease. Due to competition, we may experience reduced margins on our services, loss of market share, and loss of customers. If we are not able to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of these and other factors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATION COULD LIMIT OUR GROWTH OR RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. We are subject to the same federal, state, and local laws as other companies conducting placement and staffing services, which are extensive. The adoption or modification of laws that affect the placement and staffing industry, including but not limited to, Federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to labor and minimum wages, workplace standards and safety, workers compensation laws, independent contractor status, the Family Medical Leave Act, Affordable Care Act, and others could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition by increasing our costs and administrative burdens. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO ACHIEVE OUR STRATEGIC GOALS. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain any additional financing that may be required to continue to expand our business. Our continued viability depends on our ability to raise capital. Changes in economic, regulatory or competitive conditions may lead to cost increases. Management may also determine that it is in our best interest to expand more rapidly than currently intended, to expand marketing activities, to develop new or enhance existing services or products, to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary services, businesses or technologies. In any such case or other change of circumstance, additional financing will be necessary. If any additional financing is required, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain such additional financing on terms acceptable to us and at times required by us, if at all. In such event, we may be required to materially alter our business plan or curtail all or a part of our expansion plans. 16 Table of Contents WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MANAGE EXPECTED GROWTH AND INTERNAL EXPANSION. Our ability to manage growth effectively will be important to our business and future results of operations and financial condition. Expansion of our resources and operations will be required to address anticipated growth of our customer base and market opportunities. Expansion may be expected to place additional strain on our management, operational and financial resources, and thereby our ability to provide quality services and support for our clients and other stakeholders. In these regards, we anticipate the need to enhance existing resources, processes and controls, including but not limited to, implementation of new operational and financial systems, and development of additional procedures and controls to expand, train and manage our growing employee base and to service new and growing customers. Our failure to manage growth effectively, therefore, could have a materially negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON TECHNOLOGY SERVICES, AND IF WE EXPERIENCE DAMAGE, SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS OR FAILURES IN OUR COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, OUR EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Our business could be interrupted by damage to or disruption of our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems, and we may lose data. Our customers businesses may be adversely affected by any system or equipment failure we experience. As a result of any of the foregoing, our relationships with our customers may be impaired, we may lose customers, our ability to attract new customers may be adversely affected and we could be exposed to contractual liability. Precautions in place to protect us from, or minimize the effect of, such events may not be adequate. If an interruption by damage to or disruption of our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems occurs, we could be liable and the market perception of our services could be harmed. WE COULD BE HARMED BY IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OR LOSS OF SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL COMPANY, EMPLOYEE, ASSOCIATE OR CLIENT DATA, INCLUDING PERSONAL DATA, BY EMPLOYEE ERROR AND/OR CYBER RISKS. In connection with the operation of our business, we store, process and transmit a large amount of data, including personnel and payment information, about our employees, clients, associates and candidates, a portion of which is confidential and/or personally sensitive. In doing so, we rely on our own technology and systems, and those of third-party vendors we use for a variety of processes. We and our third-party vendors have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. Unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential data may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs. Such disclosure, loss or breach could harm our reputation and subject us to government sanctions and liability under our contracts and laws that protect sensitive or personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. It is possible that security controls over sensitive or confidential data and other practices we and our third-party vendors follow may not prevent the improper access to, disclosure of, or loss of such information. The potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as we introduce new services and offerings, such as mobile technology. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions in which we provide services. Any failure or perceived failure to successfully manage the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, or any failure to comply with changing regulatory requirements in this area, could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace. 17 Table of Contents WE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED A NETWORK SECURITY INCIDENT AFFECTING OUR IT NETWORK, INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND STORED INFORMATION. NETWORK SECURITY INCIDENTS AFFECTING OUR SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS THIS ONE OR OTHERS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE AND HAVE WIDER-REACHING MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS. On February 1, 2022, the Company detected and stopped a network security incident. An unauthorized third party gained access into our network, encrypted various systems, and demanded money to decrypt the affected systems and to delete and not publicly release stolen information. The Company s IT professionals immediately disconnected and isolated the affected systems to prevent any further compromise. The senior executive management team was immediately notified who in turn reported the network security incident to the Company s Audit Committee chairman who has board oversight authority for these types of matters. The Company s audit committee and board of directors were fully briefed and a special committee of the board of directors was appointed to assist and oversee management in the investigations, response and full remediation of the incident. The Company engaged third party cyber security experts to assist its internal IT professionals and conducted a comprehensive investigation to determine the extent of the unauthorized activity. The Company also notified law enforcement and its cyber liability insurance carrier about the incident. The Company s investigation determined that the unauthorized third party acquired a relatively small amount of data maintained on the encrypted servers, to include in some cases, individual personal information such as names, social security numbers, passport and driver license information. Our forensic investigation has been concluded and we believe we have reasonably determined the scope of the incident. Individuals affected by this incident were sent formal notification in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. The cost of investigating and resolving the incident has been immaterial. Based on what management and the Company s third-party cyber security experts have determined in their investigation, the Company also does not foresee this incident having any future material detrimental effect on our business or financial position. The Company has in place cyber liability insurance coverage, subject to certain policy limitations and deductibles. The Company had also immediately notified the cyber insurance carrier of the network security incident, who worked with management and the Company s third-party cyber security experts on this matter. The Company s network environment is fully operational and additional security measures have been added and/or are being evaluated to prevent further intrusions. The Company has not observed any additional malicious activity on the network to date. The Company s operations were only minimally impacted by the incident, and we were able to serve our clients and other stakeholders without issue throughout. OUR STRATEGY OF GROWING THROUGH ACQUISITIONS MAY BE IMPEDED BY A LACK OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND IMPACT OUR BUSINESS IN UNEXPECTED WAYS. WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS. We intend to expand our business through acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, subject to our business plans and management s ability to identify, acquire and develop suitable acquisition or investment targets in both new and existing service categories. In certain circumstances, acceptable acquisition or investment targets might not be available. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to: difficulty in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of an acquired business, including consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure; potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day-to-day operations; difficulty entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have a stronger market position; difficulty maintaining the quality of services that such acquired companies have historically provided; impact of liabilities of the acquired businesses undiscovered or underestimated as part of the acquisition due diligence; 18 Table of Contents failure to realize anticipated growth opportunities from a combined business, because existing and potential clients may be unwilling to consolidate business with a single supplier or to stay with the acquirer post acquisition; impacts of cash on hand and debt incurred to finance acquisitions, thus increasing debt leverage and reducing liquidity for other significant strategic objectives; internal controls, disclosure controls, corruption prevention policies, human resources and other key policies and practices of the acquired companies may be inadequate or ineffective; overpayment for the acquired company or assets or failure to achieve anticipated benefits, such as cost savings synergies and revenue enhancements; increased expenses associated with completing an acquisition and amortizing any acquired intangible assets; challenges in implementing uniform standards, accounting policies, customs, controls, procedures and policies throughout an acquired business; failure to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; and loss of customers and a failure to integrate and retain customer bases. In addition, if we incur indebtedness to finance an acquisition, it may reduce our capacity to borrow additional amounts and requiring us to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the cash resources available to us to fund capital expenditures, pursue other acquisitions or investments in new business initiatives and meet general corporate and working capital needs. This increased indebtedness may also limit our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry. The use of our common stock or other securities (including those that might be convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock) to finance any such acquisition may also result in dilution of our existing shareholders. The potential risks associated with recent and future acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, result in the loss of key customers or personnel, increase expenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO EMPLOYMENT-RELATED CLAIMS AND LOSSES, INCLUDING CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. We employ people internally and in the workplaces of other businesses. Many of these individuals have access to client information systems and confidential information. The risks of these activities include possible claims relating to: discrimination and harassment; wrongful termination or denial of employment; violations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues; classification of temporary workers; 19 Table of Contents assignment of illegal aliens; violations of wage and hour requirements; retroactive entitlement to temporary worker benefits; errors and omissions by our temporary workers; release, misuse or appropriation of client intellectual property, or other confidential or other property or proprietary information; misappropriation of funds; cybersecurity breaches affecting our clients and/or us; damage to customer facilities due to negligence of temporary workers; and criminal misconduct or illegal activity by our temporary workers. We may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these problems and claims. Such claims may result in negative publicity, injunctive relief, criminal investigations and/or charges, payment by us of monetary damages or fines, or other material adverse effects on our business. In addition, these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming and expensive. New employment and labor laws and regulations may be proposed or adopted that may increase the potential exposure of employers to employment-related claims and litigation. There can be no assurance that the corporate policies we have in place to help reduce our exposure to these risks will be effective or that we will not experience losses as a result of these risks. There can also be no assurance that the insurance policies we have purchased to insure against certain risks will be adequate or that insurance coverage will remain available on reasonable terms or be sufficient in amount or scope of coverage. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYMENT-RELATED LEGAL RISK. We employ people internally and in the workplaces of other businesses. Many of these individuals have access to client information systems and confidential information. An inherent risk of such activity includes possible claims of errors and omissions; intentional misconduct; release, misuse or misappropriation of client intellectual property, confidential information, funds, or other property; cyber security breaches affecting our clients and/or us; discrimination and harassment claims; employment of illegal aliens; criminal activity; torts; or other claims. Such claims may result in negative publicity, injunctive relief, criminal investigations and/or charges, civil litigation, payment by us of monetary damages or fines, or other material adverse effects on our business. OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE OUR NET OPERATING CARRYFORWARDS AND CERTAIN OTHER TAX ATTRIBUTES MAY BE LIMITED. Federal and state tax laws impose restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss NOL and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change as defined by section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended Section 382 ). Generally, an ownership change occurs if the percentage of the value of the stock that is owned by one or more direct or indirect five percent shareholders increases by more than 50 over their lowest ownership percentage at any time during the applicable testing period (typically, three years). Under Section 382, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since we became a loss corporation as defined in Section 382. Future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change . In addition, future equity offerings or acquisitions that have equity as a component of the purchase price could result in an ownership change. If an ownership change has occurred or does occur in the future, utilization of the NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes may be limited, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. 20 Table of Contents THE MARKET PRICE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN VOLATILE, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT TO DECLINE. A MORE ACTIVE, LIQUID TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK MAY NOT DEVELOP, AND THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY. The market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. The securities markets have experienced significant volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently, significant inflation, rising interest rates, economic uncertainty and volatility and uncertainty in our labor market. Market volatility, as well as general economic, market, or political conditions, could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock regardless of our operating performance. Although our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, we cannot assure you that an active public market will develop for our common stock. There has been relatively limited trading volume in the market for our common stock, and a more active, liquid public trading market may not develop or may not be sustained. Limited liquidity in the trading market for our common stock may adversely affect a shareholder s ability to sell its shares of common stock at the time it wishes to sell them or at a price that it considers acceptable. If a more active, liquid public trading market does not develop, we may be limited in our ability to raise capital by selling shares of common stock and our ability to acquire other companies or assets by using shares of our common stock as consideration. In addition, if the relatively limited trading volumes for our stock persists, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without large enough trading volumes, our common stock may be expected to remain less liquid than the stock of other more actively traded companies and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. Furthermore, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including: our quarterly or annual operating results and financial position; adverse market reaction to changes in our indebtedness, if any; the perceived impact of the present uncertainties in the economy and labor markets on our industry and our own results; announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; litigation and government investigations; pending acquisitions, if any; investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry; additions or departures of key personnel; changes in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors; our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts projections; future changes in industry, general market or economic conditions; and changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement of laws or regulations affecting our business. 21 Table of Contents In response, the market price of shares of our common stock could decrease significantly. You may be unable to resell your shares of common stock at or above the public offering price. Following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources. OUR COMMON STOCK COULD BE DELISTED FROM THE NYSE AMERICAN IF WE DO NOT MEET ITS CONTINUED LISTING REQUIREMENTS. The NYSE American has established certain standards for the continued listing of a security on the NYSE American. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet these standards in the future to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE American. Factors that could have an impact on our ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on NYSE American include the status of the market for our common stock at the time, our reported results of operations in future periods, and general economic, market and industry conditions. If we are delisted from the NYSE American, our common stock may be eligible for trading on an over-the-counter market. In the event that we are not able to obtain a listing on another stock exchange or quotation service for our common stock, it may be extremely difficult or impossible for shareholders to sell their common stock. Moreover, if we are delisted from the NYSE American, but obtain a substitute listing for our common stock, it will likely be on a market with less liquidity, and therefore experience potentially more price volatility than experienced on the NYSE American. Shareholders may not be able to sell their common stock on any such substitute. market in the quantities, at the times, or at the prices that could potentially be available on a more liquid trading market. As a result of these factors, if our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, the price of our common stock is likely to decline. A delisting of our common stock from the NYSE American could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for our operations and/or result in a loss of confidence by investors, or employees. WE HAVE NO CURRENT PLANS TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK; AS A RESULT, YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE ANY RETURN ON INVESTMENT UNLESS YOU SELL YOUR COMMON STOCK FOR A PRICE GREATER THAN THAT WHICH YOU PAID FOR IT. We intend to retain a substantial portion of future earnings for use in the development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. We are presently repurchasing our own common shares in the open market, under authorization of our board of directors and in accordance with applicable Federal and state laws, regulations and rules. However, any future determination to pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws. It will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, general business conditions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends is restricted by the terms of our debt financing arrangements, and any future debt financing arrangement likely will contain terms restricting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. THERE MAY BE FUTURE SALES OF OUR SECURITIES OR OTHER DILUTION OF OUR EQUITY, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to finance our operations, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations. We have experienced losses from operations and negative operating cash flow in the past and have an accumulated deficit. We have had to raise additional funds in order to deleverage, recapitalize and finance our current operations and may have to in the future if we are unable to sustain our current operations and results. If additional capital is not available to us when and if needed or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our business plan or we may have to discontinue our operations entirely. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-backed securities may be expected to dilute our shareholders ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the market value of our equity securities. The terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then outstanding. 22 Table of Contents If we are unable to secure additional funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to defer, reduce or eliminate significant planned expenditures, restructure, curtail or eliminate some or all of our operations, dispose of technology or assets, pursue an acquisition of our company by a third party at a price that may result in a loss on investment for our shareholders, file for bankruptcy or cease operations altogether. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain additional funds on a timely basis, there will be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and increased risk of insolvency and up to a total loss of investment by our shareholders. PROVISIONS IN OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED, OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED BY-LAWS, AS AMENDED AND ILLINOIS LAW MIGHT DISCOURAGE, DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF OUR COMPANY OR CHANGES IN OUR MANAGEMENT AND, THEREFORE, DEPRESS THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. Provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, our amended and restated by-laws, as amended, and Illinois law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include, but are not limited to: restrictions on the ability of shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders. Special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, our president, a majority of the members of the board of directors, or by one or more shareholders holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not less than 20 of the votes at the special meeting; establishing a staggered board of directors. Our board is divided into three classes, each of which shall serve for a term of three years, with only one class of directors being elected in each year. As a result, successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election; requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our shareholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors; the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without shareholder approval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and restrictions pursuant to the Illinois Business Corporation Act (the IBCA that prohibit a publicly held Illinois corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years following the time the person became an interested shareholder, unless the business combination or the acquisition of shares that resulted in a shareholder becoming an interested shareholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested shareholder. Generally, an interested shareholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within three years prior to the determination of interested shareholder status did own) 15 or more of a corporation s voting stock. The existence of this provision would be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for our stock. 23 Table of Contents The existence of the forgoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition. IF SECURITIES OR INDUSTRY ANALYSTS DO NOT PUBLISH OR CEASE PUBLISHING RESEARCH OR REPORTS ABOUT US, OUR BUSINESS OR OUR MARKET, OR IF THEY CHANGE THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING OUR STOCK ADVERSELY, OUR STOCK PRICE AND TRADING VOLUME COULD DECLINE. The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. A POSSIBLE SHORT SQUEEZE DUE TO A SUDDEN INCREASE IN DEMAND OF OUR COMMON STOCK THAT LARGELY EXCEEDS SUPPLY MAY LEAD TO FURTHER PRICE VOLATILITY IN OUR COMMON STOCK. Investors may purchase our common stock to hedge existing exposure in our common stock or to speculate on the price of our common stock. Speculation on the price of our common stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our common stock available for purchase in the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase our common stock for delivery to lenders of our common stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of our common stock until investors with short exposure are able to purchase additional common shares to cover their short position. This is referred to as a short squeeze in lay terms. A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in our common stock that are not directly correlated to the performance or prospects of our company and once investors purchase the shares of common stock necessary to cover their short position the price of our common stock may decline. THE REQUIREMENTS OF BEING A PUBLIC COMPANY MAY STRAIN OUR FINANCIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES AND DISTRACT MANAGEMENT. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ). These requirements are extensive. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. We incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and costs associated with applicable corporate governance requirements. These applicable rules and regulations significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly than privately owned companies that are not SEC registrants. This also may divert management s attention from other business concerns, which must be balanced so as not to cause material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also believe compliance risks associated with these rules and regulations tend to make it more difficult and expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance and could result in our need to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. 24 Table of Contents Additionally, shareholder activism, the current political environment, and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CURRENT AND POTENTIAL SHAREHOLDERS MAY LOSE CONFIDENCE IN OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the SEC rules require that our management report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures. Among other things, our management must conduct an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. While we are not aware of any material weaknesses, we cannot assure you that one or more will not be identified in the future. Any failure to implement or maintain required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, or could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. These misstatements could result in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, reduce our ability to obtain financing or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price. THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, AND MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY OCCUR AND NOT BE DETECTED. The ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require us to identify material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the Company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. In addition, discovery and disclosure of a material weakness, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Such an occurrence could discourage certain customers or suppliers from doing business with us, cause downgrades in our future debt ratings leading to higher borrowing costs and affect how our stock trades. This could, in turn, negatively affect our ability to access public debt or equity markets for capital. 25 Table of Contents OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS. Customers demand for our services may fluctuate widely with changes in economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. Those conditions include slower employment growth or reductions in employment, which directly impact our service offerings. As a staffing company, our revenue depends on the number of jobs we fill, which in turn depends on economic growth. During economic slowdowns, many customer companies stop hiring altogether. For example, in prior economic downturns, many employers in our operating regions reduced their overall workforce to reflect the slowing demand for their products and services. We may face lower demand and increased pricing pressures during these periods, which this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. INTERRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESS COULD RESULT FROM INCREASED SECURITY MEASURES IN RESPONSE TO TERRORISM OR CIVIL UNREST. The continued threat of terrorism within the United States and the ongoing military action and heightened security measures in response to such threat has and may cause significant disruption to commerce. The U.S. economy, in general, is being adversely affected by terrorist activities and the potential activities for terrorist activities or other civil unrest. Any resulting economic downturn could adversely impact our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely affect our ability to grow the business. It is impossible to predict how this may affect our business or the economy in the U.S. and in the world. In the event of further threats or acts of terrorism or civil unrest, our business and operations may be further severely and adversely affected. OUR BUSINESS MAY BE IMPACTED BY POLITICAL EVENTS, WAR, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, INCLEMENT WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS. War, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to commerce and the economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on us and our customers. Two wars are now being waged at the global level, the first led by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the second, following the recent invasion of Israel by Hamas terrorists. These and continuing overtures by China over Taiwan and the South China Sea, also add instability to the uncertainty driving socioeconomic forces, which in turn, impact the Company s and its subsidiaries operations. Our business operations also are subject to interruption by, among others, inclement weather, natural disasters, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks, civil unrest and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond our control. Such events could decrease demand for our services. OUR COMPLIANCE WITH COMPLICATED REGULATIONS CONCERNING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE HAS RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES. We are faced with expensive, complicated and evolving disclosure, governance and compliance laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure. New standards are developing concerning environmental, social and governance matters ESG and other emerging socioeconomic trends and matters. In addition, as a staffing company, we are regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and often by state authorities. New or changing laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing compliance work. Our failure to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to U.S. public companies could subject us or our management to regulatory scrutiny or sanction, which could harm our reputation and stock price. Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. 26 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CHALLENGES AT OTHER BANKING INSTITUTIONS COULD LEAD TO DEPOSITOR CONCERNS THAT SPREAD WITHIN THE BANKING INDUSTRY CAUSING DISRUPTIVE DEPOSIT OUTFLOWS AND OTHER DESTABILIZING RESULTS. In March and April 2023, certain specialized banking institutions with elevated concentrations of uninsured deposits experienced large deposit outflows coupled with insufficient liquidity to meet withdrawal demands, resulting in the institutions being placed into Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC receiverships. In the aftermath, there has been market disruption and indications that diminished depositor confidence could spread across the banking industry, leading to deposit outflows and other destabilizing results. The Federal Reserve Board announced that it would provide funding to ensure that banks have sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of their depositors, but there can be no assurance whether such funding will be adequate to fully address these issues. The Company currently has bank deposits with financial institutions in the U.S. that exceed FDIC insurance limits. However, the Company has taken measures to diversify its deposit base, that are intended to mitigate and minimize its potential exposure to losses as a result of maintaining cash deposits in accounts that exceed FDIC insurance limits. Among these, during fiscal 2023, the Company established, and initially deposited 13 million of its excess cash, under a brokerage arrangement with a major financial advisory institution that manages and deposits these funds under a specialized program whereby the funds are allocated among FDIC insured banks in amounts that individually do not exceed the established FDIC insured limit of 250 thousand. To date, the Company has not experienced any material loss as a result of the failure of any financial institution in which it has funds or other assets on deposit. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable. Item 2. Properties. The Company s policy is to lease (rather than purchase) commercial office space for all of its offices. The Company s headquarters are located with one of its branch locations in Jacksonville Florida, for which the applicable lease expires in 2026. The Company markets its services using the trade names General Employment Enterprises, Omni One, Ashley Ellis, Agile Resources, Scribe Solutions Inc., Access Data Consulting Corporation, Paladin Consulting Inc., SNI Companies, Accounting Now, Staffing Now , SNI Banking, SNI Certes , SNI Energy , SNI Financial , SNI Technology , Triad Personnel Services and Triad Staffing. As of September 30, 2023, we operated from locations in eleven (11) states, including twenty-six (26) branch offices in downtown or suburban areas of major U.S. cities and four (4) additional U.S. locations utilizing local staff members working remotely. We have offices or serve markets remotely, as follows; (i) one office in each of Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota, and New Jersey, and one remote local market presence in Virginia; (ii) two offices each in Georgia and Massachusetts; (iii) three offices in Colorado; (iv) two offices and two additional local market presences in Texas; (v) six offices and one additional local market presence in Florida; and (vi) seven offices in Ohio. Established offices are operated from leased spaces ranging from 800 to 7,500 square feet, and generally for initial lease periods of one to seven years, with cancellation clauses after certain periods of occupancy in some cases. Management believes that existing facilities are adequate for the Company s current needs and that its leasing strategies provide the Company with sufficient flexibility to open or close offices to accommodate business needs. As the Company s leases for its existing offices near their expiration or renewal dates, the Company evaluates the continued necessity for maintaining the location, including consideration of matters ranging from whether they are in close proximity of other available service offices, proximity and importance of a local presence to existing clients and as a competitive advantage in the local market, the size and number of staff located there, whether staff have the means to work effectively on a remote basis supported by resources available from other larger locations, and other factors.

Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Market Information The Company s common stock is listed on the NYSE American and is traded under the symbol JOB. Holders of Record There were 745 holders of record of the Company s common stock on September 30, 2023. Dividends No dividends were declared or paid during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Share Repurchase Program On April 27, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to an aggregate of 20 million of the Company s currently outstanding shares of common stock. The share repurchase program will continue through December 31, 2023, may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate the Company to repurchase any number of shares of common stock. The share repurchase program is being conducted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Subject to applicable rules and regulations, the shares of common stock may be purchased from time to time in the open market transactions and in amounts as the Company deems appropriate, based on factors such as market conditions, legal requirements, and other business considerations. The Company has conducted repurchases consistently since the program s implementation and intends to continue to take advantage of the present attractive market prices for its common stock. Our purchases of our common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2023, were as follows: Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program (a) July 1, 2023 - July 31, 2023 584,098 0.51 584,098 19,245,696 August 1, 2023 - August 31, 2023 809,371 0.60 809,371 18,762,928 September 1, 2023 - September 30, 2023 1,147,615 0.59 1,147,615 18,084,617 2,541,084 2,541,084 (a) Excludes brokerage commissions paid by the Company. As of December 15, 2023, the Company has repurchased 5,808,053 shares of its common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program (accounting for approximately 5.1 of our issued and outstanding common shares immediately prior to the program). 28 Table of Contents Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans As of September 30, 2023, there were stock options outstanding under the Company s Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Plan. The plan granted specified numbers of options to non-employee directors, and they authorized the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to grant either restricted stock and incentive or non-statutory stock options to employees. Effective July 13, 2022, the tenth anniversary of the Plan, incentive stock options are no longer eligible to be granted. Vesting periods are established by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant. All stock options outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 were non-qualified stock options, had exercise prices equal to the market price on the date of grant, and had expiration dates ten years from the date of grant. The maximum number of shares that may be granted under the 2013 Plan is 15 million (7,500 thousand for restricted stock grants and 7,500 thousand for stock option grants). This number is subject to adjustment to reflect changes in the capital structure or organization of the Company.

Paladin in January 2016, and SNI Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation SNI in April 2017, expanded our geographical footprint within the professional placement and contract staffing verticals or end markets of information technology, accounting, finance, office, engineering professionals, and medical scribes. The Company markets its services using the trade names General Employment Enterprises, Omni One, Ashley Ellis, Agile Resources, Scribe Solutions Inc., Access Data Consulting Corporation, Paladin Consulting Inc., SNI Companies (including Staffing Now, Accounting Now, and Certes), Triad Personnel Services and Triad Staffing. As of September 30, 2023, we operated from locations in eleven (11) states, including twenty-six (26) branch offices in downtown or suburban areas of major U.S. cities and four (4) additional U.S. locations utilizing local staff members working remotely.

Management has implemented a strategy which includes organic and acquisition growth components. Management s organic growth strategy includes seeking out and winning new client business, as well as expansion of existing client business and on-going cost reduction and productivity improvement efforts in operations. Management s acquisition growth strategy includes identifying strategic, accretive acquisitions, financed primarily through a combination of cash and debt, including seller financing, the issuance of equity in appropriate circumstances, and the use of earn-outs where efficient to improve the overall profitability and cash flows of the Company. The Company s contract and placement services are principally provided under two operating divisions or segments: Professional Staffing Services and Industrial Staffing Services. We believe our current segments and array of businesses and brands within our segments complement one another and position us for future growth. 30 Table of Contents (Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated) Results of Operations Fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 fiscal 2023 ), and fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 fiscal 2022 Summary and Outlook Fiscal 2023 results declined from those of fiscal 2022, as expected, primarily as the result of economic and labor market uncertainties and instability, which negatively impacted the numbers of orders and candidates available to fill orders across our businesses. Fiscal 2022 also was an above average year in terms of performance, and while fiscal 2023 results were lower overall, the Company once again was profitable and generated positive cash flow from operations, as it has consistently done since completion of the significant deleveraging initiatives and a follow-on offering during the quarter ended June 30, 2021. We also believe our top line performance was in line with our industry peers and above average in regards to our IT brands. Our lowest performing businesses continued to be those serving light industrial and office clerical markets. We are cautiously optimistic about our ability to return to growth once again, and especially in our largest professional services businesses, led by IT, as uncertainties and unknowns about the economy and labor environments lessen. We experienced twelve quarters of cumulative pre-tax income during our fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2023, for purposes of evaluation of our deferred income tax valuation allowance, which had been set at 100 of our net deferred tax assets. As a result of this and our evaluations of other positive and negative evidence, we have recognized a net deferred tax benefit of 7,249 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, which accounted for approximately 0.06 of this period s earnings per share. The reversal of this allowance during fiscal 2023 represented a significant milestone and indication of our progress. We also implemented a 20 million share repurchase program during fiscal 2023, providing a means to return excess capital to our shareholders from our growing cash balances. As of September 30, 2023, we had repurchased 3,411 shares. As of December 15, 2023, the Company has repurchased 5,808 shares (accounting for approximately 5.1 of our issued and outstanding common shares immediately prior to the program). The Company has conducted repurchases consistently since the program s implementation and intends to continue to take advantage of the present attractive market prices for its common shares. Net Revenues Consolidated net revenues are comprised of the following: Fiscal 2023 2022 Change Change Professional contract services 120,046 122,562 (2,516 (2) Industrial contract services 13,005 15,945 (2,940 (18) Total contract services revenues 133,051 138,507 (5,456 (4) Direct hire placement services 19,392 26,605 (7,213 (27) Consolidated net revenues 152,443 165,112 (12,669 (8) Contract staffing services contributed 133,051, or approximately 87 , of consolidated revenue and direct hire placement services contributed 19,392, or approximately 13 , of consolidated revenue for fiscal 2023. This compares to contract staffing services revenue of 138,507, or approximately 84 , of consolidated revenue and direct hire placement revenue of 26,605, or approximately 16 , of consolidated revenue for fiscal 2022. As a result of the economic headwinds encountered during fiscal 2023, including persistent inflation and threats of recession, consolidated contract staffing services revenues for fiscal 2023 were down only 5,456, or 4 , when compared to fiscal 2022. Professional contract services revenue decreased by 2,516, or 2 , which can be attributed to completion of certain discreet (non-recurring) projects in fiscal 2022, including professional staffing support provided to former COVID-19 response vaccination and testing facilities. These discreet projects generated 3,152 in revenue during fiscal 2022. Excluding the effects of these discreet projects, professional contract services revenues would have increased 636, or 0.5 , during fiscal 2023. Industrial staffing services revenues decreased by 2,940, or 18 , mainly due to a decrease in orders from clients. Our industrial staffing markets in Ohio, as well as office clerical markets in various locations, continue to be affected by workforce volatility following COVID-19, resulting in more competition for orders and temporary labor to fill orders. According to a U.S. Staffing Industry Forecast report published in September 2023 by Staffing Industry Analysts, U.S. staffing industry revenues are expected to decline 10 over the 2023 calendar year. 31 Table of Contents (Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated) Direct hire placement revenue for fiscal 2023 decreased by 7,213, or 27 , over fiscal 2022. Direct hire opportunities tend to be highly cyclical and demand dependent, tending to rise during economic recovery and decline during downturns. Demand for the Company s direct hire services in fiscal 2022 was extraordinarily high driven by post-COVID employment recovery trends, and is down in 2023 on the presence of economic uncertainties . Management believes that the Company s direct hire performance during fiscal 2023 was on par with larger employment and industry trends. Cost of Contract Services Cost of contract services includes wages and related payroll taxes, employee benefits of the Company's contract services employees, and certain other employee-related costs, while they work on contract assignments. Cost of contract services for fiscal 2023 decreased by approximately 4 to 99,571 compared to 103,434 for fiscal 2022. The 3,863 decrease in cost of contract services is consistent with the decrease in revenues as discussed above. Gross Profit percentage by service: Fiscal 2023 2022 Professional contract services 26.1 26.6 Industrial contract services 16.5 15.4 Consolidated contract services 25.2 25.3 Direct hire placement services (1) 100.0 100.0 Combined gross profit margin (1) 34.7 37.4 (1) Includes gross profit from direct hire placements, for which all associated costs are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company s combined gross profit margin, including direct hire placement services (recorded at 100 gross margin) for fiscal 2023 was approximately 34.7 versus approximately 37.4 for fiscal 2022. The substantial portion of the decline in fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022, is due to the corresponding declines in the volume and mix of direct hire placement revenues in fiscal 2023. In the professional contract staffing services segment, the gross margin excluding direct placement services was approximately 26.1 for fiscal 2023 compared to approximately 26.6 for fiscal 2022. This decrease is due in part to increases in contractor pay associated with the recent rise in inflation resulting in some margin compression. The Company stepped-up counter-inflationary measures during the second half of fiscal 2023, including seeking increases in bill rates and spreads, where possible, to address margin compression. The Company s industrial staffing services gross margin for fiscal 2023 was approximately 16.5 as compared with approximately 15.4 for fiscal 2022. This increase is mainly attributable to price increases enacted to offset increases in contractor payroll and achieve higher spreads in the Industrial segment. 32 Table of Contents (Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated) Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include the following categories: Compensation and benefits in the operating divisions, which includes salaries, wages and commissions earned by the Company s employment consultants, recruiters and branch managers on permanent and temporary placements; Administrative compensation, which includes salaries, wages, share-based compensation, payroll taxes and employee benefits associated with general management and the operation of corporate functions, including principally, finance, human resources, information technology and administrative functions; Occupancy costs, which includes office rent, and other office operating expenses; Recruitment advertising, which includes the cost of identifying and tracking job applicants; and Other selling, general and administrative expenses, which includes travel, bad debt expense, fees for outside professional services and other corporate-level expenses such as business insurance and taxes. The Company s SG A for fiscal 2023 decreased by 4,336 as compared to fiscal 2022. SG A for fiscal 2023 as a percentage of revenue was approximately 31.2 versus 31.4 for fiscal 2022. The decrease in SG A relative to revenue, despite the effects of inflation on compensation and other operating costs, is largely a result of certain cost reductions implemented by the Company during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. These cost reductions were expected to provide annual savings of approximately 4.0 million. The Company monitors operating costs including the impacts of inflation with a view towards identifying and taking advantage of potential cost reductions on a routine basis. SG A includes certain non-cash costs and expenses incurred related to acquisition, integration and restructuring and other non-recurring activities, such as certain corporate legal and general expenses associated with capital markets activities that either are not directly associated with core business operations or have been eliminated on a going forward basis. These costs were 838 and 2,060 for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, and include mainly expenses associated with former closed and consolidated locations, legal fees and a settlement, and personnel costs associated with eliminated positions. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation expense was 383 and 371 for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in depreciation expense is due to recent net additions to fixed assets. Amortization expense was 2,879, and 3,469 for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease is due to intangible assets related to certain non-compete agreements and trade names becoming fully amortized. Goodwill Impairment The Company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2023 and determined that its goodwill was not impaired. During fiscal 2022, as of December 31, 2021, an interim assessment was performed as the amount of discount inherent in the Company s market capitalization as reported on the NYSE American exchange when compared with consolidated stockholders equity, or net book value, had increased since the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2021. The estimated fair values of its Professional Services and Industrial Services reporting units were adjusted based on qualitative and quantitative analysis so that they reconciled more precisely with the Company s market capitalization as of December 31, 2021, plus an assumed control premium. As a result, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of 2,150 during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Upon completion of the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2022, it was determined that the Company s goodwill was not impaired. Income from Operations Income from operations was 2,033 and 3,775 for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. This decrease of 1,742 is consistent with the decrease in revenues, mainly in direct hire placements, as discussed above, and taking into account the goodwill impairment charge of 2,150 included in fiscal 2022 income from operations. 33 Table of Contents (Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated) Interest Expense Interest expense decreased by 41 to 336 for fiscal 2023 from 377 for fiscal 2022. Interest Income The Company began holding excess cash in interest bearing accounts in August 2022 on which interest income earned was 472 and 16 in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes The Company recognized income tax benefits (expense) of 7,249 and (588) for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our effective tax rates for fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 are lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the effect of the change in valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset DTA position. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. As of June 30, 2023, in part due to the fact that in the current year we achieved three years of cumulative pretax income, management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred taxes are realizable. As a result, the Company released 7,581 of the valuation allowance accordingly during fiscal 2023. Net Income The Company s net income was 9,418 and 19,599 for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition to the changes in income from operations as outlined above, the decrease is primarily due to gains of 16,773 recorded in fiscal 2022 from forgiveness and extinguishment of the Company s remaining PPP loans, offset by the deferred tax benefit of 7,249 during fiscal 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary sources of liquidity for the Company are revenues earned and collected from its clients and borrowings available under its asset-based senior secured revolving credit facility. Uses of liquidity include primarily the costs and expenses necessary to fund operations, including payment of compensation to the Company s contract and permanent employees, employment-related expenses, operating costs and expenses, taxes and capital expenditures. The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of cash flows data: Fiscal 2023 2022 Cash flows provided by operating activities 5,890 9,396 Cash flows used in investing activities (89 (328 Cash flows used in financing activities (2,178 (167 As of September 30, 2023, the Company had 22,471 of cash which was an increase of 3,623 from 18,848 as of September 30, 2022. The Company reported 5,890 and 9,396 in cash flow from operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had working capital of 30,290 compared to 26,643 as of September 30, 2022. The increase in working capital is mainly attributable to positive cash flow from operations less purchases of treasury stock during fiscal 2023. Cash flows were reduced by installment payments of deferred payroll taxes under the CARES Act from fiscal 2020, of 1,847 each, during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The primary uses of cash for investing activities were for the acquisition of property and equipment, principally information technology equipment, during fiscal 2023 and 2022. 34 Table of Contents (Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated) The cash flows used in financing activities were for purchases of treasury stock during fiscal 2023, and payments made on finance leases during fiscal 2023 and 2022. The Company had approximately 11,251 in availability for borrowings under its CIT facility as of September 30, 2023. There were no outstanding borrowings on the CIT Facility as of September 30, 2023, or September 30, 2022, except for certain accrued carrying fees and costs, which are included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. On April 27, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to an aggregate of 20 million of the Company s currently outstanding shares of common stock. The share repurchase program will continue through December 31, 2023, may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate the Company to repurchase any number of shares of common stock. The share repurchase program is to be conducted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Subject to applicable rules and regulations, the shares of common stock may be purchased from time to time in the open market transactions and in amounts as the Company deems appropriate, based on factors such as market conditions, legal requirements, and other business considerations. During fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased 3,411 shares of its common stock at a total cost of 1,984. As of December 15, 2023, the Company has repurchased 5,808 shares (accounting for approximately 5.1 of our issued and outstanding common shares immediately prior to the program). All the Company s office facilities are leased. Minimum lease payments under all the Company s lease agreements for the twelve-month period commencing after the close of business on September 30, 2023, are approximately 1,669. There are no minimum debt service principal payments due during the twelve-month period commencing after the close of business on September 30, 2023. Management believes that the Company can generate adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the foreseeable future and at least for the next twelve months after the date this Annual Report on Form 10-K is filed. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, and during the two fiscal years then ended, there were no transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements to which an unconsolidated entity was a party, under which the Company (a) had any direct or contingent obligation under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest in the unconsolidated entity, or (b) had a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to the unconsolidated entity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Management makes estimates and assumptions that can affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the amounts of reported revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Those estimates and assumptions typically involve expectations about events to occur subsequent to the balance sheet date, and it is possible that actual results could ultimately differ from the estimates. If differences were to occur in a subsequent period, the Company would recognize those differences when they became known. Significant accounting and disclosure matters requiring the use of estimates and assumptions include, but may not be limited to, revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, determining fair values of financial assets and liabilities, income tax provisions and benefits, including deferred income tax valuation allowances, accounting for asset impairments, and accounting for share-based compensation. Management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, based on information that is available at the time they are made. 35 Table of Contents (Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated) The following accounting policies are considered by management to be critical because of the judgments and uncertainties involved, and because different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Revenue Recognition Our revenues are recognized when promised services are performed for customers, and in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Our revenues are recorded net of variable consideration such as sales adjustments or allowances. Direct hire placement service revenues from contracts with customers are recognized when employment candidates accept offers of employment, less a provision for estimated credits or refunds to customers as the result of applicants not remaining employed for the entirety of the Company's guarantee period (referred to as falloffs ). The Company s guarantee periods for permanently placed employees generally range from 60 to 90 days from the date of hire. Falloffs and refunds during the period, including estimates for future falloffs associated with revenues that have been recognized, are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction of placement service revenues and in the consolidated balance sheets, in combination with allowance for uncollectible accounts, as a reduction of accounts receivable. Estimated future falloffs are determined by analyzing recent historical trends of actual falloffs and applying a formula comprised of average numbers of falloffs, average falloff amounts, and average cycle times between billing and fall off dates to derive an allowance for falloffs. Thus, the estimated allowance is derived from observed trends in actual historical falloffs and assumes that historical trends are indicative of future falloff activity. Temporary staffing service revenues from contracts with customers are recognized in amounts for which the Company has a right to invoice, as the services are rendered by the Company s temporary employees. The Company records temporary staffing revenue on a gross basis as a principal versus on a net basis as an agent in the presentation of revenues and expenses. The Company has concluded that gross reporting is appropriate because the Company controls the specified service before that service is performed for a customer. The Company has the risk of identifying and hiring qualified employees, has the discretion to select the employees and establish their price, and bears the risk for services that are not fully paid for by customers. Accounts Receivable The Company extends credit to its various customers based on evaluation of the customer s financial condition and ability to pay the Company in accordance with the payment terms. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded, as a charge to bad debt expense, where collection is considered to be doubtful due to credit issues. An allowance for placement falloffs is recorded, as a reduction of revenues, for estimated losses due to applicants not remaining employed for the Company s guarantee period. These allowances together reflect management s estimate of the potential losses inherent in the accounts receivable balances, based on historical loss statistics and known factors impacting its customers. Management believes that the nature of the contract service business, wherein client companies are generally dependent on our contract employees in the same manner as permanent employees for their production cycles and the conduct of their respective businesses contributes to a relatively small accounts receivable allowance. Fair Value Measurement The Company follows the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ), Accounting Standards Codification ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances fair value measurement disclosure. Under these provisions, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances when observable inputs are not available. The hierarchy is described below: 36 Table of Contents (Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated) Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. Level 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets but corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes , which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it is believed these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In the event it is determined that the Company would not be able to realize the entire amount of recorded deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would increase the provision for income taxes. The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits are recognized on the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, no accrued interest or penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill The Company evaluates its goodwill for possible impairment as prescribed by FASB ASU 2017-04 , Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, at least annually and on an interim basis when one or more triggering events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. Under this guidance, annual or interim goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. The Company performed annual goodwill impairment testing effective as of September 30, 2023, and allocated its goodwill among two reporting units: its professional reporting unit and its industrial reporting unit for purposes of evaluation for impairments. In determining the fair value of our two reporting units, we use one or a combination of commonly accepted valuation methodologies: (1) the income approach, which is based on the present value of discounted cash flows projected for the reporting unit or, in certain instances, capitalization of earnings, and (2) the market approach, which estimates a fair value based on an appropriate revenue and/or earnings multiple(s) derived from comparable companies. These valuation techniques rely upon assumptions and other factors, such as the estimated future cash flows of our reporting units, the discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows, and the market multiples of comparable companies utilized. In applying our methods, we consider and use averages and medians in the selection of assumptions derived from comparable companies or market data, where applicable, and in the application of the income and/or market approaches if we determine that this will provide a more appropriate estimated fair value or range of fair value estimates of the reporting units. Changes to input assumptions and other factors used or considered in the analysis could result in materially different evaluations of goodwill impairment. 37 Table of Contents (Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated) For purposes of performing this goodwill impairment assessment, management applied the valuation techniques and assumptions to its professional and industrial segments as reporting units discussed above; and also considered recent trends in the Company s stock price, implied control or acquisition premiums, earnings, and other possible factors and their effects on estimated fair value of the Company s reporting units. As a result of the evaluation performed, the estimated fair values exceeded the carrying values of its net assets of the Company s professional and industrial reporting units as of September 30, 2023. Intangible Assets Separately identifiable intangible assets held in the form of customer relationships and trade names were recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to ten years using both accelerated and straight-line methods. Impairment of Long-lived Assets (other than Goodwill) The Company recognizes an impairment of long-lived intangible assets used in operations, other than goodwill, when events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired and the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets over their remaining lives are less than the carrying amount of those items. The net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value, which is typically calculated using the discounted cash flow method. For purposes of testing the long-lived assets other than goodwill, long-lived assets are grouped and considered with other assets and liabilities within the professional and industrial reporting units. The Company did not record any impairments to its long-lived assets during fiscal 2023 and 2022. Share-Based Compensation The Company accounts for share-based awards to employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation , which requires compensation expense related to share-based transactions, including employee stock options, to be measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on a determination of the fair value of the stock options or restricted stock grants. The grant date fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton ("Black-Scholes") pricing model. For all employee stock options and restricted stock grants, the Company recognizes expense over the employee's requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant) and records an estimate for forfeitures. The Company's option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, and expected term. Any changes in these subjective assumptions significantly impact our share-based compensation expense. See Note 10 for the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of share-based employee and non-employee compensation. Upon the exercise of options, it is the Company's policy to issue new shares rather than utilizing treasury shares. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopte d In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) , which enhances prior reportable segment disclosure requirements in part by requiring entities to disclose significant expenses related to their reportable segments. The guidance also requires disclosure of the Chief Operating Decision Maker's CODM position for each segment and detail of how the CODM uses financial reporting to assess their segment s performance. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company does not expect implementation of the new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses , authoritative guidance amending how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The guidance requires the application of a current expected credit loss model, which is a new impairment model based on expected losses. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is still evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements but does not expect implementation of the new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. No other recent accounting pronouncements were issued by FASB and the SEC that are believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future financial statements. Item 7A.

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of GEE Group Inc. (the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) related to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. F-2 Table of Contents Goodwill Impairment Assessment As of September 30, 2023, the Company s goodwill was 61.3 million. As discussed in Notes 2 and 6 of the financial statements, the Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually, as of September 30, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company performed a Step 1 analysis as of September 30, 2023, for the Company s annual impairment test, and the analysis noted no impairment of goodwill as of such date. The Company s goodwill impairment analysis relies on assumptions and other factors, such as industry multiples applied to earnings, estimated future cash flows, the discount rates used to determine the present value of associated cash flows, and market comparable assumptions. We identified the goodwill impairment assessment as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination are the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in evaluating management s significant assumptions used in the impairment analyses, particularly as it relates to industry multiples applied to earnings, estimated future cash flows, the discount rates used to determine the present value of associated cash flows, and market comparable assumptions. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: Obtained an understanding of management s process for developing fair value estimates. Tested the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the Company s analysis. Evaluated the significant management assumptions utilized in the estimated future cash flows by comparing revenues and performance in management s forecast to periods incurred to-date subsequent to September 30, 2023, and assessed the forecasts of revenues and expenses and the gross margin impact in future periods.

The Incentive Stock Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to grant either incentive or non-statutory stock options to employees. Vesting periods are established by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant. As of September 30, 2023, there were shares available to be granted under the Plan shares available for restricted stock grants and shares available for non-qualified stock option grants). Restricted Stock The Company has granted and shares of restricted stock during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Of the restricted shares granted during fiscal 2023, were granted to new members of the Board of Directors upon their election in fiscal 2023. During fiscal 2022, the Company granted shares of restricted stock to a non-executive member of management. On September 27, 2022, the Company adopted a new annual incentive compensation program AICP for its executives to be administered under the Company s Incentive Stock Plan, under which the remaining shares granted in fiscal 2023 were awarded. The AICP includes a long-term incentive LTI compensation plan in the form of restricted stock awards comprised of two components: one that vests based on future service only, and a second that vests based on future service and performance. Initial awards under both service-only and service plus performance-based components of the AICP LTI plan are determined based on financial performance measures for the immediately preceding fiscal year. During fiscal 2023, 551 of the 592 restricted shares granted under the AICP were granted based on actual results for fiscal 2022, as measured against corresponding financial targets for that year, and will cliff vest as of December 2, 2025. The remaining 41 of the 592 restricted shares granted under the AICP during fiscal 2023, represent the earned portion of the initial performance-based shares granted based on fiscal 2022 results, as adjusted for the outcome with regard to the financial targets applicable to those shares set by the Company s board of directors for fiscal 2023. The final 41 restricted shares of the initial portion of the fiscal 2022 service plus performance-based restricted shares granted were determined based on the actual financial performance of the Company for fiscal 2023 and will cliff vest on December 2, 2025, the third anniversary from their date of grant. Under the AICP LTI plan, the service plus performance-based grants of 41 restricted shares during fiscal 2023 represent the first tranche of a three-year schedule of awards. The next two tranches of up to 262 shares each (up to an additional restricted shares in total) are scheduled to become effective as the Company s financial plans and targets are set by the board of directors prior to each anniversary date for each of the two subsequent fiscal years, respectively. As the vesting of the two subsequent tranches will be based in part on performance conditions that have not yet been determined, the grant dates and fair values of these scheduled awards will be established in the future. The end of the requisite service periods for the 592 restricted shares granted under the AICP during fiscal 2023, plus the additional 524 restricted shares eligible to be granted in the future, once the performance conditions are determined for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, is December 2, 2025. Therefore, the remaining two tranches of the fiscal 2022 service plus performance-based awards may be expected to have grant dates corresponding with the establishment of the fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 financial performance targets by the Company s board of directors. However, all final shares determined for each of the two subsequent annual tranches also will cliff vest on December 2, 2025. F-18 Table of Contents GEE GROUP INC.

Of the million of federal net operating losses, million can be carried indefinitely. Future realization of the tax benefits of existing temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company performed an evaluation to determine whether a valuation allowance was needed. The Company considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, which included the results of operations for the current and preceding years. The Company also considered whether there was any currently available information about future years. As of September 30, 2023, in part because in the current year we achieved three years of cumulative pretax income, management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred taxes are realizable. It therefore released the valuation allowance accordingly. Under Internal Revenue Code 382, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since we became a loss corporation as defined in Section 382. Future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change . In addition, future equity offerings or acquisitions that have equity as a component of the purchase price could result in an ownership change. If an ownership change has occurred or does occur in the future, utilization of the NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes may be limited, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations for both federal taxes and the many states and local tax jurisdictions in which we operate or do business in. ASC 740 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. As of September 30, 2023, the Company's management carried out an evaluation as required by the Exchange Act of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were effective as of September 30, 2023. The evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting included a review of our objectives and processes, implementation by us and the effect on the information generated for use in this Annual Report. In the course of this evaluation and in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, we sought to identify material weaknesses in our controls, to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements, and to confirm that any necessary corrective action, including process improvements, were being undertaken. Our evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures is done quarterly and management reports the effectiveness of our controls and procedures in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our internal control over financial reporting is also evaluated on an ongoing basis by our executive management and by other individuals in our organization. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, and to make modifications as necessary. We periodically evaluate our processes and procedures and make improvements as required. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management applies its judgment in assessing the benefits of controls relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and (ii) information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2023. Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Based on the foregoing evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023. There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during fiscal 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(6) Lead independent Director Derek Dewan Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board Derek Dewan was appointed Chairman and CEO of General Employment Enterprises, Inc. (k/k/a GEE Group Inc.) (NYSE American: JOB) in 2015, following its merger with Scribe Solutions, Inc. He is a highly accomplished executive with a proven track record of success and outstanding leadership achievements. Throughout his career, he has demonstrated exceptional abilities in driving organic growth, executing strategic acquisitions, and delivering outstanding financial performance. With extensive experience in the staffing services industry, Mr. Dewan has consistently achieved remarkable results and established himself as a respected figure in the industry. Since 2015, Mr. Dewan has successfully led JOB through 5 strategic acquisitions, significant post-acquisition integration, the COVID-19 pandemic, significant deleveraging of JOB resulting in the elimination of approximately 120 million in debt, and a 57.5 million follow-on public equity offering. The results of these activities have been transformational, including transitioning JOB away from industrial staffing towards professional staffing led by IT, revenue growth of 3-4 times, significantly higher gross profit and earnings margins, consistent profitability and positive cash flow. Prior to this, Mr. Dewan served as Chairman and CEO of MPS Group, Inc., a publicly-traded staffing company. His tenure at MPS Group began in January 1994 when he joined AccuStaff Incorporated, MPS Group's predecessor, as President and Chief Executive Officer and led the IPO in August of that year. Notably, under Mr. Dewan's leadership, the company underwent significant organic growth and successfully executed over 100 strategic acquisitions, transforming it into a Fortune 1000 world-class, global multi-billion-dollar staffing services provider. MPS Group's expansion under Mr. Dewan's guidance extended its reach to include a vast network of offices across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Asia, and Australia. The company consistently achieved remarkable success during his tenure, marked by completed secondary stock offerings of 110 million and 370 million, inclusion in the Standard and Poor's (S P) Mid-Cap 400, and recognition on the Wall Street Journal's "top performing stock list" for three consecutive years. He led the company s growth from a microcap to one of the largest U.S. professional staffing firms with human resources solutions verticals in IT, accounting, legal, healthcare and engineering. Under his leadership, the premier software vendor management system VMS Beeline, and managed services provider MSP Pontoon, were developed. Mr. Dewan s final pivotal leadership achievement was the sale of MPS Group to Adecco Group in 2010, the largest staffing company in the world, for an impressive 1.3 billion. To our knowledge, this was the largest and most successful shareholder return story within the staffing industry at the time and still sets a high water mark today. This transaction exemplified Mr. Dewan s ability to navigate complex negotiations and deliver exceptional value to stakeholders. 40 Table of Contents Before his tenure at MPS Group, Mr. Dewan started his career as a CPA with Price Waterhouse and rapidly ascended to the manager level in less than five (5) years. Subsequently, he moved to Coopers Lybrand where he was promoted to the positions of Tax Partner in Charge and Managing Partner at that international accounting firm, now PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP PwC ). He was admitted as a partner at age 29, one of the youngest individuals to achieve this status in the history of the firm. This role provided him with a strong foundation in organizational leadership and excellence, operational and financial management, and expertise in tax and accounting practices, further enhancing his abilities as a strategic and effective business leader. Mr. Dewan's extensive experience, demonstrated success, and exceptional leadership skills make him a valuable asset to the Company. With a proven ability to drive growth, execute strategic initiatives, and achieve outstanding financial results, he is well-positioned to contribute to the continued success of GEE Group s future endeavors. He is a recipient of the Ellis Island Medal of Honor , the ATFL Joseph J. Jacobs Distinguished Achievement Award , the RMF Distinguished Lifetime Achievement Award and the USF Alumni Award for Entrepreneurship . He has served on the NYSE Listed Company Advisory Committee, the SMU Cox School of Business Executive Board, the University of South Florida School of Accountancy Advisory Council and the ALSAC Board which is the fund-raising arm of St. Jude Children s Research Hospital.

The Pay Versus Performance table is highly regulated and requires pay disclosure that is significantly different than what we have customarily provided in the Summary Compensation Table and the other executive compensation tables in prior years. The table currently provides SEC mandated compensation data for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 for our Named Executive Officers NEOs ), including our principal Executive Officer PEO ), along with certain financial performance measures. In reviewing the table, our shareholders should note the following: o The amounts in columns (b) and (d) of the table are taken from or derived directly from the total compensation paid to the relevant NEOs as reported in this year s or prior years Summary Compensation Tables o The compensation actually paid in columns (c) and (e) represents a new type of compensation disclosure mandated by the SEC, the intent of which is to try and isolate the amount of compensation earned by the relevant NEO(s) in each year. To calculate compensation actually paid, we are required to start with the totals for that year as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, deduct the Summary Compensation Table values for stock and option awards, and then add back amounts for new and previously outstanding stock and option awards in a manner mandated by the SEC. The disclosure and calculations are complex and can be confusing, and the amounts determined in accordance with the rules often bear no relation to the money or the economic value received or monetized by a particular NEO in the given year. We therefore caution that the term compensation actually paid should not be read literally and does not actually reflect the take home amounts received by our NEOs in a given year and o The SEC rules require that we include in the Pay Versus Performance table information regarding our U.S. GAAP net income results. U.S. GAAP net income was not a performance metric in any of our compensation programs and did not affect the compensation awarded to our NEOs for the years covered by the Pay Versus Performance Table. We are nonetheless required to include such information in the table and we urge our investors to keep in mind that U.S. GAAP net income did not drive the amount of pay awarded to or realized by our NEOs. 58 Table of Contents Pay Versus Performance Table (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) Name Fiscal Year Summary Compensation Table Total for PEO Compensation Actually Paid to PEO (1) Average Summary Compensation Table Total for Non -PEO NEOs Average Compensation Actually paid to Non-PEO NEOs (1) Value of Initial Fixed 100 Investment Based on Total Shareholder Return (2) Net Income available to Maiden Common Shareholder (in thousands) Derek Dewan 2023 802,153 687,277 - - 128 9,418 Chief Executive Officer 2022 851,550 894,050 - - 137 19,599 Alex Stuckey 2023 - - 530,777 448,534 128 9,418 Chief Operating Officer 2022 - - 519,988 571,155 137 19,599 Kim Thorpe 2023 - - 539,514 390,276 128 9,418 Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 2022 - - 561,363 667,780 137 19,599 (1) To calculate compensation actually paid, adjustments were made to the amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table for the applicable year.

Friedman was the predecessor to FORVIS, having served as the Company s independent registered public accounting firm since November 29, 2012 through the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, and first fiscal quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.

On at least an annual basis, the Audit Committee reviews fees billed for all services provided for the year to date, and it pre-approves additional services if necessary.

 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK
 
 job_ex41.htm EXHIBIT 4.1 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK The following summary of the terms of our common stock does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended Bylaws ), copies of which are on file with the SEC as exhibits to reports that were previously filed with the SEC and are incorporated by reference herein. General Our authorized capital stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, no par value, and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value. As of December 15, 2023, we had 114,900,455 and 109,092,402 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively, and 3,933,500 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of 1.18 per share, 1,645,694 shares of restricted stock units issuable upon vesting, and an aggregate of 7,520,806 additional shares of common stock, including 3,954,306 shares available for restricted stock grants and 3,566,500 shares available for stock option grants, reserved for issuance under our 2013 Amended and Restated Incentive Stock Plan. As of December 15, 2023, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding. The following summary of the rights of our common stock is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws, copies of which are filed as exhibits to this Form 10-K Voting Rights Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by the shareholders. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to cumulate their votes. Dividends and Liquidation Subject to limitations under applicable law and preferences that may apply to any outstanding shares of our preferred stock, holders of the common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared by the Board out of funds legally available therefor. In the event of the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision has been made for any preferred stock having preference over the common stock. Holders of shares of common stock, as such, have no conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights, and there are no redemption provisions applicable to the common stock. Rights and Preferences The common stock has no preemptive, conversion or other rights to subscribe for additional securities. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our common stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that we may designate and issue in the future. Fully Paid and Nonassessable All outstanding shares of our common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. Amended and Restated of Incorporation and Bylaws Provisions See Certain Provisions of Illinois Law and of the Company s Amended and Restated of Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws for a description of provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws which may have the effect of delaying changes in our control or management. 1 Transfer Agent and Registrar The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Continental Stock Transfer and Trust. Its address is 1 State Street, New York, NY 10004, Telephone No. 212-509-4000. Certain Provisions of Illinois Law and our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as Amended, and our Bylaws Illinois Takeover Statute We are subject to Section 11.75 of the IBCA, an anti-takeover statute. In general, Section 11.75 of the IBCA prohibits a publicly held Illinois corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years following the time the person became an interested shareholder, unless the business combination or the acquisition of shares that resulted in a shareholder becoming an interested shareholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested shareholder. Generally, an interested shareholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within three years prior to the determination of interested shareholder status did own) 15 or more of a corporation s voting stock. The existence of this provision would be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for our stock. The IBCA also permits the board of directors to consider the interests of constituencies of the corporation in addition to shareholders, including employees, suppliers, customers and the community, in response to unsolicited offers. Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws Provisions Provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire, control of our company by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise. These provisions may also make the removal of incumbent officers and directors more difficult. These provisions are intended to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of our company to first negotiate with us. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions may make it more difficult for shareholders to take specific corporate actions and could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control. In particular, our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide for the following: Special Meetings of Shareholders . Special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, our president, a majority of the members of the board of directors, or by one or more shareholders holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not less than 20 of the votes at the special meeting. Issuance of Undesignated Preferred Stock . Our board of directors is authorized to issue, without further action by the shareholders, up to 20,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the board of directors. We currently have (i) 160,000 shares designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, (ii) 5,950,000 shares of preferred stock designated as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and (iii) 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock designated as Series C 8 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock As of the date of this prospectus, we did not have any shares of preferred stock outstanding. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock enables our board of directors to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. Staggered Board of Directors . Our Amended and Restated By-Laws provides for a staggered board of directors. Our board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which shall serve for a term of three years, with only one class of directors being elected in each year. As a result, successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election. Advance Notice Provision for Shareholders Proposals . Our Amended and Restated By-Laws require advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our shareholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors. 2

 job_ex971.htm EXHIBIT 97.1 GEE GROUP INC. Clawback Policy This Clawback Policy (this Policy has been adopted by the Board of Directors (the Board of GEE Group Inc., an Illinois corporation (the Company in light of the effective date of October 2, 2023 (the Effective Date of the listing requirements adopted by the NYSE American NYSE in the form of Section 811 Erroneously Awarded Compensation Section 811 that implements the incentive-based compensation recovery requirements set forth in Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), as added by Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. This Policy shall be filed as an exhibit to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K pursuant to Item 601(b)(97) of Regulation S-K. I. Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation. In the event that following the Effective Date the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement that (i) corrects errors that are material to previously issued financial statements or (ii) corrects errors that are not material to previously issued financial statements but would result in a material misstatement if the error were recorded in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (either such event, a Triggering Event ), the Company will use reasonable efforts to recover, subject to the terms of this Policy, from any current or former Executive Officer of the Company who was paid or granted Incentive-Based Compensation on or after the Effective Date, all Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation. II. Exceptional Circumstances . Should the recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation be impractical due to either (i) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the policy exceeding the amount to be recovered or (ii) such recovery causing a broad-based retirement plan to fail to meet the tax-qualification requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a), then the Compensation Committee of the Board (or, in the absence of such a committee, the independent members of the Board) may determine not to pursue such recovery so long as the Company has made a reasonable attempt to effect such recovery and provided supporting documentation regarding such efforts to NYSE. 1. Definitions. For purposes of this Policy, the following terms have the meanings indicated, in addition to the other terms defined herein: (a) Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation means the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation paid or granted by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company to an Executive Officer on or after the Effective Date at a time when the Company was listed on NYSE or another national securities exchange in excess of what would have been paid or granted to that Executive Officer under the circumstances reflected by the accounting restatement, without regard to any taxes paid, in the reasonable judgement of the Board. (b) Financial Reporting Measures means the measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in the Company s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures, as well as the Company s stock price and total shareholder return. (c) Incentive-Based Compensation means, with respect to any Executive Officer, any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of any financial reporting measure. For purposes of clarity, equity awards that vest exclusively upon completion of a specified employment period, without any performance condition, and bonus awards that are discretionary or based on subjective goals or goals unrelated to financial reporting measures, do not constitute Incentive-Based Compensation. (d) Executive Officer means the Company s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. Executive officers of the Company s parent or subsidiary entities are deemed Executive Officers of the Company if they perform such policy-making functions for the Company. Policy-making function is not intended to include policy-making functions that are not significant. 2. Process. Following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, the Board, after considering the recommendations of the Compensation Committee of the Board, will review each Executive Officer s Incentive-Based Compensation and take prompt and reasonable action in accordance with this Policy to seek recovery of all Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation. There shall be no duplication of recovery under this Policy and any of 15 U.S.C. Section 7243 (Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) or Section 10D of the Exchange Act. 3. Interpretation of this Policy; Determinations by the Board. The Board may at any time in its sole discretion supplement or amend any provision of this Policy in any respect, repeal this Policy in whole or part or adopt a new policy relating to recovery of incentive-based compensation with such terms as the Board determines in its sole discretion to be appropriate. The Board has the exclusive power and authority to administer this Policy, including, without limitation, the right and power to interpret the provisions of this Policy and to make all determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of this Policy, including, without limitation, any determination as to (a) whether a Triggering Event has occurred; and (b) what constitutes Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation, which authority may be delegated to the Compensation Committee. All such actions, interpretations and determinations that are taken or made by the Board or the Compensation Committee in good faith will be final, conclusive and binding. 4. Limitation on Period for Recovery. The Board may seek recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation received in the three (3) completed fiscal years, and any transition period of less than nine months resulting from a change in the Company s fiscal year end during that period, preceding the earlier to occur of the (i) the date the Board, any committee thereof or an officer of the Company authorized to take such action, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement, and (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an accounting restatement due to the Company s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S. federal securities laws. For purposes of determining when any such Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation was received by any Executive Officer, Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed received in the fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the grant or payment of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. In the case of Incentive-Based Compensation related to stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an accounting restatement: (i) the amount must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon with the Incentive-Based Compensation was received, and (ii) the Company shall maintain documentation of that reasonable estimate and provide such to the NYSE. 5. Other Recoupment Rights ; No Indemnification . The Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Board may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require an Executive Officer to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company. The Company shall not indemnify any Executive Officer against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation. 6. Effective Date . This Policy shall be effective as of the date it is adopted by the Board and shall apply to Incentive-Based Compensation that is received (as determined pursuant to Section 811) on or after the Effective Date. 2
