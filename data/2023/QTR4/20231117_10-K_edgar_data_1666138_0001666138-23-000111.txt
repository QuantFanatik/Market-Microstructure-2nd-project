 In connection with acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, we may become subject to liabilities and required to issue additional debt or equity. 
 We may be unable to identify, acquire, close or integrate acquisition targets successfully 
 Regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses, create complexities in our supply chain and damage our reputation with customers. 
 Our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health. 
 Despite our indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantially more indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our indebtedness. 
 Increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our indebtedness and could reduce our profitability. 
 A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings, outlook or watch assigned to our indebtedness by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital. 
 The agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business.

PART I 

Item 1. Business 
 
 The following discussion of our business contains forward-looking statements, as discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below. Our business, operations and financial position are subject to various risks as set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors below. The following information should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and related notes and the Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Company Overview 
 
 Atkore Inc. (collectively with all its subsidiaries referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Atkore, the Company, we, us, and our was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 4, 2010. As of September 30, 2023, Atkore was the sole stockholder of Atkore International Holdings Inc. AIH ), which in turn was the sole stockholder of Atkore International, Inc. AII ). On December 28, 2022, AIH merged into AII, with AII being the surviving entity. Accordingly, Atkore is now the sole stockholder of AII. 
 
 We are a leading manufacturer of Electrical products primarily for the non-residential construction and renovation markets, as well as residential markets, and Safety Infrastructure products for the construction and industrial markets. The Electrical segment manufactures high quality products used in the construction of electrical power systems including conduit, cable, and installation accessories. This segment serves contractors in partnership with the electrical wholesale channel. The Safety Infrastructure segment designs and manufactures solutions including metal framing, mechanical pipe, perimeter security, and cable management for the protection and reliability of critical infrastructure. These solutions are marketed to contractors, original equipment manufacturers OEMs ), and end-users. We believe we hold #1 or #2 positions in the United States by net sales in the vast majority of our products. The quality of our products, strength of our brands, our scale and national presence provide what we believe to be a unique set of competitive advantages that position us for profitable growth. 
 
 Our mission is to be the customer s first choice by providing unmatched quality, delivery, and value based on sustainable excellence in strategy, people, and processes. 
 
 Our Products 
 
 Atkore is committed to providing our customers with a safe, sustainable, and innovative portfolio of high quality electrical, mechanical, safety, and infrastructure products and solutions. In total, we serve several end-markets, including new non-residential construction, maintenance, repair and remodel MR R ), residential, OEM, and international markets. 
 
 We continuously seek to improve our product offerings and develop innovative new products that meet the changing needs of our customers, which include industry trends toward digital design tools and labor saving solutions. The majority of Atkore products have Building Information Modeling BIM models available for our customers use. 
 
 Significant product categories within our Electrical segment include metal electrical conduit and fittings, plastic pipe conduit and fittings, electrical cable and flexible conduit, and international cable management systems, which are critical components of the electrical infrastructure for new construction and MR R markets. Significant product categories within our Safety Infrastructure segment include mechanical tube, metal framing fittings, construction services and perimeter security. Our metal framing products are used in the installation of electrical systems and various support structures, and our mechanical tube products can commonly be found in solar applications.

Atkore continues to invest to add capabilities and capacity to develop innovative products and solutions to make installation faster and easier. Recent examples of our innovation include the patented MC Glide Tuff armored cable, the winner of the EC M 2022 Product of the Year in the Wire Cable category, which facilitates faster and smoother pull through during installations; Eagle Basket, which quickly latches together; and Cellular Core Conduit, which bends easier than PVC conduit. 
 
 Customers 
 
 We are acutely aware of the importance of our equipment operating reliably, and we strive to deliver the safest, highest quality products. Our sales and marketing processes are primarily focused on serving our customers, including electrical, industrial and specialty distributors, who sell to contractors, and OEMs. We believe customers view Atkore as offering a strong value proposition based on our broad product offering, strong brands, short order cycle times, reliability and consistent product quality. For each of fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, approximately 90 , 91 , and 90 respectively, of our net sales were sold to customers located in the United States. Our net sales by geographic area were as follows: 
 Fiscal Year Ended (in millions) September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 United States 3,150 3,553 2,637 International 369 361 291 Total 3,519 3,914 2,928 
 
 Atkore has a well-established customer base, which includes many of the largest companies in their categories. In fiscal 2023, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 38 of net sales. For Fiscal 2023, one customer, Sonepar USA accounted for more than 10 of sales, for fiscal 2022 and 2021, no single customer accounted for more than 10 of sales. 
 
 Our customers include global electrical distributors (such as Consolidated Electrical Distributors, Inc., Graybar Electric Company, Rexel, Sonepar S.A. and Wesco International, Inc.), independent electrical distributors including super-regional electrical distributors (such as U.S. Electrical Services Inc., Crescent Electric Supply Co. and United Electric Supply Company, Inc.) and members of buying groups (such as Affiliated Distributors, Inc., IMARK Group, Inc. and STAFDA) as well as industrial distributors and big-box retailers. We also support alternative energy OEMs, with many applications used in solar system infrastructure. 
 
 Manufacturing 
 
 We currently manufacture products in 49 facilities and operate a total footprint of approximately 7.5 million square feet of manufacturing and distribution space in eight countries. Our headquarters are located in Harvey, Illinois, which is also the location of our largest manufacturing facility. Similar to our distribution footprint, our manufacturing footprint is currently concentrated in the United States, with additional facilities in Australia, Belgium, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. 
 
 With respect to our tube and conduit products, we believe we are a technology leader in the in-line galvanizing manufacturing process and have developed specialized equipment that enables us to produce a variety of low-cost high-quality galvanized tube products. For example, our subsidiary, Allied Tube Conduit Corporation, or Allied Tube, developed an in-line galvanizing technique (Flo-Coat) in which zinc is applied in a continuous process when the tube and pipe are formed. The Flo-Coat galvanizing process provides superior zinc coverage of fabricated metal products for rust prevention and lower cost manufacturing than traditional hot-dip galvanizing. Another example is our Cellular Core conduit, which employs a co-extrusion process to create three firmly bonded layers with the inner layer as a cellular core, creating a conduit that weighs less and is more flexible while meeting UL standards.

Suppliers and Raw Materials 
 
 We use a variety of raw materials in manufacturing our products. Our primary raw materials are steel, copper and polyvinyl chloride PVC resin. We believe that sources for these raw materials are well-established, generally available and are in sufficient quantity that we may avoid disruption to our business if we encounter an interruption from one of our existing suppliers. Our primary suppliers of steel are Cleveland-Cliffs, Steel Dynamics and Nucor; our primary suppliers of copper are AmRod, SDI LaFarga and Nexans; and our primary suppliers of PVC resin are Westlake, Formosa and Oxy Vinyls; and our primary suppliers of HDPE resin are LyondellBasell and Baystar. We strive to maintain strong relationships with our suppliers. 
 
 Responsible sourcing and supply chain management are critical to Atkore s ability to provide high quality products to our customers. We expect our suppliers to carry out Atkore s values and commitments by using resources responsibly, reducing the environmental footprint of their operations whenever possible, and upholding fair employment and human rights principles as outlined in our Supplier Integrity and Sustainability Standards. 
 
 Distribution 
 
 Atkore adds value to the customer experience with a comprehensive portfolio of electrical products and strategically located regional service centers. Additionally, we drive value for our customers through a single order across our broad product portfolio coupled with services like our ReliaRoutes hub-and-spoke fixed trucking lanes and technologies like our mobile app to track orders and schedule pickups. 
 
 We primarily sell and distribute our products through electrical, industrial and specialty distributors and OEMs. For many of the more than 13,000 electrical-distributor branches in the United States, our products are must-stock lines that form a staple of their business. We serve a diverse group of end markets, including new construction, MR R and infrastructure, diversified industrials, alternative power generation, healthcare, data centers and government. End-users, who are typically electrical, industrial and mechanical contractors as well as OEMs, install our products during non-residential, residential and infrastructure construction and renovation projects or in assembly and manufacturing processes. 
 
 Distribution-based sales accounted for approximately 83 of our net sales in fiscal 2023. We distribute our products to electrical and industrial distributors from our manufacturing and distribution facilities as well as from over 38 dedicated distribution facilities operated by our agents. Our products are also stocked by electrical and industrial distributors who are located across the United States. Some of our products are purchased by OEMs and used as part of their products and solutions in applications such as utility solar framing, and conveyor systems. OEM sales accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales for fiscal 2023. 
 
 Our distribution footprint is concentrated in North America (the United States and Canada), with additional facilities in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 In a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Weather can impact the ability to pursue non-residential construction projects at any time of the year in any geography, but historically, our slowest quarters have been the first and second fiscal quarters of each fiscal year when frozen ground and cold temperatures in many parts of the country can impede the start and pursuit of construction projects. Sales of our products have historically been higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather and longer daylight conditions during these periods. Seasonal variations in operating results may also be significantly impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay construction projects. 
 
 Marketing 
 
 Our marketing efforts are focused on key stakeholder audiences including electrical and industrial distributors, contractors, engineers, government entities, and OEM customers. These combined efforts 
 6 

communicate the value proposition of the overall Atkore brand by bringing together complementary solutions in our portfolio while reinforcing the individual value propositions of our leading sub-brands such as Allied Tube Conduit, AFC Cable Systems, Kaf-Tech, Heritage Plastics, Unistrut, Power-Strut, Cope, US Tray, FRE Composites, United Poly Systems, Calbond and Calpipe. 
 
 Atkore sales are enabled through external commissioned sales agents and internal sales teams that drive customer acquisition and retention. Our comprehensive portfolio of products and solutions is continually enhanced by driving innovation into our markets with new product introductions, such as the digital tools that support project design and selection. 
 
 Prompted by evolving customer needs in an increasingly competitive, cost-and-efficiency conscious construction industry, we refreshed our branding strategy in 2020 from a house of brands to a branded house, uniting all brands under one master brand, Atkore, and adopted the Building Better Together theme to demonstrate how we work with our customers and our customers customers. An indicator of the effectiveness of our marketing and branding strategy is the marketplace recognition Atkore has garnered through several awards in the last 2 years, including the tED Best of the Best Award for Marketing Excellence, an AD Electrical Marketing Excellence Award, and a tED Advertising Award. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Our principal competitors range from national manufacturers to smaller regional manufacturers and differ by each of our product lines. We also face competition from manufacturers in Canada, Mexico and several other international markets, depending on the product. We believe our customers purchase from us because we provide value through the quality of our products, the breadth of our portfolio and the timeliness of our delivery. Competitive pressures are generally in the areas of product offering, product innovation, quality, service and price. 
 
 The main competitors in each of these segments are listed below: 
 
 Electrical: Zekelman Industries, Inc., Mitsubishi Corporation, Nucor Corporation, Southwire Company, LLC, Dura-Line Corporation, and Encore Wire Corporation plc. 
 
 Safety Infrastructure : Zekelman Industries, Inc., Eaton Corporation plc, ABB Ltd., Hubbell Incorporated, nVent Electric plc., and Haydon Corporation 
 
 Management of Information Technology Systems 
 
 Historically, information technology has not been a significant differentiator for us in our markets, however, we believe that the ease of doing business with us will become increasingly important to our growth and are making significant investments to improve our operations and provide valuable solutions for our customers. Over the past six years, Atkore has made significant investments in technology to improve our business and provide value to our customers. 
 
 Currently, we operate our business using commercially available hardware and software products with well-developed support services. These commercially available software products include the Company s general ledger and financial reporting system. The Company s email service and various other information technology services are on cloud computing platforms hosted by various prominent and reputable technology companies. Beginning in 2019, the Company began to standardize its ERP and has completed the implementation of modules for order management, advanced warehouse management, inventory management, accounts receivable and accounts payable across significant portions of the business. The Company continues to implement this ERP as it integrates acquired businesses. 
 
 In today s business environment, cybersecurity is of paramount importance and Atkore has also invested significantly to strengthen our cybersecurity posture.

Human Capital Resources 
 
 Culture 
 
 Atkore believes that a culture of engagement and alignment drives continuous improvement, enhances our customers experience, and delivers strong performance. 
 
 We aim to foster a workplace where our employees feel aligned with our mission, proud of our culture and engaged in their work. Our annual Employee Engagement and Alignment Survey is one of our primary tools to assess our performance as an employer of choice and to measure employee engagement and satisfaction. 
 
 Atkore operates under a set of core values of Accountability, Teamwork, Integrity, Respect and Excellence and the Atkore Business System, which prioritizes Strategy, People and Processes, the fundamentals of how we Build Better Together. Our culture provides employees with opportunities for personal and professional development as well as community engagement, all of which contribute to our Company s overall success. In addition to many other awards, in 2023, Atkore was recognized as a Great Place to Work-Certified TM company for the third year in a row. 
 
 Employee Base 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, we employed approximately 5,600 full-time equivalent employees of whom approximately 14 are temporary or contract workers. Our employees are primarily located in the United States, with about 14 employed at our international locations in Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, approximately 18 of our domestic and international employees were represented by a union under a collective bargaining agreement. All unions are either located in the United States or Canada with no unions or Worker s Councils at any of our other locations abroad. 
 
 From time to time, our collective bargaining agreements expire and come up for re-negotiations. On July 14, 2020, the Company and the United Steelworkers Union, representing approximately 350 employees, reached an agreement on the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement for our largest facility in Harvey, Illinois, which expires in April 2024. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. 
 
 From time to time, our collective bargaining agreements expire and come up for re-negotiations. Our collective bargaining agreement with the Teamsters for our New Bedford, Massachusetts facility involving a bargaining unit of 194 employees expired in February 2023, and we successfully negotiated a new agreement, which now expires in February 2028. Our Harvey, Illinois Special Metal Processing Facility agreement with the United Steelworkers Union, involving a bargaining unit of 20 employees, expired in November 2022, and we successfully negotiated a new agreement, which now expires in November 2025. Our Unistrut Construction agreement with the Southern Region Carpenters Union, involving a bargaining unit of 27 employees, expired in November 2022, and we successfully negotiated a new agreement, which now expires in November 2025.

We believe our relationship with our employees is good. 
 
 Safety, Health and Well-Being 
 
 At Atkore, nothing is more important than the safety and well-being of our people. We seek to ensure that employees, customers, contractors, and visitors to our facilities go home safely at the end of each day, and we empower everyone to proactively identify and eliminate risks to promote an injury-free and incident-free workplace. 
 
 In 2021, we launched our new safety brand Let s Make It Home, a safety program encompassing our commitment to safety and reinforcing the importance of living our values in order to create a workplace where everyone feels respected, appreciated and safe. Developed by and for employees, Let s Make It Home makes safety at Atkore personal and reminds everyone that safety is integral to every action. 
 
 In 2021, we also introduced updates to our Life Saving Rules, which provide additional guidance on the actions every employee must take to ensure safe practices across our operations. All employees are 
 8 

required to certify compliance with the Life Saving Rules annually. Additionally, our employees are required to receive Atkore Kore Training and Safety Alerts, which cover high-hazard occupational safety concerns and compliance with both internal and external safety and environmental permits. Every one of our sites completes a self-assessment and certification of completion. 
 
 We believe Atkore s investments in safety, health and well-being are critical to supporting and protecting our most important asset: our people. 
 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 
 At Atkore, we believe that diversity of all types contributes to our success and that our differences make us better. We believe that supporting a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace fosters a culture of openness and innovation. Our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion DE I is embedded throughout the company with a range of programs driven by our DE I Roadmap, which helps us identify and execute specific actions and monitor our progress toward a workplace where all employees feel they belong and are empowered to do their best work. 
 
 In 2023, we expanded the scope DEI related training offerings, building upon our required unconscious bias training for salaried and hourly employees and reflecting our ambition to embed equity and inclusion across our business. In 2022, we also expanded our anti-harassment policy to expressly prohibit bullying, in addition to discrimination and all forms of harassment, and all Atkore employees are required to complete anti-harassment training. Our DEI Steering Committee sponsored a number of community events and contributions in 2023, including back-to-school backpack drives for lower social-economic communities, and engagement with a variety of LGBTQIA+ community organizations, including as a sponsor for the Center on Halsted's annual gala and career fair in Chicago, Illinois. 
 
 We regularly evaluate our progress on DE I across the company. Our longstanding DE I Steering Committee leads many of our programs and internal efforts, evaluating how we can continue to improve and create a more inclusive culture. Each employee is encouraged to bring their uniqueness to the Company, which unlocks their individual potential and Atkore s organizational potential. 
 
 Talent Development and Retention 
 
 Our ability to successfully operate, grow and implement key business strategies is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees at all levels of our Company. As part of our human capital resource objectives, we support our employees by using strategic workforce planning to forecast future needs, building, and leveraging an inclusive leadership mindset, and applying a robust talent management process, including our onboarding and immersion program and our monthly organizational leadership review cadence. 
 
 We provide opportunities for advancement through rotational and stretch assignments and best practice leadership roles. In fiscal 2023, approximately 22 of our total positions filled came from internal promotions, highlighting our commitment to developing our employees. 
 
 The Company rewards employees with competitive compensation and benefits packages, including attractive medical plans, retirement plans, opportunities for annual bonuses and, for eligible employees, long-term incentives and equity-based compensation. The Company believes our compensation program allows us to attract and retain talented employees. 
 
 Engagement and Alignment 
 
 We have a culture of engagement and alignment and believe fully engaged employees stay focused on being a standout leader, support the decisions of the leadership team and strive for breakthrough results. An aligned employee lives our mission and values, learns our strategic priorities and links their individual goals to those priorities. Our 2023 engagement and alignment survey had an overall participation rate of 81 . In fiscal 2023, 72 of our hourly workforce participated in the survey, compared to 67 of hourly employees in fiscal 2022. The result of the survey showed the following favorable percentages: Engagement 83 ; Alignment 87 ; Safety 91 ; and Diversity Equity Inclusion 84 . 
 
 Human Rights 
 
 Atkore is committed to supporting human rights and fair labor practices. We will not tolerate human rights abuses of any kind, including human trafficking, child labor or incidents of corruption within our 
 9 

company or supply chain. Employees are encouraged to report any potential violations or concerns, and all reports are promptly and impartially investigated. 
 
 Our Human Rights Policy defines our dedication to protecting human rights and is driven by our core values and is aligned with national and international principles of human rights. In fiscal 2023, we launched Human Trafficking Awareness and Prevention training for all salaried employees. 
 
 Atkore s Supplier Integrity and Sustainability Standards set forth our expectation that suppliers uphold our commitment to human rights. In 2021, we launched our Supplier Business Review Agenda with several of our largest suppliers to ensure our partners could conduct business in alignment with our values. 
 
 Intellectual Property 
 
 Patents and other proprietary rights can be important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We periodically review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, in an effort to avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others. 
 
 We own a portfolio of patents and trademarks. Other than licenses to commercially available third-party software, we do not believe that any of our licenses to third-party intellectual property are material to our business taken as a whole. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. We rely on both trademark registration and common law protection for trademarks. Trademark rights may potentially extend indefinitely and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks. 
 
 While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our competitive position is dependent on patent or trademark protection or that our operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. We nevertheless face intellectual property-related risks. For more information on these risks, see Item 1A, Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights in foreign countries, and we may become involved in intellectual property disputes. 
 
 Regulatory Matters 
 
 Our facilities are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. regulations including the protection of human health, safety and the environment. Among other things, these laws govern the use, storage, treatment, transportation, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes; regulate emissions or discharges of pollutants or other substances into the air, water, or otherwise into the environment; impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances and protect the health and safety of our employees. 
 
 We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, capital expenditures in addition to ordinary course costs to comply with applicable current and future environmental, health and safety laws, such as those governing air emissions and wastewater discharges. In addition, government agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in our environmental permits which increase our costs. These laws are subject to change, which can be frequent and material. More stringent federal, state or local environmental rules or regulations could increase our operating costs and expenses. 
 
 The cost of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and capital expenditures required to meet regulatory requirements is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or competitive position.

In October 2013, the State of Illinois filed a complaint against our subsidiary Allied Tube, alleging violations of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act, or the IEPA, relating to discharges to a storm sewer system that terminates at Allied Tube s Harvey, Illinois manufacturing facility. The State sought an injunction ordering Allied Tube to take immediate corrective action to abate the alleged violations and civil penalties as permitted by applicable law. Allied Tube has reviewed management practices and made improvements to its diesel fuel storage and truck maintenance areas to resolve the State s claims. We entered into a consent order that required Allied Tube to pay a nominal penalty, install base low-flow oil and water separation equipment and take certain additional remedial actions to resolve the State s claim. The installation of the low-flow oil and water separation equipment is complete; however, the State is now requiring additional remedial investigation and remediation activities before considering a no further action determination and it has extended the deadline to perform all such activity through December 2025. We do not currently expect that any remaining obligations would have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 In August 2014, we received from the IEPA the terms of a proposed new stormwater discharge permit for our Harvey, Illinois manufacturing facility. Because the facility did not meet the zinc limit set forth in the proposed permit, the Company commenced negotiations with the IEPA to agree upon mutually acceptable discharge limits. During these negotiations, the facility was operating under an extension of the terms of our existing stormwater discharge permit. In October 2016, we received the final permit. A mutually agreed upon compliance plan was part of the permit. The compliance plan included studies to reduce zinc emitted from galvanizing manufacturing operations, implementation of more rigorous discharge management practices, evaluation of the installation of passive/cost effective stormwater treatment and receiving stream studies to determine if a less stringent permit limit would be as protective of the water system as the October 2016 permit limit. The permit was modified in December 2019 to accommodate trials of a metal coating technology that would nearly eliminate the largest source of zinc emissions from our galvanizing operations. Although the metal coating trials were not successful, we have completed the installation of zinc treatment systems for the storm water discharges, are further reducing the zinc emitted from the galvanizing manufacturing operations and are capturing stormwater for treatment and use in our manufacturing process. A new permit was issued August 5, 2021 that included a less stringent permit limit based on the receiving stream evaluation, which also included a one-year start-up / shake-down period to meet the new zinc limit. We continued to keep the IPEA informed on our progress. The facility achieved intermittent compliance during the one-year start-up / shake-down period and throughout the remainder of 2022, and into 2023. Discussions were held with the IEPA regarding the zinc translator constant and the mixing zone study over the summer. Based on the updated stormwater calculations, the IEPA has agreed to a less-stringent permit limit for zinc (1.84 mg/L vs 1.15 mg/L). Ongoing compliance with the stormwater discharge permit is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 We are continually investigating, remediating or addressing contamination at our current and former facilities. For example, we are currently monitoring and passively remediating groundwater contamination at our Wayne, Michigan facility. Future remediation activities may be required to address contamination at or migrating from the Wayne, Michigan site. We have maintained good working relationships with the State of Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, Energy, the City of Wayne and the residents surrounding our facility. We hold periodic public meetings to keep the community apprised of the current monitoring data and the remedial efforts taken or planned. We do not expect planned remedial efforts to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Many of our current and former facilities have a history of industrial usage for which additional investigation and remediation obligations could arise in the future and which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 You should carefully consider the factors described below, in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors are important to understanding the contents of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and of other reports. Our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones relevant to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely impact our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Risks Related to Our Business 
 
 Our performance may be impacted by general business and economic conditions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 The success of our business is affected by a number of general business and economic conditions. Our primary end markets are new non-residential construction, MR R, residential, OEM, and international markets. Decrease in global economic activity may result in downturns or periods of economic weakness in our primary end markets. Such decreases may be instigated by factors beyond our control, including economic recessions, fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, supply chain disruptions, inflation, availability of raw materials and other items sourced for production and delivery of finished product, changes in end-user preferences, consumer confidence, public health conditions, including epidemics or pandemics, availability of credit, business office usage and changes in the fiscal or monetary policies of governments in the regions in which we operate. In turn, we may experience diminished demand for our products, which could create excess capacity and reduce the prices which we are able to charge for our products. The materialization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 During the United States economic recession which began in the second half of 2007 and continued through June of 2009, demand for our products declined significantly. Another economic downturn in any of the markets we serve may result in a reduction of sales and pricing for our products. Any such economic downturn could also adversely affect the creditworthiness of our customers. If the creditworthiness of our customers declines, we could face increased credit risk and some, or many, of our customers may not be able to pay us amounts when they become due. Economic downturns may also result in restructuring actions and associated expenses and the impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles. In particular, we may be forced to close underperforming facilities. Any such restructuring actions, combined with reduced demand and excess capacity, could negatively impact our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 We cannot predict economic conditions, or the timing or strength of demand in our markets. Weakness in the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 12 

The non-residential construction industry accounts for a significant portion of our business, and a downturn in the non-residential construction industry could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Our business is largely dependent on the non-residential construction industry. For new construction, we estimate that our product installation typically lags United States non-residential starts by six to twelve months. The United States non-residential construction industry is cyclical, with product demand based on numerous factors such as availability of credit, interest rates, general economic conditions, consumer confidence and other factors that are beyond our control. United States non-residential construction starts, as reported by Dodge, reached a historic low of 690 million square feet in our fiscal 2010 and increased to 1,468 million square feet in our fiscal 2023, which was above historical average levels. 
 
 From time to time we have been adversely affected in various parts of the country by declines in non-residential building construction starts due to, among other things, supply chain disruptions and availability of construction labor and materials, changes in tax laws affecting the real estate industry, interest rate increases, governmental restrictions relating to public health conditions and business office usage. Continued uncertainty about current economic conditions will continue to pose a risk to our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, as participants in this industry may postpone spending in response to negative financial news or declines in income or asset values, which could have a continued material negative effect on the demand for our products. 

The raw materials on which we depend in our production process may be subject to price increases which we may not be able to pass through to our customers, or to price decreases which may decrease the prices of our products. As a result, such price fluctuations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Our results of operations are impacted by changes in commodity prices, primarily steel, copper and resin. Historically, we have not engaged in material hedging strategies for raw material purchases. Substantially all of the products we sell (such as steel conduit, tubing and framing, copper wiring in our cables, and PVC and HDPE conduit) are subject to price fluctuations because they are composed primarily of steel, copper or resin, industrial commodities that are subject to price volatility. This volatility can significantly affect our gross profit. We also watch the market trends of certain other commodities, such as zinc (used in the galvanization process for a number of our products), electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel, as such commodities can be important to us as they impact our cost of sales, both directly through our plant operations and indirectly through transportation and freight expense. 
 
 We may not always be completely successful in managing raw material market fluctuations in the future. We generally sell our products on a spot basis (and not under long-term contracts). Accordingly, in periods of declining raw material prices, we may face pricing pressure from our customers to reduce our products prices. Conversely, in periods of increasing raw material prices, we may not be able to pass on such increases to our customers. Our inability to maintain established price levels in an environment of declining raw material prices, or offset increasing raw material prices by our products prices, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 We operate in a competitive landscape, and increased competition could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 The principal markets that we serve are highly competitive. Competition is based primarily on product offering, product innovation, quality, service and price. Our principal competitors range from national manufacturers to smaller regional manufacturers and differ by each of our product lines. See Item 1, Business Competition. Some of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do and some may have more established brand names in the markets we serve. The actions of our competitors, including adding production capacity and the expansion of imported products, may encourage us to lower our prices or to offer additional services or enhanced products at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our gross profit, net income or cash flows or may cause us to lose market share. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 13 

Our operating results are sensitive to the availability and cost of freight and energy, which are important in the manufacture and transport of our products. 
 
 We are dependent on third-party freight carriers to transport many of our products. Our access to third-party freight carriers is not guaranteed, and we may be unable to transport our products at economically attractive rates in certain circumstances, particularly in cases of adverse market conditions or disruptions to transportation infrastructure. Our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to pass all of the cost increases on to our customers, if we are unable to obtain the necessary energy supplies or if freight carrier capacity in our geographic markets were to decline significantly or otherwise become unavailable. 
 
 Interruptions in the proper functioning of our information technology IT systems and the IT systems of those with whom we do business, including from cybersecurity threats, could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs or decreases in revenues, or both. 
 
 We use our IT systems to, among other things, run and manage our manufacturing operations, manage inventories and accounts receivable, make purchasing decisions and monitor our results of operations, and process, transmit and store sensitive electronic data, including employee, supplier and customer records. As a result, the proper functioning of our IT systems is critical to the successful operation of our business. Our information systems include proprietary systems developed and maintained by us. In addition, we depend on IT systems of third parties, such as suppliers, retailers and OEMs to, among other things, market and distribute our products, develop new products and services, operate our website, host and manage our services, store data, process transactions, respond to customer inquiries and manage inventory and our supply chain. Although our IT systems are protected through physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities exist, our IT systems or those of third parties whom we depend upon are still vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, unauthorized access, telecommunication failures and other problems. If critical proprietary or third-party IT systems fail or are otherwise unavailable, including as a result of system upgrades and transitions, our ability to manufacture, process orders, track credit risk, identify business opportunities, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, pay expenses and otherwise manage our business would be adversely affected. 
 
 Our business is also vulnerable to cyberattacks. Cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and more frequent and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data (either directly or through our vendors) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, denial of service attacks, phishing, untargeted but sophisticated and automated attacks and other disruptive software campaigns. We have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to potential damage from cybersecurity attacks. Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure or those of our third parties may be vulnerable to such cyber incidents. The result of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, disrupted operations, misstated or misappropriated financial data, theft of our intellectual property or other confidential information (including of our customers, suppliers and employees), liability for stolen assets or information, increased cyber security protection costs and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence. In addition, if any information about our customers, including payment information, were the subject of a successful cybersecurity attack against us, we could be subject to litigation or other claims by the affected customers. We have incurred costs and may incur significant additional costs in order to implement the security measures we feel are appropriate to protect our IT systems. 
 
 When the networks of our business partners are comprised, this also raises risks regarding payments and orders. 

14 

Our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by the importation of similar products into the United States, as well as U.S. trade policy and practices. 
 
 A substantial portion of our revenue is generated through our operations in the United States. Imports of products similar to those manufactured by us may reduce the volume of products sold by domestic producers and depress the selling prices of our products and those of our competitors. 
 
 We believe import levels are affected by, among other things, overall worldwide product demand, the trade practices of the U.S. and foreign governments, the cost of freight, the challenges involved in shipping, government subsidies to foreign producers and governmentally imposed trade restrictions, such as quotas, tariffs, other trade barriers in the United States and government enforcement of such quotas, tariffs and trade barriers. Increased imports of products similar to those manufactured by us in the United States could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 We are directly and indirectly subject to legislative and regulatory changes that may affect demand for our products. 
 
 The markets for certain of our products are influenced by federal, state, local and international governmental regulations, trade policies and trade groups (such as the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, the inflation Reduction Act of 2022, other infrastructure legislation, Buy America regulations, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Underwriters Laboratories, National Electrical Code and American Society of Mechanical Engineers) as well as other policies, including those imposed on the non-residential construction industry (such as the National Electrical Code and corresponding state and local laws based on the National Electrical Code). These regulations and policies are subject to change. Any changes to such regulations, laws and policies could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Specifically, changes to the National Electrical Code and any similar state, local or non-U.S. laws, including changes that would allow for alternative products to be used in the non-residential construction industry or that would render less restrictive or otherwise reduce the current requirements under such laws and regulations, could expand the scope of products which could serve as alternatives to our products. As a result, competition in the industries in which we operate could increase, with a potential corresponding decrease in the demand for our products. To remain competitive, we may be forced to reduce the prices of our products. 
 
 In addition, in the event that changes in such laws would render current requirements more restrictive, we may be required to change our products or production processes to meet such increased restrictions, which could result in increased costs and cause us to lose market share. 
 
 The materialization of any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Our results of operations could be adversely affected by weather. 
 
 Although weather patterns affect our operating results throughout the year, adverse weather historically has reduced construction activity in our first and second fiscal quarters as construction activity declines due to inclement weather, frozen ground and shorter daylight hours. In contrast, our highest volume of net sales historically has occurred in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. If hurricanes, severe storms, floods, other natural disasters or similar events occur in the geographic regions in which we or our suppliers operate or through which deliveries must travel, our results of operations may be adversely affected. 

15 

We have incurred and continue to incur significant costs to comply with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, and our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental and health and safety laws liability. 
 
 We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental laws governing, among other things, the generation, use, storage, treatment, transportation, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes, emissions or discharges of pollutants or other substances into the environment, investigation and remediation of, and damages resulting from, releases of hazardous substances. 
 
 Our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties, enforcement actions, and regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures such as the installation of pollution control equipment, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Accordingly, compliance with these laws, regulations, permits and approvals is a significant factor in our business. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, capital expenditures in addition to ordinary course costs to comply with applicable current and future environmental laws, such as those governing air emissions and wastewater discharges. These laws are subject to change, which could be frequent and material. The imposition of more stringent federal, state or local environmental rules or regulations could increase our operating costs and expenses. In addition, government agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in our environmental permits which increase our costs. 
 
 From time to time, we may be held liable for the costs to address contamination at any real property we have ever owned, operated or used in our business activities or as a disposal site. We are currently, and may in the future be, required to investigate, remediate or otherwise address contamination at our current or former facilities. Many of our current and former facilities have a history of industrial usage for which additional investigation, remediation or other obligations could arise in the future and that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For example, as we sell, close or otherwise dispose of facilities, we may need to address environmental issues at such sites, including any previously unknown contamination. 
 
 We could be subject to third-party claims for property damage and nuisance or otherwise as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws or in connection with releases of hazardous or other materials at any current or former facility. We could also be subject to environmental indemnification or other claims in connection with assets and businesses that we have divested. 
 
 We are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign requirements concerning health and safety conditions at our manufacturing facilities, including those promulgated by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA ). The operation of manufacturing facilities involves many risks, including the failure or substandard performance of equipment, suspension of operations and new governmental statues, regulations, guidelines and policies. Our and our customers operations are also subject to various hazards incidental to the production, use, handling, processing, storage and transportation of certain hazardous materials. These hazards can cause personal injury, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage. Furthermore, we may become subject to claims with respect to workplace exposure, personal injury, workers compensation and other matters. We may be subject to material financial penalties or liabilities for noncompliance with health and safety requirements, as well as potential business disruption, if any of our facilities or a portion of any facility is required to be temporarily closed as a result of any significant injury or any noncompliance with applicable requirements. Moreover, we have sustained capital expenditure in complying with applicable health and safety laws and regulations, and any changes to such laws and regulations could increase our costs of operations. 
 
 16 

We cannot assure you that any costs relating to future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, as well as costs to address contamination or environmental claims, will not exceed any current estimates or adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Any unanticipated liabilities or obligations arising, for example, out of discovery of previously unknown conditions or changes in law or enforcement policies, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 We rely on several customers for a significant portion of our net sales, and the loss of such customers, or their inability or unwillingness to pay our invoices on time could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Certain of our customers, in particular buying groups representing consortia of independent electrical distributors, national electrical distributors, OEMs and data center, medical center and global mega manufacturing project general contractors are material to our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows because they account for a significant portion of our net sales. In fiscal 2023, our ten largest customers (including buyers and distributors in buying groups) accounted for approximately 38 of our net sales. Our percentage of sales to our major customers may increase if we are successful in our strategy of expanding the range of products which we sell to existing customers. In such an event, or in the event of any consolidation in certain segments we serve, including retailers selling building products, our sales may be increasingly sensitive to deterioration in the financial condition of, or other adverse developments with respect to, one or more of our top customers. Our top customers may also be able to exert influences on us with respect to pricing, delivery, payment or other terms. Any termination of a business relationship with, or a significant sustained reduction in business received from, one or more of our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 The majority of our net sales are facilitated through the extension of credit to our customers, and a significant asset included in our working capital is accounts receivable from customers. As of September 30, 2023, Sonepar USA represented 14 and CED National represented 11 of the Company s accounts receivable, with no significant amounts past due. As of September 30, 2022, one customer, CED National represented 10 of the Company s accounts receivable, with no significant amounts past due. For fiscal 2023, one customer, Sonepar USA accounted for more than 10 of sales, for fiscal 2022 and 2021, no single customer accounted for more than 10 of sales. See Note 17, Segment Information to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. If customers responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products and services, or become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Our working capital requirements could result in us having lower cash available for, among other things, capital expenditures and acquisition financing. 
 
 Our working capital needs fluctuate based on economic activity and the market prices for our main raw materials, which are predominantly steel, copper and PVC resin. We require significant working capital to purchase these raw materials and sell our products efficiently and profitably to our customers. Our cash collection cycle is generally one to two months longer than our cash payment cycle. If our working capital requirements increase and we are unable to finance our working capital on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may not be able to obtain raw materials to respond to customer demand, which could result in a loss of sales. 
 
 If our working capital needs increase, the amount of liquidity we have at our disposal to devote to other uses will decrease. A decrease in liquidity could, among other things, limit our flexibility, including our ability to make capital expenditures and to complete acquisitions that we have identified, thereby materially and adversely affecting our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

17 

Widespread public health conditions including pandemics could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 While we have implemented risk management and contingency plans and taken preventive measures and other precautions, no predictions of specific scenarios can be made with respect to any future pandemic and such measures may not adequately protect our business from the impact of such events. These impacts include disruptions or restrictions on our employees ability to work in proximity to others or even to travel to or for work, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers, suppliers and other constituents of our supply chain. 
 
 Uncertainty and delays in our end-markets relating to public health conditions could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products, some jurisdictions may raise taxes to help cover pandemic-related costs and disruptions to or adverse conditions in the financial industry could affect our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all. 
 
 Climate change, and the regulatory and legislative developments related to climate change, may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 
 The potential physical impacts of climate change on our business operations are highly uncertain and differ in each geographic region where we operate. These impacts may include changes in weather patterns and increased weather intensity, water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperatures. The impacts of climate change may materially and adversely impact the ability to produce, cost of production, insurance availability, and financial performance of our operations. Further, any impacts to our business and financial condition as a result of climate change are likely to occur over a sustained period of time and are therefore difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. For example, extreme weather events may result in adverse physical effects on portions of our or others infrastructure, which could disrupt our supply chain and our customers and ultimately our business operations. In addition, disruption of transportation and distribution systems could result in reduced operational efficiency and customer service interruption. Climate-related events have the potential to disrupt our business, including the business of our suppliers and customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, and additional costs to resume operations. 
 
 Labor disputes, increased labor costs or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations and impair our financial performance. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, approximately 18 of our domestic and international employees were represented with a collective bargaining agreement by labor unions. Several collective bargaining agreements to which the Company is a party, including the agreement covering the Company s production in Harvey, Illinois, will expire in 2024. Work stoppages or production interruptions could occur at our facilities or our suppliers facilities. Such disputes may arise under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements, as a result of supplier financial distress or for other reasons. Any amendments to existing collective bargaining agreements, or the implementation of new collective bargaining agreements, could result in increased labor costs. 
 
 Any organizing efforts, significant work stoppages or increases in labor costs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Item 1, Business Human Capital Resources. 
 
 Our business requires skilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees. 
 
 The Company s success is dependent on our employees, so it s critical that we continue to attract and retain talent. To accomplish this, the Company needs to offer a total rewards package that includes competitive benefits and pay, reflecting our long-term commitment to the well-being of our employees. Efforts to attract talent to fill open roles in light of recent constrained labor availability may take more time than in the past and may cost the Company significantly more than in recent years. Moreover, the constrained labor conditions may mean that retention of existing talent may require significant additional pay and incentives.

We have financial obligations relating to pension plans that we maintain in the United States. 
 
 We provide pension benefits through a number of noncontributory and contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering eligible United States employees. As of September 30, 2023, we estimated that our pension plans were overfunded by approximately 10.1 million, both of which are frozen and do not accrue any additional service cost. As such, the funded status is primarily impacted by the performance of the underlying assets supporting the plan and changes in interest rates or other factors, which may trigger additional cash contributions. Our pension obligations are calculated annually and are based on several assumptions, including then-prevailing conditions, which may change from year to year. If in any year our assumptions are inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated. 
 
 Unplanned outages at our facilities or those of our suppliers and other unforeseen disruptions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Our business depends on the operation of our manufacturing and distribution facilities as well as those of our suppliers. It is possible that we or they could experience prolonged periods of reduced production or distribution capacity due to interruptions in the operations of our facilities or those of our key suppliers. It is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances such as power outages, explosions, fires, floods, accidents, effects of a pandemic and severe weather conditions. Availability of raw materials and delivery of products to customers could be affected by logistical disruptions. To the extent that lost production or distribution capacity could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage, our sales and production costs could be adversely affected. 
 
 We rely on the efforts of agents and distributors to generate sales of our products. 
 
 We utilize various third-party agents and distributors to market, sell and distribute our products and to directly interact with our customers and end-users by providing customer service and support. No single agent or distributor accounts for a material percentage of our annual net sales. We do not have long-term contracts with our third-party agents and distributors, who could cease offering our products. In addition, many of our third-party agents and distributors with whom we transact business also offer the products of our competitors to our ultimate customers and they could begin offering our products with less prominence. The loss of a substantial number of our third-party agents or distributors or a dramatic deviation from the amount of sales they generate, including due to an increase in their sales of our competitors products, could reduce our sales and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 We may be required to recognize goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived asset impairment charges. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had goodwill of 311.1 million, intangible assets of 394.4 million, and other long-lived assets of 679.8 million. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are subject to impairment testing at least annually. Future events, such as declines in our cash flow projections or customer demand, may cause impairments of our goodwill or long-lived assets based on factors such as the price of our common stock, projected cash flows, assumptions used or other variables. 
 
 In addition, if we divest long-lived assets at prices below their asset value, we must write them down to fair value resulting in long-lived asset impairment charges, which could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. See Note 12, Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets, and we may be required to recognize goodwill or other asset impairment charges which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .

Our inability to introduce new products effectively or implement our innovation strategies could adversely affect our ability to compete. 
 
 We continually seek to develop products and solutions that allow us to stay at the forefront of developments in the Electrical and Safety Infrastructure markets. The success of new products depends on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, timely and successful product development, the effective consummation of strategic acquisitions, market acceptance and demand, competitive response, protection of associated intellectual property and avoidance of third-party infringement of the Company s intellectual property, our ability to manage risks associated with product life cycles, the effective management of inventory and purchase commitments, the availability and cost of raw materials and the quality of our initial products during the initial period of introduction. Some of the foregoing factors are beyond our control and we cannot fully predict the ultimate success of the introduction of new products, especially in the early stages of innovation. In introducing new products and implementing our innovation strategies, any delays, unexpected costs, diversion of resources, loss of key employees or other setbacks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 We are subject to certain safety and labor risks associated with the manufacturing and testing of our products. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, we employed approximately 5,600 total full-time equivalent employees, a significant percentage of whom work at our 49 manufacturing facilities. Our business involves complex manufacturing processes and there is a risk that an accident resulting in property damage, personal injury or death could occur in one of our facilities. In addition, prior to the introduction of new products, our employees test such products under rigorous conditions, which could potentially result in injury or death. The outcome of any personal injury, wrongful death or other litigation is difficult to assess or quantify and the cost to defend litigation can be significant. As a result, the costs to defend any action or the potential liability resulting from any such accident or death or arising out of any other litigation, and any negative publicity associated therewith or negative effects on employee morale, could have a negative effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, any accident could result in manufacturing or product delays, which could negatively affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . 
 
 The nature of our business exposes us to product liability, construction defect and warranty claims and litigation as well as other legal proceedings, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 We are exposed to construction defect and product liability claims relating to our various products if our products do not meet customer expectations. Such claims and liabilities may arise out of the quality of raw materials or component parts we purchase from third-party suppliers, over which we do not have direct control, or due to our fabrication, assembly, or damage in shipment of our products. In addition, we warrant certain of our products to be free of certain defects and could incur costs related to paying warranty claims in connection with defective products. We cannot assure you that we will not experience material losses or that we will not incur significant costs to defend or pay for such claims. 
 
 While we currently maintain insurance coverage to address a portion of these types of liabilities, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or that any such insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential claims. Further, while we intend to seek indemnification against potential liability for product liability claims from relevant parties, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to recover under any such indemnification agreements. Any claims that result in liability exceeding our insurance coverage and rights to indemnification by third parties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant time periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. An unsuccessful product liability defense could be highly costly and accordingly result in a decline in revenues and profitability. 
 20 

From time to time, we are also involved in government inquiries and investigations, as well as consumer, employment, tort proceedings and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take actions which would adversely affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management s attention and resources from other matters. 
 
 We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and we may become involved in intellectual property disputes. 
 
 Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and patent, trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate. We have registered intellectual property (mainly trademarks and patents) in more than 80 countries. Because of the differences in foreign trademark, patent and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws, we may not receive the same protection in foreign countries as we would in the United States. 
 
 Any failure of various measures to protect our technology and intellectual property, the independent discovery by third parties of our trade secrets and proprietary know-how and the independent development of substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques by third parties could impair our competitive advantage. In particular, the infringement, expiration or other loss of these methods and other proprietary information could reduce the barriers to entry into our existing lines of business and may result in a loss of market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims by third parties that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. A successful intellectual property infringement suit against us could prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain products in a particular area, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 We face risks associated with our international operations which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Our business operates and serves customers in certain foreign countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. There are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally, including economic volatility and sustained economic downturns, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency exchange controls, import or export restrictions, sanctions and changes in trade regulations, difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a number of foreign operations as a result of distance, issues related to occupational safety and adherence to local labor laws and regulations, potentially adverse tax developments, longer payment cycles, exposure to different legal standards, political or social unrest, including terrorism, risks related to government regulation and uncertain protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights, the presence of corruption in certain countries and higher than anticipated costs of entry. 
 
 In fiscal 2023, the Company determined it would exit its operations in Russia and expects to sell the related business at a loss. The Company recognized an impairment of 7,477 for the year ended September 30, 2023. The remaining value at risk related to these operations after the impairment is minimal. 
 
 One or more of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

21 

Changes in foreign laws and legal systems could materially impact our business. 
 
 Evolving foreign laws and legal systems, including those that occurred as a result of the United Kingdom s withdrawal from the European Union Brexit ), may adversely affect global economic and market conditions and could contribute to volatility in the foreign exchange markets. 
 
 The United Kingdom left the E.U. on January 31, 2020. On May 1, 2021, the E.U.-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the TCA became effective. The TCA provides the United Kingdom and E.U. members with preferential access to each other s markets, without tariffs or quotas on imported products between the jurisdictions, provided that certain rules of origin requirements are complied with. However, economic relations between the United Kingdom and the E.U. are now on more restricted terms than existed prior to Brexit. It is difficult to predict the severity of the impact of these changes on our United Kingdom and E.U. based operations. Goods moving between the United Kingdom and any member of the E.U. are subject to additional customs requirements and documentation checks, leading to possible higher transportation and regulatory costs, as well as delays at ports of entry and departure. Such delays could adversely impact elements of our supply chain and also our ability to meet customers delivery schedules. The United Kingdom has yet to determine which E.U. laws and regulations to replace or replicate and compliance with any amended or additional laws and regulations could increase our costs. To the extent that higher costs are incurred which cannot be passed on to our customers, this could decrease the profitability of our United Kingdom and E.U. operations. 
 
 Our business, financial position or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by our inability to acquire or import raw materials, component parts or finished goods from existing suppliers and significant increases in government regulation or restrictions relating to such imports. 
 
 Our business, financial position or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by our inability to import raw materials, component parts or finished goods under the regulatory regimes applicable to our business. Although we seek to have alternate sources and recover increases in input costs through price increases in our products, regulatory changes or other governmental actions could result in the need to change suppliers or incur cost increases that cannot, in the short term, or in some cases even the long term, be offset by our prices. Such changes could reduce our gross profit, net income and cash flow. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 We rely on materials, components and finished goods, such as Cpic fiber, steel and aluminum, that are sourced from or manufactured in foreign countries. Import tariffs and potential import tariffs have resulted or may result in increased prices for these imported goods and materials and, in some cases, may result or have resulted in price increases for domestically sourced goods and materials. Changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted and could result in additional reactions from U.S. trading partners, including adopting responsive trade policies making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products or import goods and materials from those countries. These measures could also result in increased costs for goods imported into the U.S. or may cause us to adjust our worldwide supply chain. Either of these could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on products sold. 
 
 Additionally, anti-terrorism measures and other disruptions to the raw material supply network could impact our operations and those of our suppliers. In the aftermath of terrorist attacks in the United States, federal, state and local authorities have implemented and continue to implement various security measures that affect the raw material supply network in the United States and abroad. If security measures disrupt or impede the receipt of sufficient raw materials to us and our suppliers, we may fail to meet the needs of our customers or may incur increased expenses to do so. 

In connection with acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, we may become subject to liabilities and required to issue additional debt or equity. 
 
 In connection with any acquisitions or joint ventures and agreements relating to Tyco s 2010 sale of a greater than 50 stake in the Company or otherwise, we may acquire or become subject to liabilities such as legal claims, including but not limited to third-party liability and other tort claims; claims for breach of contract; employment-related claims; environmental liabilities, conditions or damage; 
 22 

permitting, regulatory or other compliance with law issues; liability for hazardous materials; or tax liabilities. If any of these liabilities are not adequately covered by insurance or an enforceable indemnity or similar agreement from a creditworthy counterparty, we may be responsible for significant out-of-pocket expenditures. In connection with any divestitures, we may incur liabilities for breaches of representations and warranties or failure to comply with operating covenants under any agreement for a divestiture. In addition, we may have to indemnify a counterparty in a divestiture for certain liabilities of the subsidiary or operations subject to the divestiture transaction. These liabilities, if they materialize, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 In addition, if we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or through other arrangements. Such acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria and our credit rating. We cannot assure you that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required. Moreover, acquisitions financed through the issuance of equity securities could cause our stockholders to experience dilution. 
 
 We may be unable to identify, acquire, close or integrate acquisition targets successfully. 
 
 Acquisitions are a component of our growth strategy; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to grow our business through acquisitions as we have done historically or that any businesses acquired will perform in accordance with expectations or that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove to be correct. We will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing product offering. We cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future, nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or presents greater than expected liability profile or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses, create complexities in our supply chain and damage our reputation with customers. 
 
 As a public company, we are subject to the requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act. The SEC has adopted requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to conduct due diligence and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for efforts to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. 
 
 In addition, compliance with these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. Specifically, such requirements could limit the pool of suppliers who can provide conflict-free minerals and as a result, we may not be able to obtain these conflict-free minerals at competitive prices. We may also face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we have implemented. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers that may require all of the components of products purchased to be certified as conflict free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier, or we may be forced to reduce our prices to compensate for this lack of certification.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness 
 
 Our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 771.7 million of total long-term consolidated indebtedness outstanding (including current portion) under AI and AII s credit facilities Credit Facilities ), which consist of: (i) an asset-based credit facility ABL Credit Facility (ii) the new senior secured term loan facility (the New Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and (iii) the 4.25 Senior Notes due 2031 (the Senior Notes ). As of September 30, 2023, AII had 322.4 million of available borrowing capacity under the ABL Credit Facility and there were no outstanding borrowings (excluding 2.6 million of letters of credit issued under the facility). Our indebtedness could have important consequences for you. Because of our indebtedness: 
 
 our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness may be impaired in the future; 
 a large portion of our cash flow from operations may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes; 
 we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because a significant portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest; 
 it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to other creditors, resulting in possible defaults on, and acceleration of, such indebtedness; 
 we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
 we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with proportionately less indebtedness or with comparable indebtedness on more favorable terms and, as a result, they may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns; 
 our ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase; 
 our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited; and 
 we may be prevented from carrying out capital spending and restructurings that are necessary or important to our growth strategy and efforts to improve our operating margins. 

Despite our indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantially more indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our indebtedness. 
 
 We and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of thecredit agreements and indenture governing the Credit Facilities do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional debt. If our subsidiaries are in compliance with certain leverage or coverage ratios set forth in the agreements governing the Credit Facilities, they may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our current indebtedness. Subject to certain conditions and without the consent of the then existing lenders, the loans under the New Senior Secured Term Loan Facility may be expanded (or a new term loan facility, revolving credit facility or letter of credit facility added) by up to 235.0 million, plus an additional amount not to exceed specified leverage or coverage ratios. In addition, subject to certain conditions and without the consent of the then existing lenders, the loans under the ABL Credit Facility may be expanded by up to 150 million, and the credit agreements governing the Credit Facilities allow for up to 50.0 million of second lien facilities. As of September 30, 2023, we had an additional 322.4 million in availability under the ABL Credit Facility. 

24 

Increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our indebtedness and could reduce our profitability. 
 
 A portion of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest or will bear interest at variable rates. As a result, increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our indebtedness and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of September 30, 2023, each one percentage point change in interest rates would have resulted in a change of approximately 3.8 million in the annual interest expense on the New Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. As of September 30, 2023, assuming availability was fully utilized, each one percentage point change in interest rates would have resulted in a change of approximately 3.3 million in annual interest expense on the ABL Credit Facility. Additionally, if the ABL Credit Facility were fully utilized, the margin we pay on borrowings would increase by 0.3 from the current level and we would incur additional interest expense of 1.0 million. The impact of increases in interest rates could be more significant for us than it would be for some other companies because of our indebtedness, thereby affecting our profitability. 
 
 A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings, outlook or watch assigned to our indebtedness by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital. 
 
 Our overall corporate rating and Senior Notes are currently rated as non-investment grade, but our New Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and ABL Credit Facility have been assigned investment grade ratings by certain ratings agencies. Any rating, outlook or watch assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency s judgment, current or future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, outlook or watch, such as adverse changes to our business, so warrant. Any future lowering of our ratings, outlook or watch likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing. 
 
 The agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business. 
 
 The Credit Facilities contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of AII and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and create liens, pay dividends and make other distributions or to purchase, redeem or retire capital stock, purchase, redeem or retire certain junior indebtedness, make loans and investments, enter into agreements that limit AII s or its subsidiaries' ability to pledge assets or to make distributions or loans to us or transfer assets to us, sell assets, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, consolidate, merge or sell substantially all assets, make voluntary payments or modifications of junior indebtedness and enter into new lines of business. 
 
 The restrictions in the Credit Facilities may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. Additionally, we may be required to make accelerated payments due to the covenants and restrictions contained in the Credit Facilities. We may be unable to refinance our indebtedness, at maturity or otherwise, on terms acceptable to us or at all. 
 
 The ability of AII to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the Credit Facilities may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control including credit or capital market disruptions. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default that would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we are unable to repay indebtedness, lenders having secured obligations, such as the lenders under the Credit Facilities, could proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness. In any such case, we may be unable to borrow under the Credit Facilities and may not be able to repay the amounts due under such facilities. This could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent. 
 
 25 

Our ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness and our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control. 
 
 Atkore Inc. AI and AII are each holding companies, and as such they have no independent operations or material assets other than ownership of equity interests in their respective subsidiaries. AI and AII each depend on their respective subsidiaries to distribute funds to them so that they may pay obligations and expenses, including satisfying obligations with respect to indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under, our indebtedness depends on the financial and operating performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions and dividends to us, which, in turn, depends on their results of operations, cash flows, cash requirements, financial position and general business conditions and any legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends to which they may be subject, many of which may be beyond our control. 
 
 We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek to obtain additional equity capital or restructure our indebtedness. In the future, our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our indebtedness, and such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. 
 
 The outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility are scheduled to mature on May 26, 2026, the New Senior Secured Term Loan Facility has a maturity date of May 26, 2028, and the Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2031. We may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, particularly because of our indebtedness. Market disruptions, as well as our indebtedness levels, may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to refinance our obligations as they become due. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness or access additional credit, or if short-term or long-term borrowing costs dramatically increase, our ability to finance current operations and meet our short-term and long-term obligations could be adversely affected. 
 
 If our subsidiary AII cannot make scheduled payments on its indebtedness, it will be in default and the lenders under the Credit Facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money or foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. 
 
 Our ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to pay dividends depends on many factors beyond our control. 
 
 We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay dividends. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient, payment of declared dividends could be left unpaid. In the future, our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for the continuation of any dividend programs approved by the board of directors. As a result, we may not be able to pay dividends or continue to pay dividends at the expected rate or at all in November 2023. 
 
 Payments of dividends, if any, are at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including general and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications of the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries (including AII) to us, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries. As such, to the extent that we determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock, none of our subsidiaries will be obligated to make funds available to us for the payment of dividends. Further, the agreements governing the Credit Facilities significantly restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to us. In addition, Delaware law imposes additional requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock. 
 
 To the extent that expectations by market participants regarding the potential payment, or amount, of any regular dividend prove to be incorrect, the price of our common stock may be materially and negatively affected and investors that bought shares of our common stock based on those expectations may suffer a loss on their investment. Further, to the extent that we declare a regular dividend at a time 
 26 

when market participants hold no such expectations or the amount of any such dividend exceeds current expectations, the price of our common stock may increase and investors that sold shares of our common stock prior to the record date for any such dividend may forego potential gains on their investment. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
 
 AI is a holding company with no operations of its own, and it depends on its subsidiaries for cash to fund all of its operations and expenses, including to make future dividend payments, if any. 
 
 Our operations are conducted entirely through our subsidiaries, and our ability to generate cash to fund our operations and expenses, to pay dividends or to meet debt service obligations is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of AII and its subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent our subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of our financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide funds to the extent of our needs, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 For example, the agreements governing the Credit Facilities significantly restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, make loans or otherwise transfer assets to us. Furthermore, our subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of the Credit Facilities to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict or prohibit the making of distributions, the payment of dividends or the making of loans by such subsidiaries to us. 
 
 The timing and amount of the Company s share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties. 
 On November 16, 2021, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an aggregate amount of 400.0 million of the Company s common stock over a two-year period. On April 6, 2022, the board of directors approved an amendment to the aforementioned plan, extending it to a total repurchase of the Company s outstanding stock of 800.0 million. On November 11, 2022, the board of directors approved an amendment to the aforementioned plan, extending it to a total repurchase authorization of the Company s outstanding stock of 1,300 million. We expect that share repurchases under the program will be funded with cash on hand. The amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause the Company to limit, suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions, the price of the Company s common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time, the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of U.S. cash. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be terminated at any time at the Company s discretion. 
 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock. 
 
 Our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our fourth amended and restated by-laws, amended and restated by-laws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws collectively: 
 
 authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt; 
 limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors; 
 provide that vacancies on our board of directors, including vacancies resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office; 
 prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders; 
 27 

prohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of stockholders; and 
 establish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders. 
 
 These provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. 
 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. Furthermore, the existence of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders. 

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes provisions limiting the personal liability of our directors for breaches of fiduciary duty under the DGCL. 
 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions relating to the liability of directors in response to claims arising under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware DGCL ). These provisions eliminate a director s personal liability to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL for monetary damages resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty, except in circumstances involving: 
 
 any breach of the director s duty of loyalty; 
 acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law; 
 Section 174 of the DGCL (unlawful dividends); or 
 any transaction from which the director derives an improper personal benefit. 
 
 The principal effect of the limitation on liability provision is that a stockholder will be unable to prosecute an action for monetary damages against a director unless the stockholder can demonstrate a basis for liability for which indemnification is not available under the DGCL. These provisions, however, should not limit or eliminate our rights or any stockholder s rights to seek non-monetary relief, such as an injunction or rescission, in the event of a breach of a director s fiduciary duty. These provisions do not alter a director s liability under federal securities laws. The inclusion of this provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for a breach of their fiduciary duties, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited us and our stockholders. 
 28 

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or stockholders. 
 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, other employees, agents or stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising out of or under the DGCL, or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (including, without limitation, any action asserting a claim arising out of or pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated by-laws) or (iv) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. As a stockholder in our company, you are deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees, agents or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

General Risk Factors 
 
 The market price of our common stock may be volatile and could decline. 
 
 The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are: 
 industry or general market conditions; 
 availability of labor and raw materials; 
 domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; 
 changes in our customers preferences; 
 new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines; 
 lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities; 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results; 
 changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance or lack of research coverage and reports by industry analysts; 
 action by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders, including future sales of our common stock; 
 failure to meet any guidance given by us or any change in any guidance given by us, or changes by us in our guidance practices; 
 announcements by us of significant impairment charges; 
 speculation in the press or investment community; 
 investor perception of us and our industry; 
 changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies; 
 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions or strategic partnerships; 
 war, terrorist acts and epidemic disease; 
 any future sales of our common stock or other securities; 
 additions or departures of key personnel; and 
 misconduct or other improper actions of our employees. 
 
 29 

Stock markets have experienced extreme volatility in recent years that has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. 
 
 The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts that covers our common stock downgrades our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of the analysts ceases coverage of our common stock or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline. 
 
 If we are unable to hire, engage and retain key personnel, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 We are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to hire, engage and retain key employees at our operations around the world. Additionally, we rely upon experienced managerial, marketing and support personnel to effectively manage our business and to successfully promote our wide range of products. If we do not succeed in engaging and retaining key employees and other personnel, or if we do not succeed in facilitating transitions of new key personnel, we may be unable to meet our objectives and, as a result, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Future tax legislation could materially impact our business. 
 
 Changes in international and domestic tax laws, including the reaction by states to federal legislation and changes in tax law enforcement, could negatively impact our tax provision, cash flow, or tax related balance sheet amounts. In particular, it is possible that U.S. federal income or other tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws will change, including as a result of possible tax legislation that may be proposed by the Biden Administration. It is difficult to predict whether and when there will be tax law changes having a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA was enacted into law. The IRA contains significant tax law changes, including a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15 on adjusted financial statement income, which if applicable for us would be effective beginning October 1, 2023, a 1 excise tax on stock repurchases after December 31, 2022, and various tax incentives which include, but are not limited to, credits related to the manufacturing of solar powered energy which took effect January 1, 2023. We continue to evaluate this legislation and regulatory guidance to determine what impact it will have on our financial statements. 
 
 On October 8, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD released a statement on the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, which agreed to a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges of the digital economy. On December 20, 2021, the OECD released the Model GloBE Rules for Pillar Two defining a 15 global minimum tax rate for large multinational corporations. The OECD continues to release additional guidance and countries are implementing legislation with widespread adoption of the Model GloBE Rules for Pillar Two expected by calendar year 2024. We are continuing to evaluate the Model GloBE Rules for Pillar Two and related legislation, and their potential impact on future periods. 
 
 30 

Changes in U.S. tax law could also have broader implications, including impacts to the economy, currency markets, inflation environment, consumer behavior or competitive dynamics, which are difficult to predict, and may positively or negatively impact our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Future offerings of debt or equity securities which would rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 
 If, in the future, we decide to issue debt or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock, it is likely that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us. 
 
 We may need to raise additional capital, and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available. 
 
 To satisfy existing obligations and support the development of our business, we depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to borrow funds and issue securities in the capital markets. We may require additional financing for liquidity, capital requirements or growth initiatives. We may not be able to obtain financing on terms and at interest rates that are favorable to us or at all. Any inability by us to obtain financing in the future could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Holders 
 
 As of November 14, 2023, there was one stockholder of record of our common stock. This number excludes stockholders whose stock is held in nominee or street name by brokers. 
 
 Dividend Policy 
 
 On November 17, 2023, we announced that our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend program under which the Company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. 
 
 The quarterly dividend program and the subsequent consideration, declaration and payment of each quarterly cash dividend will be subject to our board s approval. Our board of directors retain the power to modify, suspend or cancel the dividend program in any manner and at any time that our board may deem necessary or appropriate. 
 
 Our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock is significantly limited as a practical matter by the Credit Facilities insofar as we may seek to pay dividends out of funds made available to us by AII or its subsidiaries, because AII's debt instruments directly or indirectly restrict AII's ability to pay dividends or make loans to us. Any future determination to pay dividends on our common stock will be subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon various factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity requirements, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of dividends, restrictions imposed by Delaware law, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 The following table shows our share repurchase programs, on a trade date basis, for each of our fiscal months for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 (in thousands, except per share data): 
 Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program(1) Maximum Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program(1) July 1, 2023 to July 28, 2023 384,095 July 29, 2023 to September 1, 2023 90 153.64 90 370,238 September 2, 2023 - September 30, 2023 406 150.68 406 309,095 Total 496 496 
 
 (1) On November 16, 2021, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program, under which the Company may repurchase up to 400.0 million of its outstanding common stock. On April 6, 2022, the board of directors approved an amendment to the aforementioned plan, extending it to a total repurchase of the Company s outstanding common stock of up to 800.0 million. On November 11, 2022, the board of directors approved an amendment to the aforementioned plan, extending it to a total repurchase authorization of the Company s outstanding stock of 1,300 million. These share repurchase programs were funded from the Company's available cash balances. Under the share repurchase programs, the Company was not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may have been terminated at any time at the Company's discretion.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report. 
 The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information and Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The percentages provided below reflect rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures expressed as percentages when aggregated may not be the arithmetic sum of the percentages that precede them. 
 
 Business Factors Influencing our Results of Operations 
 
 We are a leading manufacturer of Electrical products primarily for the non-residential construction and renovation markets and Safety Infrastructure for the construction and industrial markets. The Electrical segment manufactures high quality products used in the construction of electrical power systems including conduit, cable and installation accessories. The Safety Infrastructure segment designs and manufactures solutions including metal framing, mechanical pipe, perimeter security and cable management for the protection and reliability of critical infrastructure. We believe we hold #1 or #2 positions in the United States by net sales in the vast majority of our products. The quality of our products, the strength of our brands and our scale and presence provide what we believe to be a unique set of competitive advantages that position us for profitable growth. 
 
 The following factors may affect our results of operations in any given period: 
 
 Economic Conditions. Our business depends on demand from customers across various end markets, including wholesale distributors, OEMs, retail distributors and general contractors. Our products are primarily used by trade contractors in the construction and renovation of non-residential structures such as commercial office buildings, healthcare facilities and manufacturing plants. In fiscal 2023, 90 of our net sales were to customers located in the United States. As a result, our business is heavily dependent on the health of the United States economy, in general, and on United States non-residential construction activity, in particular. A stronger United States economy and robust non-residential construction generally increase demand for our products. In fiscal 2023, our sales and cost of sales were impacted by pricing normalization in certain raw materials used in our products. We generally sell our products on a spot basis and as such, were exposed to sales prices on our products that decreased faster than the cost for the related raw materials. 
 
 We believe that our business and demand for our products is influenced by two main economic indicators: United States gross domestic product, or GDP, and non-residential construction starts, measured in square footage. The United States non-residential construction market has experienced modest growth over the past few years, in line with United States GDP. Our historic results have been positively impacted by growth in the non-residential construction market, as such growth leads to greater demand for our products. MR R activity generally increases and represents a greater share of non-residential construction activity during challenging periods in the economic or construction cycle. During those periods, our MR R demand as a percentage of total demand typically increases, providing a more consistent revenue stream for our business. 
 
 Additionally, central bank interest rate increases, inflation, and conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are creating additional uncertainty in the global economy, generally, and in the markets in which we operate. The aforementioned conflicts and other factors have had and will continue to have adverse effects on global supply chains, which may impact some aspects of our business. Furthermore, we are mindful of the effects that adverse weather, such as hurricanes, can have on our domestic supply chain. 
 
 36 

Raw Materials. We use a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products, which primarily include steel, copper, PVC and HDPE resin. We believe that sources for these raw materials are well established, generally available and are in sufficient quantity that we may avoid disruption in our business. The cost to procure these raw materials is subject to price fluctuations, often as a result of macroeconomic conditions. Our cost of sales may be affected by changes in the market price of these materials, and to a lesser extent, other commodities, such as zinc, aluminum, electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel. The prices at which we sell our products may adjust upward or downward based on raw material price changes. We believe several factors drive the pricing of our products, including the quality of our products, the ability to meet customer delivery expectations and co-loading capabilities, as well as the prices of our raw material inputs. Historically, we have not engaged in hedging strategies for raw material purchases. Our results may be impacted by inventory sales at costs higher or lower than current prices we pay for similar items. 
 
 Working Capital. Our working capital requirements are impacted by our operational activities. Our inventory levels may be impacted from time to time, due to delivery lead times from our suppliers. Our cash collection cycle is generally one to two months longer than our cash payment cycle. If our working capital requirements increase and we are unable to finance our working capital on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may not be able to obtain raw materials to respond to customer demand, which could result in a loss of sales. 
 
 Labor Cost and Availability . Labor costs are a direct input into the manufacture of our products. Labor costs are capitalized as a cost of inventory. 
 
 Seasonality. In a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically, sales of our products have been higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather for construction-related activities. 
 
 Recent Acquisitions . In addition to our organic growth, we have transformed the Company through acquisitions in recent years, allowing us to expand our product offerings with existing and new customers. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), the results of our acquisitions are reflected in our financial statements from the date of each acquisition forward. 
 
 Our acquisition strategy has focused primarily on growing market share by complementing our existing portfolio with synergistic products and expanding into end-markets that we have not previously served. In total, we have invested 468.5 million in acquisitions since 2021. 
 
 We expect to continue to pursue synergistic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy to expand our product offerings. See Note 3, Acquisitions to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 
 Foreign Currencies . In fiscal 2023, approximately 10 of our net sales came from customers located outside the United States, most of which were foreign currency sales denominated in British pounds sterling, European euros, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, and New Zealand dollars. The functional currency of our operations outside the United States is generally the local currency. Assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars using period-end exchange rates. Foreign revenue and expenses are translated at the monthly average exchange rates in effect during the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) within our statements of comprehensive income. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk. 
 
 See Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 
 37 

Emerging Industry Trends . Pressure from regulators, and expectations from customers, to combat climate change may accelerate the move to more renewable power generation, the electrification of buildings and transportation, and the use of more sustainable methods in construction in our markets. The rapid market growth for the use of digital technologies may continue to drive the need for more digital infrastructure such as data centers and the need for advanced warehousing and distribution centers to support e-commerce. Atkore offers products including electrical conduit fittings, electrical cable cable management, metal framing and racking structures that are commonly used in the construction of new and renovated buildings, infrastructure, renewable power systems, data centers, warehouses, and to connect electric vehicle charging stations to the electrical grid. Increases in demand for these applications in our markets may drive an increased demand for Atkore products. 
 
 Reportable Segments 
 
 We operate our business through two operating segments which are also our reportable segments: Electrical and Safety Infrastructure. Our operating segments are organized based on primary market channel and, in most instances, the end use of products. We review the results of our operating segments separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. We evaluate performance on the basis of net sales and Adjusted EBITDA. 
 
 The Electrical segment manufactures high quality products used in the construction of electrical power systems including conduit, cable, and installation accessories. This segment serves contractors in partnership with the electrical wholesale channel . 
 
 The Safety Infrastructure segment designs and manufactures solutions including metal framing, mechanical pipe, perimeter security, and cable management for the protection and reliability of critical infrastructure. These solutions are marketed to contractors, original equipment manufacturers and end users. 
 
 Both segments use Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of profit and loss. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is the income (loss) before income taxes, adjusted to exclude unallocated expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net, loss on extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, impairment charges, stock-based compensation, certain legal matters, transaction costs, gain on purchase of business, gain on sale of a business and other items, such as inventory reserves and adjustments, loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, insurance recovery related to damages of property, plant and equipment, release of indemnified uncertain tax positions, and realized or unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency impacts of intercompany loans and related forward currency derivatives. See Note 17, Segment Information to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 
 Fiscal Periods 
 
 The Company has a fiscal year that ends on September 30. The Company s fiscal quarters typically end on the last Friday in December, March and June as it follows a 4-5-4 calendar. 
 
 Key Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Net sales 
 
 Net sales represents external sales of Electrical products to the non-residential construction and MR R markets and Safety Infrastructure products and solutions to the commercial and industrial markets. Net sales includes gross product sales and freight billed to our customers, net of allowances for rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, product returns and discounts. 

38 

Cost of sales 
 
 Cost of sales includes all costs directly related to the production of goods for sale. These costs include direct material, direct labor, production related overheads, excess and obsolescence costs, lower-of-cost-or-market provisions, freight and distribution costs and the depreciation and amortization of assets directly used in the production of goods for sale. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses include payroll related expenses including salaries, wages, employee benefits, payroll taxes, variable cash compensation for both administrative and selling personnel and consulting and professional services fees. Also included are compensation expense for share-based awards, restructuring-related charges, third-party professional services and translation gains or losses for foreign currency trade transactions. 

Results of Operations 
 
 Fiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022 
 
 The results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 were as follows: 
 
 Fiscal year ended in thousands) September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Change ) Change ) Net sales 3,518,761 3,913,949 (395,188) (10.1) Cost of sales 2,179,260 2,273,924 (94,664) (4.2) Gross profit 1,339,501 1,640,025 (300,524) (18.3) Selling, general and administrative 388,206 370,044 18,162 4.9 Intangible asset amortization 57,804 36,176 21,628 59.8 Operating income 893,491 1,233,805 (340,314) (27.6) Interest expense, net 35,232 30,676 4,556 14.9 Other (income) and expense, net 7,969 (490) 8,459 (1,726.3) Income before income taxes 850,290 1,203,620 (353,330) (29.4) Income tax expense 160,391 290,186 (129,795) (44.7) Net income 689,899 913,434 (223,535) (24.5)

Net sales for fiscal 2023 decreased 395.2 million to 3,518.8 million, a decrease of 10.1 , compared to 3,913.9 million for fiscal 2022. The decrease in net sales is primarily attributed to lower average selling prices of 646.6 million, the economic value of solar tax credits to be transferred to certain customers of 30.4 million and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 15.1 million. These decreases are partially offset by increased net sales of 168.9 million from companies acquired during fiscal 2022 and 2023 and higher sales volume of 125.1 million across varying product categories within both the Electrical and the Safety Infrastructure segments. 
 
 Cost of sales 
 Change ) Volume 4.8 Average input costs (15.0) Acquisitions 5.8 Other 0.2 Cost of sales (4.2) 
 
 Cost of sales decreased 94.7 million, or 4.2 , to 2,179.3 million for fiscal 2023 compared to 2,273.9 million for fiscal 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower input costs of steel, copper and PVC resin of 337.8 million and the impact of foreign exchange rates of 13.0 million partially offset by recent acquisitions during fiscal 2022 and 2023 of 130.3 million and higher sales volume of 107.7 million. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 18.2 million, or 4.9 , to 388.2 million for fiscal 2023 compared to 370.0 million for fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount of 16.6 million, digital initiatives of 16.1 million, recent acquisitions in fiscal 2022 and 2023 of 14.6 million, and stock compensation of 3.8 million. These increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation of 15.4 million, lower sales commission expense of 9.9 million, lower transaction costs of 2.5 million and 5.1 million is spread across a variety of other spend categories. 
 
 Intangible asset amortization 
 
 Intangible asset amortization expense increased 21.6 million, or 59.8 , to 57.8 million for fiscal 2023 compared to 36.2 million for fiscal 2022. The increase in intangible asset amortization is primarily driven by the acquisition of definite-lived intangible assets through businesses acquired in fiscal 2022 and 2023. 
 
 Interest expense, net 
 
 Interest expense, net, increased 4.6 million, or 14.9 to 35.2 million for fiscal 2023, compared to 30.7 million for fiscal 2022. The increase is primarily due to increased interest rates on the Company s New Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. 
 
 Other (income) and expense, net 
 
 Other (income) and expense, net increased 8.5 million to expense of 8.0 million for fiscal 2023, compared to income of 0.5 million for fiscal 2022. The increase in expense was primarily due to impairments recognized in connection with the Company s plans to exit from operations in Russia of 7.5 million. 
 40 

Income tax expense 
 
 Income tax expense decreased 129.8 million to 160.4 million, compared to 290.2 million for fiscal 2022. The Company's income tax rate decreased to 18.9 for fiscal 2023, compared to 24.1 for fiscal 2022. The decrease in income tax expense is due to lower income before taxes and solar tax credits generated during fiscal 2023, while the decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to solar tax credits generated during fiscal 2023. See Note 7, Income Taxes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

 Adjusted EBITDA decreased 35.2 million, or 25.4 , to 103.2 million for fiscal 2023 compared to 138.4 million for fiscal 2022. The Adjusted EBITDA decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices and over input costs and the impacts of solar tax credits transferred to certain customers. 
 
 Fiscal 2022 Compared to Fiscal 2021 
 
 The results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 were as follows: 
 Fiscal year ended in thousands) September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Change ) Change ) Net sales 3,913,949 2,928,014 985,935 33.7 Cost of sales 2,273,924 1,802,401 471,523 26.2 Gross profit 1,640,025 1,125,613 514,412 45.7 Selling, general and administrative 370,044 293,019 77,025 26.3 Intangible asset amortization 36,176 33,644 2,532 7.5 Operating income 1,233,805 798,950 434,855 54.4 Interest expense, net 30,676 32,899 (2,223) (6.8) Loss on extinguishment of debt 4,202 (4,202) (100.0) Other (income) and expense, net (490) (18,152) 17,662 (97.3) Income before income taxes 1,203,620 780,001 423,619 54.3 Income tax expense 290,186 192,144 98,042 51.0 Net income 913,434 587,857 325,577 55.4

 42 

Net sales for fiscal 2022 increased 985.9 million to 3,913.9 million, an increase of 33.7 , compared to 2,928.0 million for fiscal 2021. The increase in net sales is primarily attributed to increased average selling prices of 996.2 million which were mostly driven by the plastic pipe and conduit category within the Electrical segment and increased net sales of 96.4 million from companies acquired during fiscal 2021 and 2022. These increases are offset by decreased sales volume of 94.8 million across varying product categories within both the Electrical and the Safety Infrastructure segments. Pricing for PVC products, as well as other products, has begun to decline from historic highs. 
 
 Cost of sales 
 Change ) Volume (2.9) Average input costs 22.5 Acquisitions 3.9 Other 2.7 Cost of sales 26.2 
 
 Cost of sales increased 471.5 million, or 26.2 , to 2,273.9 million for fiscal 2022 compared to 1,802.4 million for fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher input costs of steel, copper and PVC resin of 405.5 million and recent acquisitions during fiscal 2021 and 2022 of 70.4 million, partially offset by lower sales volume of 52.8 million across varying product categories within both the Electrical and the Safety Infrastructure segments. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 77.0 million, or 26.3 , to 370.0 million for fiscal 2022 compared to 293.0 million for fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher sales commission expense of 21.1 million, increased general spending on business improvement initiatives of 29.8 million, higher variable compensation of 6.5 million, transaction costs of 2.6 million, and recent acquisitions in fiscal 2021 and 2022 of 7.4 million. The remaining increase of 9.6 million is spread across a variety of other spend categories. 
 
 Intangible asset amortization 
 
 Intangible asset amortization expense increased 2.5 million, or 7.5 , to 36.2 million for fiscal 2022 compared to 33.6 million for fiscal 2021. The increase in intangible asset amortization is primarily driven by the acquisition of definite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2022. 
 
 Interest expense, net 
 
 Interest expense, net, decreased 2.2 million, or 6.8 to 30.7 million for fiscal 2022, compared to 32.9 million for fiscal 2021. The decrease is primarily due to debt refinancing and principal prepayments in the second half of 2021 resulting in a lower average principal balance in fiscal 2022 from which interest expense was derived. 

Other (income) and expense, net 
 
 Other income, net increased 17.7 million to 0.5 million for fiscal 2022, compared to income of 18.2 million for fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 15.5 million business interruption insurance recovery from a flood at one of the Company s manufacturing facilities. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies and Note 6, Other Income, net to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

43 

Income tax expense 
 
 Income tax expense increased 98.0 million to 290.2 million, compared to 192.1 million for fiscal 2021. The Company's income tax rate decreased to 24.1 for fiscal 2022, compared to 24.6 for fiscal 2021. The increase in income tax expense is due to higher income before taxes, while the decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in state income taxes. See Note 7, Income Taxes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

 Adjusted EBITDA increased 56.6 million, or 69.1 , to 138.4 million for fiscal 2021 compared to 81.8 million for fiscal 2020. The Adjusted EBITDA increase was primarily due to the increase in average selling prices and volume discussed above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 On November 17, 2023, we announced that our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend program under which the Company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. 
 
 The quarterly dividend program and the subsequent consideration, declaration and payment of each quarterly cash dividend will be subject to our board s approval. Our board of directors retain the power to modify, suspend, or cancel the dividend program in any manner and at any time that our board may deem necessary or appropriate. 
 
 We believe we have sufficient liquidity to support our ongoing operations and to invest in future growth and create value for stockholders. Our cash and cash equivalents were 388.1 million as of September 30, 2023, of which 77.2 million was held at non-U.S. subsidiaries. Those cash balances at foreign subsidiaries may be subject to withholding or local country taxes if the Company's intention to permanently reinvest such income were to change and cash was repatriated to the United States. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased 0.6 million from September 30, 2022, primarily due to acquisitions, capital expenditures and share repurchases and partially offset by cash provided from operating activities. 
 
 In general, we require cash to fund working capital investments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt repayment, interest payments, taxes and share repurchases. We have access to the ABL Credit Facility to fund our operational needs. As of September 30, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility (excluding 2.6 million of standby letters of credit issued under the ABL Credit Facility). The borrowing base was estimated to be 325.0 million and approximately 322.4 million was available under the ABL Credit Facility as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Our use of cash may fluctuate during the year and from year to year due to differences in demand and changes in economic conditions primarily related to the prices of commodities we purchase. 
 
 Capital expenditures have historically been necessary to expand and update the production capacity and improve the productivity of our manufacturing operations and IT initiatives aimed to facilitate the ease of doing business with Atkore. In FY23, 142.7 million was spent on equipment related to growth initiatives in solar, plastics and regional services centers. 
 
 We have purchase commitments of 127.8 million and 3.8 million for the years 2023 and 2024, which represent purchases of raw materials in the normal course of business for which all significant terms have been confirmed. 
 
 45 

As of September 30, 2023, we had 6.3 million of income tax liability, gross unrecognized tax benefits of 3 million and gross interest and penalties of 0.2 million. Of these amounts, 2.4 million is classified as a non-current liability in the consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 The projected company pension contribution for fiscal 2024 is 0.3 million. 
 
 Servicing of our existing debt instruments includes the following estimated cash outflows: 
 
 in thousands) Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Total Senior Notes due June 2031 400,000 400,000 New Senior Secured Term Loan Facility Due May 2028 371,667 371,667 Interest payments (a) 47,173 83,958 77,290 51,708 260,129 Total 47,173 83,958 77,290 823,375 1,031,796 (a) Interest expense is estimated based on outstanding loan balances assuming principal payments are made according to the payment schedule and interest rates as of September 30, 2023 (4.25 for the Senior Notes, between 5.6 and 7.7 for the New Senior Secured Term Loan Facility). 
 
 Our ongoing liquidity needs are expected to be funded by cash on hand, net cash provided by operating activities and, as required, borrowings under the Credit Facilities. We expect that cash provided from operations and available capacity under the ABL Credit Facility will provide sufficient funds to operate our business, make expected capital expenditures and meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months, including payment of interest and principal on our debt. 
 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 
 Limitations on Distributions and Dividends by Subsidiaries 
 
 AI and AII are each holding companies, and as such have no independent operations or material assets other than ownership of equity interests in their respective subsidiaries. Each company depends on its respective subsidiaries to distribute funds to them so that they may pay obligations and expenses, including satisfying obligations with respect to indebtedness. The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions and dividends to us depends on their operating results, cash requirements and financial and general business conditions, as well as restrictions under the laws of our subsidiaries' jurisdictions. 
 
 The agreements governing the Credit Facilities significantly restrict the ability of our subsidiaries, including AII, to pay dividends, make loans or otherwise transfer assets from AII and, in turn, to us. Further, AII's subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of the Credit Facilities to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict or prohibit the making of distributions, the payment of dividends or the making of loans by such subsidiaries to AII and, in turn, to us. The New Senior Secured Term Loan Facility requires AII to meet a certain consolidated coverage ratio on an incurrence basis in connection with additional indebtedness. The ABL Credit Facility contains limits on additional indebtedness based on various conditions for incurring the additional debt. AII has been in compliance with the covenants under the agreements for all periods presented. See Note 13, Debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

 Operating activities 
 
 During fiscal 2023, operating activities provided 807.6 million of cash, compared to 786.8 million during fiscal year 2022. Cash provided by operating activities increased by 20.8 million primarily driven by less cash used in working capital of 105.8 million, tax impacts of 229.3 million and partially offset by lower operating income of 340.3 million. 
 
 Investing activities 
 
 During fiscal 2023, we used 302.2 million of cash for investing activities compared to 442.8 million during fiscal 2022. The 140.7 million decrease in cash used by investing activities was primarily driven by 224.4 million in decreased cash used for acquisitions in fiscal 2022, partially offset by increased capital expenditures of 83.1 million. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 During fiscal 2023, we used 506.8 million for financing activities compared to 524.2 million during fiscal 2022. The decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by repurchases of shares of 491.0 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to 500.2 million of share repurchases in fiscal 2022. 
 
 The table below summarizes cash flow information derived from our statements of cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.

 Operating activities 
 
 During fiscal 2022, operating activities provided 786.8 million of cash, compared to 572.9 million during fiscal year 2021. The 213.9 million increase was primarily driven by improved operating income of 434.9 million year over year and was partially offset by increased tax impacts of 224.8 million, with cash used in working capital relatively flat year over year. 

47 

Investing activities 
 
 During fiscal 2022, we used 442.8 million of cash for investing activities compared to 98.0 million during fiscal 2021. The 344.8 million increase in cash used by investing activities was primarily driven by 264.6 million in increased cash used for acquisitions in fiscal 2022 over the prior year as well as increased capital expenditures of 71.3 million, which includes the purchase of facilities in Dallas, Texas. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 During fiscal 2022, we used 524.2 million for financing activities compared to 184.5 million during fiscal 2021. Cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by repurchases of shares of 500.2 million as compared to 135.1 million of share repurchases in fiscal 2021. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations, financial condition and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following are our most critical accounting policies, which are those that require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, requiring the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. 
 
 The following discussion is not intended to represent a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 The Company s revenue arrangements primarily consist of a single performance obligation to transfer promised goods which is satisfied at a point in time when title, risks and rewards of ownership, and subsequently control have transferred to the customer. This generally occurs when the product is shipped to the customer, with an immaterial amount of transactions in which control transfers upon delivery. The Company primarily offers assurance-type standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations. 
 
 The Company has certain arrangements that require it to estimate at the time of sale the amounts of variable consideration that should not be recorded as revenue as certain amounts are not expected to be collected from customers, as well as an estimate of the value of products to be returned. The Company principally relies on historical experience, specific customer agreements, and anticipated future trends to estimate these amounts at the time of sale and to reduce the transaction price. These arrangements include sales discounts and allowances, volume rebates, and returned goods. Historically, adjustments related to these estimates have not been material. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Certain deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly, considering available positive and negative evidence, including our past results, estimated future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies in the applicable tax paying jurisdiction. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is considered more likely than not to be realized. Valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations, changes in tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates, and changes in our forecasted future taxable income. Any reduction in future taxable income, including but not limited to any future 
 48 

restructuring activities, may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. 
 
 In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Certain tax positions may be considered uncertain requiring an assessment of whether an allowance should be recorded. Our provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold based on an estimate of whether it is more likely than not that a position will be sustained upon examination. We measure our uncertain tax position as the largest amount of benefit that has greater than a 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of provision for income taxes. 
 
 We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. See Note 7, Income Taxes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 
 Business Combinations 
 
 We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. 
 
 Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill Impairments 
 
 Goodwill and other intangible assets primarily result from business combinations. The Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived trade names on an annual basis in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. The measurement date is the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently, if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or the respective indefinite-lived trade name is less than the carrying value. The Company can elect to perform a quantitative or qualitative test of impairment. 
 
 For fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 the Company performed a quantitative impairment assessment for goodwill. The Company calculated the fair value of its six reporting units considering three valuation approaches: (a) the income approach; (b) the guideline public company method; and (c) the comparable transaction method. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital (Discount Rate) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using market observable inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit s forecasted performance. The key uncertainties in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit s forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and EBITDA margins, as well as the perceived risk associated 
 49 

with those forecasts. Fair value under the guideline public company method is determined for each reporting unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the reporting unit s financial results. Fair value under the comparable transaction method is determined based on exchange prices in actual transactions and on asking prices for controlling interests in public or private companies currently offered for sale by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit s financial results. The key uncertainties in the guideline public company method and the comparable transaction method calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit's comparable public companies, comparable transactions and the selection of the market multiples. 
 
 The Company did not record any goodwill impairments in fiscal 2022 or 2021. In 2023, as a result of the Company s plan to exit operations in Russia and expectation to sell the related business at a loss, the Company recognized a 1.7 million goodwill impairment on the related reporting unit on a relative fair value basis. Excluding the goodwill impairment on the Company s Russia business, as of September 30, 2023, the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amount by 10 or more. A 10 decrease in the discounted cash flows utilized in quantitative impairment assessment for each of the reporting units would not have changed our determination that the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value. 
 
 As noted above, ASC 350 also requires that the Company test the indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. Under ASC 350, if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived asset is higher than its fair value, then the asset is deemed to be impaired and the impairment charge is estimated as the excess carrying value over the fair value. The Company calculated the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets using the income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. The relief-from-royalty method is used to estimate the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset who would otherwise have to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. Internally forecasted revenues, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are multiplied by a royalty rate to arrive at the estimated net after tax cost savings. The royalty rate used in the analysis is based on an analysis of empirical, market-derived royalty rates for guideline intangible assets. The net after tax cost savings are discounted using the Discount Rate. The Discount Rate is developed using market observable inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific indefinite lived intangible assets' forecasted performance. The key uncertainties in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the revenue associated with each indefinite-lived intangible asset and the royalty rate. 
 
 During fiscal year 2023, 2022, and 2021 the results indicated all indefinite-lived intangible assets had significant excess of fair value over the carrying value. A reasonably possible change in the estimated revenues associated with the indefinite-lived intangible assets, selected royalty rates or the residual growth rate would not result in an impairment of any of these assets. 
 
 Inventories 
 
 We account for inventory valuation for a majority of the Company using the last-in, first-out LIFO method measured at the lower of cost or market value. We utilize the LIFO method of valuing inventories because it reflects how we monitor and manage our business and it matches current costs and revenues. Valuation of inventory using the LIFO method is made at the end of our fiscal year based on inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs. Other inventories, consisting mostly of foreign inventories, are measured using first-in, first-out FIFO costing methods. Inventory cost, regardless of valuation method, includes direct material, direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs. In circumstances where inventory levels are in excess of anticipated market demand, where inventory is deemed technologically obsolete or not marketable due to its condition or where the inventory cost for an item exceeds its market value, we record a charge to cost of goods sold and reduce the inventory to its market value.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 In the normal course of conducting business, we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions. These risks include fluctuations in interest rates, credit risks, commodity prices, including price fluctuations related to our primary raw materials and foreign currency translation rates. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The Credit Facilities, excluding our Senior Notes, bear interest at a floating rate. On March 15, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the New Senior Secured Term Loan Facility to implement a forward-looking interest rate based on SOFR in lieu of LIBOR, consisting of an applicable margin of 2.00 and a credit spread adjustment of (i) 0.11448 for a one-month interest period, (ii) 0.26161 for a three-month interest period and (iii) 0.42826 for a six-month interest period. Further, on March 24, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the Amended ABL Credit Facility to implement a forward-looking interest rate based on SOFR in lieu of LIBOR consisting of an applicable margin ranging from 1.25 to 1.75 and a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 . As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our net borrowings under the New Senior Secured Term Loan, which were 373.0 million at September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, SOFR exceeded 1.00 ; therefore, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in an approximately 3.8 million change in the annual interest expense on our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. As of September 30, 2023, assuming availability was fully utilized, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in an approximately 3.3 million change in annual interest expense on the ABL Credit Facility. Additionally, if the ABL Credit Facility were fully utilized, the margin we pay on borrowings would increase by 0.3 from the current level and we would incur additional interest expense of 1 million. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 We are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable balances. This risk is mitigated due to our large, diverse customer base. In fiscal 2023, our ten largest customers (including buyers and distributors in buying groups) accounted for approximately 38 of our net sales. As of September 30, 2023, Sonepar USA represented 14 and CED National represented 11 of the Company s accounts receivable, with no significant amounts past due. As of September 30, 2022, one customer, CED National represented 10 of the Company s accounts receivable, with no significant amounts past due. See Note 17, Segment Information to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 
 We maintain provisions for potential credit losses and such losses to date have normally been within our expectations. We evaluate the solvency of our customers on an ongoing basis to determine if additional allowances for doubtful accounts receivable need to be recorded. We have historically not been exposed to a material amount of uncollectible receivable balances. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 We are exposed to price fluctuations for our primary raw material commodities such as steel, copper and PVC resin. Our operating performance may be affected by both upward and downward price fluctuations. We are also exposed to fluctuations in petroleum costs as we deliver a substantial portion of the products we sell by truck. We seek to minimize the effects of inflation and changing prices through economies of purchasing and inventory management resulting in cost reductions and productivity improvements as well as price increases to maintain reasonable gross margins. Such commodity price fluctuations continue to cause volatility in our financial performance and could do so in the future. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further details. 

53 

Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 Because we conduct our business on an international basis in multiple currencies, we may be adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Although we report financial results in United States dollars, approximately 10 of our net sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, particularly British pounds sterling, European euros, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, and New Zealand dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates could therefore significantly affect our reported results from period to period as we translate results in local currencies into United States dollars. With the exception of certain foreign denominated intercompany loans, we generally do not use derivative instruments to hedge translation risks in the ordinary course of business, including the risk related to earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Due to limited cross border transactions, we do not experience material foreign exchange transactional gains or losses.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Atkore Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Atkore Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and shareholders' equity, for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Part IV, Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Solar Tax Credit Accounting Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 Under the United States Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA ), the Company is eligible for certain tax credits related to the manufacturing and selling of components used in the solar energy industry 
 55 

tax credits beginning January 1, 2023. These tax credits are transferable to third parties under the IRA when they meet certain criteria (the transferability criteria ). When credits do not meet the transferability criteria, the benefit is recognized by the Company within income tax expense in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. The Company concluded that fiscal 2023 tax credits do not meet the transferability criteria and, as a result, the Company recognized the benefit of the fiscal 2023 tax credits in its income tax expense. Additionally, the Company has contractual arrangements with some customers who purchase tax credit eligible components to transfer a portion of these tax credits to those customers. In instances where the Company has such arrangements, and the tax credits do not meet the transferability criteria, the Company may transfer the economic value of the agreed upon portion of the tax credits in a manner agreed upon between the Company and the customer. When the Company transfers the economic value of the agreed upon portion of tax credits, the amount is recognized as a reduction of revenue customer rebate ). 
 
 Through September 30, 2023, the Company has recognized a reduction of revenue of 30,401 and a benefit to income tax expense of 39,493. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has recognized a liability of 30,401 for the economic value of these tax credits, and a solar tax credit receivable of 39,493. 
 
 As the IRA was signed into law on August 16, 2022, the tax credits and the related accounting impact was new for the Company in the year ended September 30, 2023. In addition, the Company earned these tax credits beginning January 1, 2023, but were not eligible to transfer these tax credits until after September 30, 2023. The accounting for these tax credits earned, when combined with the fact that the tax credits were not transferable during the year ended September 30, 2023 and the existence of contractual arrangements to transfer the tax credits or the economic value of these tax credits is complex. As a result, we identified the evaluation of the accounting treatment for these tax credits as a critical audit matter due to the complexity of the accounting involved. This required a high degree of auditor judgement as well as an increased extent of audit effort, including the need to involve professionals in our firm having expertise in accounting for income taxes. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

 The Company has certain arrangements that require it to estimate at the time of sale the amounts of variable consideration that should not be recorded as revenue as certain amounts are not expected to be collected from customers, as well as an estimate of the value of products to be returned. The Company principally relies on historical experience, specific customer agreements, and anticipated future trends to estimate these amounts at the time of sale and to reduce the transaction price. These arrangements include sales discounts and allowances, volume rebates, and returned goods. The Company records its obligations related to these items within the Customer Liabilities line on the balance sheet. 
 
 The Company has elected to utilize certain practical expedients available under GAAP. The Company records amounts billed to customers for reimbursement of shipping and handling costs within revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has

 reporting units considering three valuation approaches: (a) the income approach; (b) the guideline public company method; and (c) the comparable transaction method. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital (Discount Rate) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using market observable inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit s forecasted performance. The key uncertainties in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit s forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and EBITDA margins, as well as the perceived risk associated 
 67 

that was allocated from the reporting unit on a relative fair value basis. With the exception of the impairment recorded to the expected sale of the Russia operations, the Company did t record any other goodwill impairments in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021. 

The Company did t record any indefinite-lived asset impairments in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021.

See Note 7, Income Taxes. 
 
 On December 22, 2017, H.R.1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA was signed into law. As part of the enactment of TCJA, the Company recorded a global intangible low-taxed income GILTI provision for the first time beginning in fiscal 2019. The GILTI provision of TCJA requires certain income earned by controlled foreign corporations CFCs to be included currently in the gross income of the CFCs controlling U.S. shareholder. In accordance with accounting standards applicable to income taxes, there is allowed an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred (the period cost method or (2) factoring such amounts into the Company s measurement of its deferred taxes (the deferred method ). The Company has elected the period method. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA was enacted into law. The IRA contains significant tax law changes, including a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15 on adjusted financial statement income, which if applicable for the Company would be effective beginning October 1, 2023, a 1 excise tax on stock repurchases after December 31, 2022, and various tax incentives which include, but are not limited to, credits related to the manufacturing and selling of components used in the solar energy industry which took effect on January 1, 2023. The Company has recognized the benefit of credits related to the manufacturing and selling of components used in the solar energy industry in the income tax provision as described in the previous section discussing Revenue Recognition.

 Insurable Liabilities The Company maintains policies with various insurance companies for its workers compensation, product, property, general, auto, and executive liability risks. The insurance policies that the Company maintains have various retention levels and excess coverage limits. The establishment and update of liabilities for unpaid claims, including claims incurred but not reported, is based on management's estimate as a result of the assessment by the Company's claim administrator of each claim and an independent actuarial valuation of the nature and severity of total claims. The Company utilizes a third-party claims administrator to pay claims, track and evaluate actual claims experience, and ensure consistency in the data used in the actuarial valuation. 
 
 Legal Contingencies Historically, a number of lawsuits have been filed against the Company and the Company has also received other claim demand letters alleging that the Company's anti-microbial coated steel sprinkler pipe, which the Company has not manufactured or sold for several years, is incompatible with chlorinated polyvinyl chloride and caused stress cracking in such pipe manufactured by third parties when installed together in the same sprinkler system, which the Company refers to

 At this time, the Company does not expect the outcome of the Special Products Claims proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and the Company believes that its reserves are adequate for all remaining contingencies for Special Products Claims. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2020, one of the Company s manufacturing facilities experienced a flood which resulted in damages to certain property, plant and equipment. This facility was covered under the Company s property and casualty loss and business interruption insurance policies. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company settled the related insurance claim and received of business interruption recovery proceeds related to this incident. The amount was recorded as other income within the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended September 30, 2021. 
 
 In addition to the matters discussed above, from time to time, the Company is subject to a number of disputes, administrative proceedings and other claims arising out of the ordinary conduct of the Company's business. These matters generally relate to disputes arising out of the use or installation of the Company s products, product liability litigation, contract disputes, patent infringement accusations, employment matters, personal injury claims and similar matters. On the basis of information currently available to the Company, it does not believe that existing proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, litigation is unpredictable, and the Company could incur judgments or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 In disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for product performance and contract completion. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our President and CEO, William E. Waltz, and our Vice President and CFO, David P. Johnson, have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K as required by Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Messrs. Waltz and Johnson have concluded that both the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 No changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 
 The Company s management assessed, under the supervision and with the participation of our President and CEO, William E. Waltz, and our Vice President and CFO, David P. Johnson, the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 
 
 Management s assessment excluded the internal control over financial reporting at Elite Polymer Solutions, which was acquired in fiscal 2023. This company represents 0.6 of total assets (excluding goodwill and intangibles, net), 0.8 of net sales, and 0.1 of net income as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The Company s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting for fiscal 2023.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Atkore Inc. 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Atkore Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023, of the Company and our report dated November 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 
 As described in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Elite Polymer Solutions, which was acquired on November 7, 2022. The total assets (excluding goodwill and intangibles, net which were included in management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023), net sales, and net income of these acquisitions constitute approximately 0.6 , 0.8 and 0.1 , respectively, of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Elite Polymer Solutions. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
 100 

reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The shares of the Corporation shall be uncertificated, except to the extent that the Board has provided by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of the stock of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates. Every holder of stock in the Corporation represented by certificates shall be entitled to have, and the Board may in its sole discretion permit a holder of uncertificated shares to receive upon request, a certificate signed by the appropriate officers of the Corporation, certifying the number and class of shares owned by such holder. Such certificate shall be in such form as the Board may determine, to the extent consistent with applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-laws. 
 Section 1.02 Facsimile Signatures . Any or all signatures on the certificates referred to in Section 5.01 of these By-laws may be in facsimile form. If any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed, or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon, a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. 
 Section 1.03 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates . A new certificate may be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed only upon delivery to the Corporation of an affidavit of the owner or owners (or their legal representatives) of such certificate, setting forth such allegation, and a bond or other undertaking as may be satisfactory to a financial officer of the Corporation designated by the Board to indemnify the Corporation against 
 19 

any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of any such new certificate. 
 Section 1.04 Transfer of Stock . 
 (a) Transfer of shares shall be made on the books of the Corporation upon surrender to the Corporation of a certificate for shares, duly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, and otherwise in compliance with applicable law. Shares that are not represented by a certificate shall be transferred in accordance with applicable law. Subject to applicable law, the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-laws, the Board may prescribe such additional rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate relating to the issue, transfer and registration of shares of the Corporation. 
 (b) The Corporation may enter into agreements with shareholders to restrict the transfer of stock of the Corporation in any manner not prohibited by the DGCL. 
 Section 1.05 Registered Stockholders . Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Corporation may treat the registered owner of any shares of its stock as the person exclusively entitled to receive dividends and other distributions, to vote, to receive notice and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of the owner of the shares, and the Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or legal claim to or interest in such shares on the part of any other person, whether or not the Corporation shall have notice of such claim or interests. If a transfer of shares is made for collateral security, and not absolutely, this fact shall be so expressed in the entry of the transfer if, when the certificates are presented to the Corporation for transfer or uncertificated shares are requested to be transferred, both the transferor and transferee request the Corporation to do so. 
 Section 1.06 Transfer Agent and Registrar . The Board may appoint one or more transfer agents and one or more registrars, and may require all certificates representing shares to bear the signature of any such transfer agents or registrars. 
 Article VI INDEMNIFICATION 
 Section 1.01 Indemnification . 
 (a) In General . The Corporation shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by the DGCL and other applicable law, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each, a proceeding by reason of the fact that x such person is or was serving or has agreed at the request of the Corporation to serve as a director or officer of the Corporation, or y such person, while serving as a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving or has agreed at the request of the Corporation to serve at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, manager or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or z such person is or was serving or has agreed at the request 
 20 

of the Corporation to serve at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer or manager of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted by such person in such capacity, and who satisfies the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or other applicable law 
 (i) in a proceeding other than a proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person or on such person s behalf in connection with such proceeding and any appeal therefrom, or 
 (ii) in a proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person or on such person s behalf in connection with the defense or settlement of such proceeding and any appeal therefrom. 
 (b) Indemnification in Respect of Successful Defense. To the extent that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any proceeding referred to in Section 6.01(a) or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified by the Corporation against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. 
 (c) Indemnification in Respect of Proceedings Instituted by Indemnitee. Section 6.01(a) does not require the Corporation to indemnify a present or former director or officer of the Corporation in respect of a proceeding (or part thereof) instituted by such person on his or her own behalf, unless such proceeding (or part thereof) has been authorized by the Board or the indemnification requested is pursuant to the last sentence of Section 6.03 of these By-laws. 
 Section 1.02 Advance of Expenses . The Corporation shall advance all expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by a present or former director or officer in defending any proceeding prior to the final disposition of such proceeding upon written request of such person and delivery of an undertaking by such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. The Corporation may authorize any counsel for the Corporation to represent (subject to applicable conflict of interest considerations) such present or former director or officer in any proceeding, whether or not the Corporation is a party to such proceeding. 
 Section 1.03 Procedure for Indemnification . Any indemnification under Section 6.01 of these By-laws or any advance of expenses under Section 6.02 of these By-laws shall be made only against a written request therefor (together with supporting documentation) submitted by or on behalf of the person seeking indemnification or advance. Indemnification may be sought by a person under Section 6.01 of these By-laws in respect of a proceeding only to the extent that both the liabilities for which indemnification is sought and all portions of the proceeding relevant to the determination of whether the person has satisfied any appropriate standard of conduct have become 
 21 

final. A person seeking indemnification or advance of expenses may seek to enforce such person s rights to indemnification or advance of expenses (as the case may be) in the Delaware Court of Chancery to the extent all or any portion of a requested indemnification has not been granted within 90 days of, or to the extent all or any portion of a requested advance of expenses has not been granted within 20 days of, the submission of such request. All expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by such person in connection with successfully establishing such person s right to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article, in whole or in part, shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. 
 Section 1.04 Burden of Proof . 
 (a) In any proceeding brought to enforce the right of a person to receive indemnification to which such person is entitled under Section 6.01 of these By-laws, the Corporation has the burden of demonstrating that the standard of conduct applicable under the DGCL or other applicable law was not met. A prior determination by the Corporation (including its Board or any Committee thereof, its independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct does not itself constitute evidence that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 
 (b) In any proceeding brought to enforce a claim for advances to which a person is entitled under Section 6.02 of these By-laws, the person seeking an advance need only show that he or she has satisfied the requirements expressly set forth in Section 6.02 of these By-laws. 
 Section 1.05 Contract Right Non-Exclusivity Survival . 
 (a) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article VI shall be deemed to be separate contract rights between the Corporation and each director and officer who serves in any such capacity at any time while these provisions as well as the relevant provisions of the DGCL are in effect, and no repeal or modification of any of these provisions or any relevant provisions of the DGCL shall adversely affect any right or obligation of such director or officer existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to any state of facts then or previously existing or any proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts. Such contract rights may not be modified retroactively as to any present or former director or officer without the consent of such director or officer. 
 (b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other indemnification or advancement of expenses to which a present or former director or officer of the Corporation seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled by any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. 
 (c) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article VI to any present or former director or officer of the Corporation shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person. 
 22 

Section 1.06 Insurance . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to become a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person or on such person s behalf in any such capacity, or arising out of such person s status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article. 
 Section 1.07 Employees and Agents . The Board, or any officer authorized by the Board generally or in the specific case to make indemnification decisions, may cause the Corporation to indemnify any present or former employee or agent of the Corporation in such manner and for such liabilities as the Board may determine, up to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and other applicable law. 
 Section 1.08 Interpretation Severability . Terms defined in Sections 145(h) or (i) of the DGCL have the meanings set forth in such sections when used in this Article VI. If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director or officer of the Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
