Results
of Operations 

During
the year ended September 30, 2022, we generated no revenues. We generated 182,140 in passive revenues during the period ending September
30, 2023. Our operating expenses for the same periods were comprised of general and administrative expenses of 165,362 and 108,205,
respectively, resulting in net income of 23,778 for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to a net loss of 108,205 for the year
ended September 30, 2022. Our general and administrative expenses consisted of mainly professional fees for the year ended September
30, 2023, and the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase of general and administrative expenses was mainly due to the increase of
salaries and wages, rent, and professional fees. 

Our
total assets as of September 30, 2023 were 179,828. 

As
of September 30, 2023, the Company had 67,139,990 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 

As
of September 30, 2023 and 2022, there were total debts of 679,000 and 579,000 respectively, due to related parties. These debts are
interest free, unsecured and payable on demand. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
for the year ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a negative cash flow of 59,305 and 72,049, respectively. The Company's
principal sources and uses of funds were as follows: 

For
the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company used 59,305 in cash for operations as compared to 72,049 for the year ended September
30, 2022, respectively. Such decrease was primarily due to lower net loss in year ended September 30, 2023. The net cash provided
by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2023 was 200,090, as compared to zero for the year ended September 30, 2022.
Such increase was a result of capital raised from the issuance of common shares. 

The
Company's financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company's liquidity and capital needs relate primarily to working
capital and other general corporate requirements. As of September 30, 2023, we had 149,614 in cash and the outstanding liabilities were
 702,847. As of September 30, 2022 we had cash of 8,829 and there were outstanding liabilities of 771,167. Stockholders deficits were
 538,470 and 762,338, for September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These factors raise concerns about our ability to continue as a
going concern, as discussed in the footnotes to our financial statements. However, the company s management team has established
a new plan for financing the Company s operations in the short run, consisting of financial support by our current shareholders
and management. The Company is currently working with other entities to develop a new business plan. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arran g ements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that is material to investors.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Summit Networks Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Summit Networks Inc (the Company as of September 30, 2023 and
2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' deficit and cash flows for each of the two years ended September
30, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements and schedule (collectively, the financial statements).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September
30, 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern 

As
discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company had limited operations during the period from July 8, 2014 (date of inception)
to September 30, 2023 resulting in accumulated deficit of 1,194,477 and has not generated any revenue. There is no guarantee that Company
will generate revenue and net income in the future. At September 30, 2023, the Company had a working capital deficiency of 538,470.
The cash used in operating activities were 59,305. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability
to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the accompanying financial
statements. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

ITEM
9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

None. 

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

At
the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the
participation of our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer of the effectiveness of
the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and Rule 15d 15(e)
under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer
and the Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that: (i)
information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and
(ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective due primarily to a material weakness in the segregation of duties in the Company s internal
control of financial reporting as discussed below. 

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company (including its consolidated
subsidiaries) and all related information appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our internal control over financial reporting
is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Management
conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered
by this report, based on the criteria in a framework developed by the Company s management pursuant to and in compliance with the
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO)
of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness
of controls, walkthroughs of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management
has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, because management identified a material weakness
in the Company s internal control over financial reporting related to the segregation of duties as described below. 

While
the Company does adhere to internal controls and processes that were designed and implemented based on the COSO report, it is difficult
with a very limited staff to maintain appropriate segregation of duties in the initiating and recording of transactions, thereby creating
a segregation of duties weakness. Due to: (i) the significance of segregation of duties to the preparation of reliable financial statements;
(ii) the significance of potential misstatement that could have resulted due to the deficient controls; and (iii) the absence of sufficient
other mitigating controls, we determined that this control deficiency resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement
or lack of disclosure within the annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented or detected. 

- 19 - 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives . 

Management
has evaluated, and continues to evaluate, avenues for mitigating our internal controls weaknesses, but mitigating controls to completely
mitigate internal control weaknesses have been deemed to be impractical and prohibitively costly, due to the size of our organization
at the current time. Management expects to continue to use reasonable care in following and seeking improvements to effective internal
control processes that have been and continue to be in use at the Company. 

Changes
in internal controls over financial reporting 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred prior to the Company s most recent
financial quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting.

Director
Independence 

Our
company has three independent directors and all directors are also served as members of the audit committee. 

The
Board and Committees 

Our
Company does not have separately designated standing audit, nominating or compensation committees in place. Instead, our Company's entire
board of directors has served, and currently serves, in that capacity. This is due to the small number of executive officers involved
with the Company and the fact that the Company operates with few employees. Our board of directors will continue to evaluate, from time
to time, whether a separately designated standing audit committee should be put in place. We do not have an audit committee financial
expert as that term is defined by the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We currently have limited working
capital and limited revenues. Management does not believe that is would be in our best interests at this time to retain independent directors
to sit on an audit, nominating or compensation committee. If we are able to generate sufficient revenues in the future, then we will
likely seek out and retain independent directors and form an audit committee. 

We
have not adopted practices or polices regarding employee, officer and director hedging in accordance with Item 407(i) of Regulation S-K. 

Legal
Proceedings 

To
the knowledge of our management, there are no material proceedings to which any of our directors, officers or affiliates are a party
adverse to our Company. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
intend at some point to adopt a code of ethics that applies to our officers, directors and employees. We will file copies of our code
of ethics in a current report on Form 8-K. You will be able to review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SEC's website
at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of the code of ethics will be provided without charge upon request to us. We intend to disclose any
amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our code of ethics in a current report on Form 8-K. 

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

There
are no current employment agreements between us and our directors and officers. We have never paid any compensation to any of our executive
officers or directors. Our current officers have agreed to work with no remuneration until such time as we receive sufficient revenues
necessary to provide management salaries. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate when sufficient revenues will occur that will allow
us to begin paying this compensation, or what the amount of the compensation will be. The Company currently has no annuity, pension or
retirement benefits proposed to be paid to our officers, directors or employees.
