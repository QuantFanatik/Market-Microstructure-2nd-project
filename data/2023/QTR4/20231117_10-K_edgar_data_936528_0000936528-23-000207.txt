Its principal expenses are interest paid on deposits, credit costs, general and administrative expenses, interest on borrowings and income taxes. 
 
 The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (the "WDFI"), its primary state regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB") and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), which insures its deposits up to applicable limits.

Lending Programs and Policies. The Bank's lending activities include commercial and consumer loans, including the following loan categories. 
 Multi-family residential loans . Multi-family residential (five or more dwelling units) loans generally are secured by multi-family rental properties, such as apartment buildings. In underwriting multi-family residential loans, the Bank considers a number of factors, which include the projected net cash flow to the loan's debt service requirement, the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower's experience in owning or managing similar properties. Multi-family residential loans are originated in amounts up to 80 of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. 
 Loans secured by multi-family residential real estate generally involve different credit risk than single-family residential loans and carry larger loan balances. This different credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic and societal conditions on income-producing properties, the primary source of cash flow for repayment being spread across multiple tenants, the effects of government orders such as eviction forbearance and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Repayment of loans secured by multi-family mortgages typically depends upon the successful operation of the related real estate property. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. The Bank seeks to minimize these risks through its underwriting policies, which require such loans to be qualified at origination on the basis of the property's income and debt service ratio. 
 It is the Bank's policy to obtain title insurance ensuring that it has a valid first lien on the mortgaged real estate serving as collateral for the loan. Borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance prior to closing and, when required by regulation, flood insurance. Borrowers may be required to advance funds on a monthly basis, together with each payment of principal and interest, to a mortgage escrow account from which the Bank makes disbursements for items such as real estate taxes, hazard insurance premiums and private mortgage insurance premiums when due. 
 Commercial and industrial loans . The Bank makes various types of business loans to customers in its market area for working capital, acquiring real estate, equipment or other business purposes, such as acquisitions. The terms of these loans generally range from less than one year to a maximum of ten years. The loans are either negotiated on a fixed-rate basis or carry adjustable interest rates indexed to the Secured Overnight Funding Rate ("SOFR"), Prime Rate or another market rate. 
 
 Commercial loans are made based upon assessment of the borrower's ability and willingness to repay along with an evaluation of secondary repayment sources such as the value and marketability of collateral. Most such loans are extended to closely held businesses and the personal guaranty of the principal is usually obtained. Commercial loans have a relatively high risk of default compared to residential real estate loans. Pricing of commercial loans is based on the credit risk of the borrower with consideration given to the overall relationship of the borrower, including deposits and contributed equity/loan-to-value ratio. The acquisition of business deposits is an important focus of this business line. The Bank provides a full line of treasury management products to support the depository needs of its clients. 
 Construction loans . The Bank originates construction loans to finance construction of single-family and multi-family residences as well as commercial properties. Loans made to builders are generally tied to an interest rate index and normally have maturities of two years or less or are structured such that they convert to a permanent loan after the completion of construction or stabilization of the property. Loans made to individuals for construction of their home generally are 30-year fixed rate loans. The Bank's policies provide that for residential construction loans, loans may be made for 85 or less of the construction cost or 80 of the appraised value of the property upon completion, whichever is less. As a result of activity over the past four decades, the Bank believes that builders of single-family residences in its primary market areas consider the Bank to be a construction lender of choice. Because of this history, the Bank has developed a staff with in-depth land development and construction experience and working relationships with selected builders based on their operating histories and financial stability. 
 Construction lending involves a higher level of risk than single-family residential lending due to the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers and the effects of general economic conditions in the home building industry. Moreover, a construction loan can involve additional risks because of the complexities of completing the construction, the inherent difficulty in estimating both the cost (including interest) of the project and the property's value at completion of the project. 
 Land development loans . The Bank's land development loans are of a short-term nature and are generally made for 75 or less of the appraised value of the unimproved property. Funds are disbursed periodically at various stages of completion as authorized by the Bank's personnel. The interest rate on these loans typically adjust daily or monthly in accordance with a designated index. 
 Land development loans involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on owner-occupied real estate. Mitigation of risk of loss on a land development loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property's 
 8 

value at completion of development compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of development and the financial strength of the borrower. 
 Permanent land loans . The Bank's permanent land loans (also called consumer lot loans) are generally made on improved land, with the intent of building a primary or secondary residence. These loans are limited to 70 or less of the appraised value of the property, up to a maximum loan amount of 700,000. The interest rate on permanent land loans is generally fixed for 20 years. 
 Single-family residential loans . The Bank originates 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans secured by single-family residences. Moreover, it is the Bank's general policy to include in the documentation evidencing its conventional mortgage loans a due-on-sale clause, which facilitates adjustment of interest rates on such loans when the property securing the loan is sold or transferred. 
 All of the Bank's mortgage lending is subject to written, nondiscriminatory underwriting standards, loan origination procedures and lending policies approved by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"). Property valuations are required on all real estate loans. Appraisals are prepared by independent appraisers, reviewed by staff of the Bank, and approved by the Bank's management. Property evaluations are sometimes utilized in lieu of appraisals on single-family real estate loans of 250,000 or less and are reviewed by the Bank's staff. Detailed loan applications are obtained to determine the borrower's ability to repay and the more significant items on these applications are verified through the use of credit reports, financial statements or written confirmations. 
 Depending on the size of the loan involved, a varying number of officers of the Bank must approve the loan application before the loan can be granted. Federal guidelines limit the amount of a real estate loan made to a specified percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, as determined by an evaluation at the time the loan is originated. This is referred to as the loan-to-value ratio. The Board sets the maximum loan-to-value ratios for each type of real estate loan offered by the Bank. 
 When establishing general reserves for loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80 that are not insured by private mortgage insurance, the Bank considers the additional risk inherent in these products, as well as their relative loan loss experience, and provides reserves when deemed appropriate. The total balance for loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80 at origination as of September 30, 2023, was 271,020,000, with allocated reserves of 2,442,000. 
 Consumer loans . The Bank's non-mortgage consumer loan portfolio consists of prime quality student loans acquired from an independent financial investment firm that retains 1 of each loan, plus various other non-mortgage consumer loans including personal lines of credit and credit cards. 
 
 Home equity loans . The Bank extends revolving lines of credit to consumers that are secured by a first or second mortgage on a single-family residence. The interest rate on these loans adjusts monthly indexed to prime. Total loan-to-value ratios when combined with any underlying first liens held by the Bank are limited to 85 or less. Total loan-to-value ratios are limited to 80 or less when underlying first liens are held by any other investor. Loan terms are a ten-year draw period followed by a fifteen year amortization period. 
 Origination and Purchase of Loans. The Bank has general authority to lend anywhere in the United States; however, its primary lending areas are within the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. Loan originations come from a variety of sources. Residential loan originations result from referrals from real estate brokers, walk-in customers, purchasers of property in connection with builder projects that are financed by the Bank, mortgage brokers and refinance activity for existing customers. Business purpose loans are obtained primarily by direct solicitation of borrowers and ongoing relationships. 
 
 The Bank also purchases loans and mortgage-backed securities when lending rates and mortgage volume for new loan originations in its market area do not fulfill its needs.

 Interest Rates, Loan Fees and Service Charges. Interest rates charged by the Bank on mortgage loans are primarily determined by the competitive loan rates offered in its lending areas and in the secondary market. Mortgage loan rates reflect factors such as general interest rates, the supply of money available to the industry and the demand for such loans. General economic conditions, the regulatory programs and policies of federal and state agencies, including the Federal Reserve Bank s monetary policies, changes in tax laws and governmental budgetary programs influence these factors. 
 The Bank receives fees for originating loans in addition to various fees and charges related to existing loans, including prepayment charges, late charges and assumption fees. In making one-to-four- family home mortgage loans, the Bank normally charges an origination fee and as part of the loan application, the borrower pays the Bank for out-of-pocket costs, such as the appraisal fee, whether or not the borrower closes the loan. The interest rate charged is normally the prevailing rate at the time the loan application is approved and accepted. In the case of construction loans, the Bank normally charges an origination fee. Loan origination fees and other terms of multi-family residential loans are individually negotiated.

Investment Activities 
 The Bank is obligated by its regulators to maintain adequate liquidity and does so by holding cash and cash equivalents and by investing in securities. These investments may include, among other things, certain certificates of deposit, repurchase agreements, bankers acceptances, loans to financial institutions whose deposits are federally-insured, federal funds, United States government and agency obligations and mortgage-backed securities. 
 
 Sources of Funds 
 
 General. Deposits are the primary source of the Bank s funds for use in lending and other general business purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank derives funds from loan repayments, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB"), borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB"), and from investment repayments and sales. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are influenced by general interest rates, money market conditions, the availability of FDIC insurance and the market perception of the Company s financial stability. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in normal sources of funds, such as deposit inflows at lower than projected levels. Borrowings may also be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded activities and to manage interest rate risk. Borrowing capacity and availability is influenced by interest rates, market conditions, availability of collateral and the market's perception of the Bank's financial stability. 
 
 Deposits. The Bank relies on a mix of deposit types, including business and personal checking accounts, term certificates of deposit, and other savings deposit alternatives that have no fixed term, such as money market accounts and passbook savings accounts. The Bank offers several consumer checking account products, both interest bearing and non-interest bearing and three business checking accounts, two of which target small businesses with relatively simple and straightforward banking needs and one for larger, more complex business depositors with an account that prices monthly based on the volume and type of activity. Savings and money market accounts are offered to both businesses and consumers, with interest paid after certain threshold amounts are exceeded. 
 
 The Bank s deposits are obtained primarily from residents of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. 
 
 Borrowings. The Bank has a credit line with the FHLB for up to 45 of total assets, subject to availability of collateral. The Bank obtains advances from the FHLB based upon the security of the FHLB capital stock it owns and certain of its loans, provided certain standards related to credit worthiness have been met. Such advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities, and the FHLB prescribes acceptable uses to which the advances pursuant to each program may be put, as well as limitations on the size of such advances. Depending on the program, such limitations are based either on a fixed percentage of assets or the Company's credit worthiness. FHLB advances are used to meet seasonal and other withdrawals of deposit accounts and to fund expansion of the Bank's lending. 
 The Bank may need to borrow funds for short periods of time to meet day-to-day financing needs. In these instances, funds are borrowed from other financial institutions or the Federal Reserve Bank, for periods generally ranging from one to seven days at the then current borrowing rate. The Bank has elected to utilize the FRB's Bank Term Funding program (the "BTFP") to leverage its highly favorable terms to fortify the Bank's liquidity position. These borrowings are repayable at any time without penalty and are the lowest cost funding source available. 
 For further information on these activities, see Note L to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

Additional information will be provided in the Company s forthcoming 2023 Community and Social Responsibility Report which will be made available on the Company s website. Nothing on our website, including the aforementioned report, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. 
 The Company 
 
 General. The Company is registered as a bank holding company and is subject to regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve Bank. 
 Regulation. The Company operates in a highly regulated industry. The regulatory structure governing the Company s operations is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers, and not to benefit our shareholders. As part of this regulatory structure, the Company is subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Under this structure, regulators have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the Company s operations if they determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. 
 
 Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in a range of sanctions and enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil money penalties, formal agreements and cease and desist orders. In order to ensure the Bank's programs and operations are in compliance with regulatory requirements, the Bank has and will continue to incur additional significant costs in order to bring programs and operations into compliance. 
 
 For further information on regulatory matters, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data as well as the "Risk Factors" section of this report and the "USA Patriot Act of 2001" discussion below. 
 
 Sections below include a description of certain laws and regulations that relate to the regulation of the Company and the Bank. The description of these laws and regulations, and descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. 
 
 Restrictions on Activities and Acquisitions. Bank holding companies are subject to a variety of restrictions on their activities and the acquisitions they can make. Generally, the activities or acquisition of a bank holding company that is not a financial holding company are limited to those that constitute banking or managing or controlling banks or which are closely related to 
 14 

banking. In addition, without the prior approval of the FRB, bank holding companies are generally prohibited from acquiring more than 5 of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, taking any action that causes a bank to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company, acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of a bank, or merging with another bank holding company. 
 
 Control of Company or Bank. Pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act, (the CIBC Act individuals, corporations or other entities acquiring Company equity interests may, alone or together with other investors, be deemed to control a holding company or a bank. If an acquisition is deemed to constitute control of the holding company or bank and is not subject to approval under the Bank Holding Company Act or certain other statutes, such person or group will be required to file a notice under the CIBC Act. Generally, ownership of, or power to vote, more than 25 of any class of voting securities constitutes control. In the case of a bank or bank holding company the securities of which are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), ownership of or power to vote more than 10 of any class of voting securities creates a presumption of control. 
 
 Source of Strength. Under long-standing FRB policy, a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and management strength to its subsidiary bank. Under this policy, a bank holding company is expected to stand ready to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary bank during periods of financial adversity and to maintain financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to assist its subsidiary bank. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine by adopting a statutory provision requiring, among other things, that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary banks. 
 
 Restrictions on Company Dividends. The Company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is affected by several factors. Since the Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and its subsidiaries and does not have significant operations of its own, the Company may not be able to pay dividends to its shareholders if the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company. The Bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to various regulatory restrictions. 
 
 In addition, the Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to rules and policies of the FRB. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the company s expected future needs and financial condition. Capital rules adopted by the Federal Reserve, effective January 2015, may limit the Company s ability to pay dividends if the Company fails to meet certain requirements under the rules. In addition, if we do not or are unable to pay quarterly dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, we may not pay a dividend to the holders of our Common Stock. 
 
 See Washington Federal Bank, wholly-owned operating subsidiary - Restrictions on Dividends . 
 
 Since the Company is a Washington state corporation, it is also subject to restrictions under Washington corporate law relating to dividends. Generally, under Washington law, a corporation may not pay a dividend if, after giving effect to the dividend, the corporation would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due in the ordinary course of business or the corporation s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus (with some exceptions) the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend payment, to satisfy the dissolution preferences of senior equity securities. 

Washington Federal Bank, wholly-owned operating subsidiary 
 
 General. The Bank is a federally-insured Washington state chartered commercial bank dba WaFd Bank. The Bank is a member of the FDIC and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits of the Depository Insurance Fund DIF ), which is administered by the FDIC. As a result, the FDIC has certain regulatory and examination authority over the Bank. 
 
 Regulation. The WDFI and FDIC have extensive authority over the operations of the Bank. As part of this authority, the Bank is required to file periodic reports with the WDFI and FDIC and is subject to periodic examinations by the WDFI and FDIC. As a Washington State chartered commercial bank with branches in the States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, the Bank is subject not only to the applicable laws and regulations of Washington State, but is also subject to the applicable laws and regulations of these other states in which it does business. Various laws and regulations prescribe the investment and lending authority of the Bank, and the Bank is prohibited from engaging in any activities not permitted by such laws and regulations. While the Bank has broad authority to engage in all types of lending activities, a variety of restrictions apply to certain other investments by the Bank. 
 
 Interstate Banking . Subject to certain limitations and restrictions, a bank holding company, with prior approval of the FRB, may acquire an out-of-state bank; banks in states that do not prohibit out-of-state mergers may merge with the approval of the 
 15 

appropriate federal banking agency, and a bank may establish a de novo branch out of state if such branching is permitted by the other state for state banks chartered by such other state. 
 
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum amount of federal deposit insurance coverage was permanently increased from 100,000 to 250,000 per depositor, per institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act raised the minimum designated reserve ratio, which the FDIC is required to set each year for the DIF, to 1.35 . The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The FDIC has established a higher reserve ratio of 2 as a long-term goal beyond what is required by statute. 
 
 Brokered Deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act prohibits an insured depository institution from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless it is well-capitalized or is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A depository institution that is adequately capitalized and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of national and local rate caps set by the FDIC and published on its website. 
 
 Transactions with Affiliates; Insider Loans. Under current federal law, all transactions between and among a bank and its affiliates, including holding companies, are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder. Generally, these requirements limit extensions of credit and certain other such transactions by the bank to affiliates to a percentage of the institution's capital and generally such transactions must be collateralized. Generally, all affiliate transactions must be on terms at least as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, a bank may not lend to any affiliate engaged in non-banking activities that are not permissible for a bank holding company or acquire shares of any affiliate that is not a subsidiary. Federal law authorizes the imposition of additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates if necessary to protect the safety and soundness of a bank. 
 
 Extensions of credit by a bank to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders are subject to Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, generally prohibits loans to any such individual where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15 of an institution's unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional 10 of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Section 22(h) permits loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to employees of a subject bank provided that no preference is given to any officer, director or principal shareholder, or related interest thereto, over any other employee. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to all insiders cannot exceed the institution's unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. 
 
 The affiliate transaction rules in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act broaden the definition of affiliate and apply these rules to securities lending, repurchase agreements and derivatives. These rules also strengthen collateral requirements and limit Federal Reserve exemptive authority. Further, the definition of extension of credit for transactions with executive officers, directors and principal shareholders includes credit exposure arising from a derivative transaction, a repurchase or reverse repurchase agreement or a securities lending or borrowing transaction. These provisions have not had a material effect on the Company or the Bank. 
 
 Restrictions on Dividends. The amount of dividends payable by the Bank to the Company depends upon its earnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies, including the capital conservation buffer requirement. Federal law further provides that no insured depository institution may make any capital distribution (which includes a cash dividend) if, after making the distribution, the institution would be undercapitalized, as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. In addition, under Washington law, no bank may declare or pay any dividend in an amount greater than its retained earnings without the prior approval of the WDFI. WDFI also has the power to require any bank to suspend the payment of any and all dividends. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs that provide funding to their members for making home mortgage loans, as well as loans for affordable housing and community development. Each FHLB serves members within its assigned region and is funded primarily through proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. Loans are made to members in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. At September 30, 2023, FHLB advances to the Bank amounted to 2,900,000,000. As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Des 
 16 

Moines. At September 30, 2023, the Bank held 126,820,000 in FHLB of Des Moines stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. 
 
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. Banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") and related regulations of the FDIC to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act (together, the "Fair Lending Laws") prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. An institution's failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities. Failure to comply with the Fair Lending Laws could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, the CFPB and other federal regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice. 
 
 USA Patriot Act of 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 ("Patriot Act"), through amendments to the federal Bank Secrecy Act BSA ), substantially broadened the scope of United States anti money-laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial scope of United States jurisdiction. The United States Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations under the Patriot Act that apply to financial institutions such as the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate risk-based programs reasonably designed to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply satisfactorily with all relevant Patriot Act and BSA requirements, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 
 
 Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020. The Anti-Money Laundering act of 2020 AML Act was enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act and requires the U.S. Treasury Department to issue National Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Priorities, which occurred in June 2021. The AML Act also includes a requirement to conduct studies and issue regulations that may alter some of the due diligence, recordkeeping and reporting requirements that the BSA and Patriot Act impose on financial institutions. The AML Act also promotes increased information-sharing and use of technology and increases penalties for violations of the BSA and includes whistleblower incentives, both of which could increase the prospect of regulatory enforcement. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements. Bank holding companies and federally insured banks are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital. The Federal Reserve establishes capital standards applicable to all bank holding companies, and the WDFI and FDIC establish capital standards applicable to Washington state chartered, non-member banks. The capital rules reflect, in part, certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010 (which standards are commonly referred to as Basel III as well as requirements contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act. 
 
 The capital rules require a capital ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk based assets. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments (subject to certain adjustments) as well as accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI except to the extent that the Company and the Bank exercise a one-time irrevocable option to exclude certain components of AOCI, which the Company and the Bank have done. Tier 1 capital also includes non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and limited amounts of minority interests. Regulatory deductions from capital include goodwill and intangible assets. The capital rules prescribe the manner in which certain capital elements are determined, including but not limited to, requiring certain deductions related to mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and supplementary capital. Supplementary capital consists of certain capital instruments that do not qualify as core capital as well as general valuation loan and lease loss allowances up to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets. Supplementary capital may be used to satisfy the risk-based requirement only in an amount equal to the amount of Tier 1 capital. 
 
 In determining the required amount of risk-based capital, total assets, including certain off-balance-sheet items, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor based on the risks inherent in the type of assets held by an institution. The risk categories range from 0 for low-risk assets such as U.S. Treasury securities and GNMA securities to 1,250 for various types of loans and other assets deemed to be of higher risk. Single-family residential loans having loan-to-value ratios not exceeding 90 and meeting certain additional criteria, as well as certain multi-family residential loans, qualify for a 50 risk-weight treatment. The book value of each asset is multiplied by the risk factor applicable to the asset category, and the sum of the products of this calculation equals total risk-weighted assets. The rules set forth the methods of calculating certain risk-based assets, which in turn affects the calculation of risk-based ratios. Higher or more sensitive risk weights are assigned to various categories of assets, among which are commercial real estate, credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credit that are 90 days past due or are nonaccrual, foreign exposures, certain corporate exposures, securitization exposures, equity exposures and in certain cases mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets.

Both the Company and the Bank are required to have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 . In addition, both the Company and the Bank are required to have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 6.0 and a total risk-based ratio of 8.0 . Both the Company and the Bank are required to establish a conservation buffer, consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital, equal to 2.5 . The capital conservation buffer is designed to ensure that banks build up capital buffers outside periods of stress, which can be drawn down as losses are incurred. An institution that does not meet the conservation buffer will be subject to restrictions on certain activities including payment of dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. 
 
 The Federal Reserve and the FDIC are also authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis. Management believes that the current capital levels of the Company and the Bank are sufficient to be in compliance with the fully phased-in standards under the rules. 
 
 Any bank holding company or bank that fails to meet the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement actions. Such actions could include a capital directive, a cease and desist or consent order, civil money penalties, restrictions on an institution's operations and/or the appointment of a conservator or receiver. FRB and WDFI capital regulations provide that such supervisory actions, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, could require one or more of a variety of corrective actions. 
 
 For information regarding compliance with each of these capital requirements by the Company and the Bank as of September 30, 2023, see Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof. 
 
 Prompt Corrective Action. Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution s category depends upon its capital levels in relation to relevant capital measures, which include a risk-based capital measure, a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework. 
 
 The prompt corrective action rules, which apply to the Bank but not the Company, are modified to include a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio and to increase certain other capital requirements for the various thresholds. For example, the requirements for the Bank to be considered well-capitalized under the rules are a 5.0 Tier 1 leverage ratio, a 6.5 common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio, an 8.0 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 10.0 total risk-based capital ratio. To be adequately capitalized, those ratios are 4.0 , 4.5 . 6.0 and 8.0 , respectively. 
 
 An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits, generally. Any institution that is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. Federal law authorizes the FDIC to reclassify a well-capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category. The FDIC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized. As of September 30, 2023, the Bank exceeded the requirements of a well-capitalized institution. 
 
 Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests ("DFAST"). On July 6, 2018, bank regulatory agencies (the FRB, FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) issued a joint interagency statement regarding the impact of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act ("EGRRCPA") on financial institutions. The EGRRCPA gave immediate relief from stress testing for applicable bank holding companies but not financial institutions until November 25, 2019. Pursuant to direction from the Bank's regulators, the Bank was provided similar relief and is no longer required to submit company-run annual stress tests. Notwithstanding these amendments to the stress testing requirements, the federal banking agencies indicated through interagency guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than 100 billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process. Although the Bank will continue to monitor its capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators, the Bank will no longer conduct company-run stress testing as a result of the legislative and regulatory amendments. The Bank continues to use customized stress testing to support the business and as part of its risk management and capital planning process. 
 
 EGRRCPA also enacted several important changes in some technical compliance areas that we believe will help reduce our regulatory burden, including: 
 
 Prohibiting federal banking regulators from imposing higher capital standards on High Volatility Commercial Real Estate HVCRE exposures unless they are for acquisition, development or construction ADC ), and clarifying ADC status; 
 18 

Exempting from appraisal requirements certain transactions involving real property in rural areas and valued at less than 400,000; and 
 Directing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to provide guidance on the applicability of the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule to mortgage assumption transactions and construction-to-permanent home loans, as well the extent to which lenders can rely on model disclosures that do not reflect recent regulatory changes. 
 
 Despite the improvements for mid-size financial institutions such as the Company that has resulted from EGRRCPA, many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations remain in place and will continue to result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation. In addition, the EGRRCPA requires the enactment of a number of implementing regulations, the details of which may have a material effect on the ultimate impact of the law. 

Cybersecurity. The federal banking agencies have established certain expectations with respect to an institution's information security and cybersecurity programs, with an increasing focus on risk management, processes related to information technology and operational resiliency, and the use of third parties in the provision of financial services. In January 2020, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a statement reminding supervised financial institutions of sound cybersecurity risk management principles that expanded on areas articulated in the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards written in Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Sections 501 and 505(b) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. 
 
 State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which the Company operates. 
 
 In November 2021, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a rule regarding notification requirements for banking organizations related to significant computer security incidents. Under the final rule, a bank holding company, such as the Company, and an FDIC-supervised insured depository institution, such as the Bank, are required to notify the Federal Reserve or FDIC, respectively, within 36 hours of incidents that have materially disrupted or degraded, or are reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization s ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization, or impact the stability of the financial sector. Service providers are required under the rule to notify any affected bank client it provides services to as soon as possible when it determines it has experienced a computer-security incident that has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, covered services provided by that entity to the Bank for four or more hours. 
 
 In July 2023, the SEC adopted rules requiring registrants to disclose material cybersecurity incidents experienced and describe the material aspects of their nature, scope and timing. The rules, which supersede their previously interpretive guidance published in February 2018, also require annual disclosures describing a company's cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. These SEC rules, and any other regulatory guidance, are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations. 

Taxation 
 
 In addition to federal income tax, the Company is also subject to income, franchise, excise or gross receipts tax in states (and some cities) where the Company has branches or is deemed to have sufficient nexus for tax purposes. The Company generally files consolidated federal and state income tax returns with its subsidiaries. 
 
 The Company's federal income tax returns are open and subject to potential examination by the IRS for fiscal year 2020 and later. 

Competition 
 
 We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include other banks, savings associations, community banks, credit unions and other financial intermediaries, and new market participants offering services similar to those that we 
 19 

offer. We compete with some competitors within our geographic market area, and with others on a product specific basis, such as the residential mortgage market. Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to provide first-rate, friendly and professional customer service and deliver the banking solutions that our customers want and need. We are also dependent upon our ability to attract and retain employees while managing compensation and other costs.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Ownership of our Common Stock involves risk. Investors should carefully consider, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors. The risks described below may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks we face; additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently considered to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business. 
 
 Operational Risks 
 
 Fluctuating interest rates could adversely affect our business. 
 
 Significant increases in market interest rates on loans, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect both our ability to originate new loans and our ability to grow. Beginning early in 2022, in response to growing signs of inflation, the Federal Reserve Bank has increased interest rates rapidly and the federal funds rate currently sits at a 22-year high. Although the FRB left its benchmark rates steady in September and November of 2023, the FRB suggested that additional rate increases in the future may be necessary to mitigate inflationary pressures. Rapid changes in interest rates make it difficult for the Bank to balance its loan and deposit portfolios, which may adversely affect our results of operations by, for example, reducing asset yields or spreads, creating operating and system issues, or having other adverse impacts on our business. The increased market interest rates could also adversely affect the ability of our floating-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. 
 
 Further, our profitability is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income, which is the difference (or spread between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is a function of the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the amounts of the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by such external factors as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (the FOMC and market interest rates. Furthermore, movements in interest rates, the pace at which such movements occur and the volume and mix of our interest-bearing assets and liabilities influence the level of net interest income. The cost of customer deposits is largely based on short-term interest rates, the level of which is driven by the FOMC. However, the yields generated by long-term loans, such as single-family residential and multifamily mortgage loans, and securities are typically driven by longer-term (10 year) interest rates, which are set by the market and vary from day to day. Further, recent changes in the Federal Reserve Bank's purchase of assets, commonly known as "quantitative easing," have created significant volatility in market interest rates and recent, rapid increases in federal benchmark rates and additional increases in such rates are creating additional uncertainty and making it more difficult for us to balance our loan and deposit portfolios. 
 
 As a result of the high interest rates, our interest expense on both deposits and borrowings has increased significantly. Because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread, and, in turn, our profitability. For example, if the interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on interest-earning assets, the result could be a reduction in our net interest income and with it, a reduction in earnings. The same could be true if interest rates on interest-earning assets decline faster than the rates on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income and earnings would be similarly impacted were the interest rates on interest-earning assets to decline more quickly than the interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, changes in interest rates could affect the Bank's ability to originate loans and attract and retain deposits; the fair values of its securities and other financial assets; the fair values of its liabilities; and the average lives of its loan and securities portfolios. Additionally, decreases in interest rates could lead to increased loan refinancing activity, which, in turn, would alter the balance of our interest-earning assets and impact net interest income. Increases in interest rates could reduce loan refinancing activity, which could result in compression of the spread between loan yields and more quickly rising funding rates. We may also be exposed to movements in market rates to a degree not experienced by other financial institutions, as a result of our significant portfolio of fixed-rate single-family home loans, which are longer-term in nature than the customer accounts and borrowed money that constitute our liabilities. 
 
 We are currently anticipating that there will be further increases in the target federal funds rate in 2024 to combat recent inflationary trends; however, if interest rates do not rise, or if the Federal Reserve were to rapidly lower the target federal funds rate, the reduction in rates could continue to constrain our interest rate spread and may adversely affect our business forecasts. On the other hand, increases in interest rates, to combat inflation or otherwise, may result in a change in the mix of noninterest and interest-bearing accounts. All else being equal, if the interest rates on the Company's interest-bearing liabilities 
 21 

increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-earning assets, the result would be a reduction in net interest income and with it, a reduction in net earnings. We are unable to predict changes in interest rates, which are affected by factors beyond our control, including inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply and other changes in financial markets. 
 
 Inflationary pressures and rising prices may affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Inflation rates remained elevated in 2023 however we did see a decrease from the highs seen in 2022. Inflation pressures are currently expected to remain elevated throughout 2023 and are likely to continue into 2024 as the inflation rate remains above the Federal Reserve Bank s target rate of 2 . Inflation has led to increased costs to our customers, making it more difficult for them to repay their loans or other obligations increasing our credit risk. Sustained higher interest rates by the Federal Reserve may be needed to tame persistent inflationary price pressures, which could push down asset prices and weaken economic activity. A deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and our markets could result in a further increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services, all of which, in turn, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Company s pending merger with Luther Burbank Corporation may expose the Company to certain risks. 
 
 On November 13, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which it intends to acquire Luther Burbank Corporation Luther Burbank and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Luther Burbank Savings, in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately 654 million based upon the closing price of the Company s Common Stock on November 11, 2022. As part of the merger agreement, shares of common stock of Luther Burbank will be converted into, and canceled in exchange for, the right to receive 0.3353 shares of the Company s Common Stock, with Luther Burbank shareholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock. On May 4, 2023, the Company's shareholders approved the issuance of shares of Company Common Stock to the shareholders of Luther Burbank in connection with the merger, and the Luther Burbank shareholders approved the proposed merger agreement and merger with the Company and a proposal to approve on a non-binding basis the compensation that certain named executives of Luther Burbank may receive that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger. The Company has submitted an application for approval of the Merger to the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions WDFI ), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve ). On October 13, 2023, the WDFI approved the Merger, subject to approval by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The Company continues to work with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, and the merger remains subject to their approval. If approved, the Merger will result in the Bank s footprint expanding to include the state of California. Because regulatory approval has not yet been achieved, it is possible the transaction may not be consummated as planned or at all, and may expose the Company to certain risks, prior to or after completion, including but not limited to: 
 
 Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger. 
 The Company and Luther Burbank will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions on their respective operations while the merger is pending and the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in the businesses of the Company and Luther Burbank, which could have an adverse effect on their respective business and financial results, and consequently on the combined company if the merger is consummated. 
 Litigation from shareholders of either Luther Burbank or the Company could attempt to prevent or delay the consummation of the merger and result in additional unanticipated costs. 
 Denial or delay of approval as a result of the February 3, 2023 comment letter to the FDIC from the California Reinvestment Coalition co-signed by other community groups and organizations. This letter requested that the FDIC hold public hearings on the bank merger application, and urged the FDIC to deny the bank merger application. 
 Termination of the merger agreement or failure to complete the merger for whatever reason could adversely impact the Company. 
 The value of the merger consideration to be issued by the Company is uncertain because the market price of the Company s Common Stock will fluctuate. 
 The market price of the Company s stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those that currently affect the shares of the Company. 
 Changes in the operations and prospects of the Company or Luther Burbank, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of the Company and Luther Burbank may alter the value of WaFd or Luther Burbank or the market price for shares of Company Common Stock or Luther Burbank common stock by the time the merger is completed. 
 22 

Combining Luther Burbank with the Company may prove more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized. 
 The merger is subject to certain closing conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, will result in the merger not being completed, which may cause the price of the Company s Common Stock to decline. 
 The growth opportunities and cost savings from the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected. 
 Operating costs, customer losses and business disruption following the merger, including adverse effects of relationships with employees, may be greater than expected. 
 The interest rate environment has changed, causing margins to compress and adversely affecting net interest income. 
 The fair value of the Luther Burbank assets to be acquired in the merger are sensitive to the interest rate environment and may fluctuate as a result of changes in interest rates, which could reduce or eliminate the anticipated benefits of the merger for the Company. 
 The combined company may be unable to retain Company and/or Luther Burbank personnel. 
 The Company may incur substantial costs associated with the merger and the integration of Luther Burbank. 
 Issuance of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the merger may adversely affect the market price of Company Common Stock. 
 
 Current uncertain economic conditions pose challenges, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We are operating in an uncertain economic environment. The pandemic caused a global economic slowdown, and while we have seen some economic recovery, continuing supply chain issues, labor shortages and inflation risks continue to affect the economic recovery. U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of additional credit-rating downgrades and economic slowdowns, or a recession in the United States. There remain increased risks of a government shutdown if the spending bills necessary to fund the government through the fiscal year that ends September 30, 2024 are not passed by Congress. Future deterioration in the U.S. credit and financial markets could result in losses or significant deterioration in the fair value of our U.S. government issued, sponsored or guaranteed investments. At September 30, 2023, we had 1.6 billion invested in U.S. government and agency obligations, and further downgrades could affect the stability of securities issued or guaranteed by the federal government and the valuation or liquidity of our portfolio of such investment securities. 
 
 While a government-wide shutdown can reduce GDP growth, the additional economic uncertainty, or a recessionary or stagnant economy, could result in financial stress on the Bank's borrowers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We decreased the expense for credit losses over fiscal year 2021 and 2022 as the economy began to recover, however, deteriorating conditions in the regional economies we serve, or in certain sectors of those economies, in excess of the reasonable and supportable forecasts used to estimate credit losses, could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses. We could also face the following risks in connection with the following events: 
 
 Market developments and economic stagnation or slowdown may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, resulting in increased delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities. 
 The processes we use to estimate the allowance for credit losses and other reserves may prove to be unreliable. Such estimates rely upon complex modeling inputs and judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, which may be rendered inaccurate and/or no longer subject to accurate forecasting. 
 Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite loans become less predictive of future charge-offs. 
 Regulatory scrutiny of the industry could increase, leading to increased regulation of the industry that could lead to a higher cost of compliance, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and increase our exposure to litigation or fines. 
 Ineffective monetary policy or other market conditions could cause rapid changes in interest rates and asset values that would have a materially adverse impact on our profitability and overall financial condition. 
 23 

Further erosion in the fiscal condition of the U.S. Treasury could lead to new taxes that would limit our ability to pursue growth and return profits to shareholders. 
 
 If these conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen, we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition. 
 
 Changes to monetary policy by the Federal Reserve could adversely impact our results of operations. 
 
 The Federal Reserve is responsible for regulating the supply of money in the United States, including open market operations used to stabilize prices in times of economic stress, as well as setting monetary policies. These activities strongly influence our rate of return on certain investments, our hedge effectiveness for mortgage servicing and our mortgage origination pipeline, as well as our costs of funds for lending and investing, all of which may adversely impact our liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and capital position. 
 
 Unstable global economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition, and operations. 
 
 The global credit and financial markets have from time to time experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, high rates of inflation, and uncertainty about economic stability. The financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the evolving conflict in Israel and Gaza. These events have increased and are expected to continue to increase volatility in commodity and energy prices, including oil, and continuing hostilities raise the possibility of supply disruptions. Rising tensions and global instability have the potential to affect consumer confidence in the U.S. and abroad, therefore having a broader effect on financial markets. Sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries in response to such conflict could further adversely impact the financial markets and the global economy, and any economic countermeasures by the affected countries or others could exacerbate market and economic instability. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment, hostile third-party action or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses ("ACL") may not be adequate to cover future loan losses, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Due to the declining economic conditions, our customers may not be able to repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. We maintain an ACL to provide for loan defaults and non-performance, however, losses may exceed the value of the collateral securing the loans and the allowance may not fully cover any excess loss. 
 
 We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. Our ACL is based on these judgments, as well as historical loss experience and an evaluation of the other risks associated with our loan portfolio, including but not limited to, economic trends and conditions, changes in underwriting standards, management, competition, and trends in delinquencies, non-accrual and adversely classified loans, the size and composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and geographic concentrations within the portfolio. Federal regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, review our loans and ACL. If our assumptions and judgments used to determine the ACL prove to be incorrect, if the value of the collateral securing the loans decreases substantially or if regulators disagree with our judgments, we may need to increase the ACL in amounts that exceed our expectations. Material additions to the ACL would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We are exposed to risks related to our operational, technological, and third-party provided technology infrastructure. 
 
 We rely extensively on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of information technology and telecommunications systems to conduct our business. This includes internally developed systems, internally managed systems, outsourced systems provided by third-party service providers, internet facing digital products and services, mobile technologies and the on-going operational maintenance of each service. Any disruptions, failures, or inaccuracies of these systems, including changes and improvements, could result in our inability to service customers, manage operations, manage risk, meet regulatory obligations, or provide timely and accurate financial reporting which could damage our reputation, result in loss of customer business, subject us to regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. 
 
 24 

In many instances, the Company s products and services to customers are dependent upon third-party service providers, who provide necessary, or critical, services and support. Any disruption of such services, or an unplanned termination of a third-party license or service agreement related thereto, could adversely affect our ability to provide necessary products and services for our customers. 
 
 In recent years, we have made a significant ongoing investment to enhance our technological capabilities with the objectives of enhancing customer experience, growing revenue, and improving operating efficiency. There is a risk that these investments may not provide the anticipated benefits and/or will prove significantly more costly and time consuming to produce. If this occurs, we may see a loss of customers, and our financial results and ability to execute on our strategic plan may be adversely impacted. 
 
 We are exposed to risks related to fraud and cyber-attacks. 
 
 Cybersecurity, and the continued development and enhancement of controls, processes, and practices designed to protect customer information, systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a priority for the Company. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance, modify, and refine our protective measures against these evolving threats. 
 
 We are continuously enhancing and expanding our digital products and services to meet customer and business needs with desired outcomes. These digital products and services often include storing, transmitting, and processing confidential customer, employee, financial, and business information. Due to the nature of this information, and the value it has for internal and external threat actors, we, and our third-party service providers, continue to be subject to cyber-attacks and fraud activity that attempts to gain unauthorized access, misuse information and information systems, steal information, disrupt or degrade information systems, spread malicious software, and other illegal activities. 
 
 We believe we have robust preventive, detective, and administrative safeguards and security controls to minimize the probability and magnitude of a material event. However, if we are unable to maintain them, we may fall victim to a material adverse cybersecurity event. Because the tactics and techniques used by threat actors to bypass safeguards and security controls change frequently, and often are not recognized until after an event has occurred, we may be unable to anticipate future tactics and techniques, or to implement adequate and timely protective measures. 
 
 We are subject to additional risk with respect to third-party vendors that process or handle personal and financial data of our customers, partners, suppliers or employees. These third-party vendors may themselves use other vendors to store or process our data, which further elevates our risk exposure. Our third-party vendors have been, and may in the future be, subject to security incidents, including those caused by computer viruses, malware, ransomware, phishing attempts, social engineering, hacking or other means of unauthorized access. Control failures of security measures managed by our third-party service providers could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation and could require us to incur substantial expenses, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 To date, we have no knowledge of a material cyber-attack or other material information security incident affecting the systems we operate and control. However, our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the continuation of a remote or hybrid work environment for our employees and service providers, and our plans to continue to implement and expand digital banking services, expand operations, and use third-party information systems that includes cloud-based infrastructure, platforms, and software. Recent instances of attacks specifically targeting banks and financial services businesses indicate that the risk to our systems remains significant. We, and our third-party providers, are regularly the subject of attempted attacks and the ability of the attackers continues to grow in sophistication. Potential threats to our technologies, systems, networks, and other devices, as well as those of our employees, third party vendors, and other third parties with whom we interact, include Distributed Denial of Service ("DDoS") attacks, computer viruses, hacking, malware, ransomware, credential stuffing, phishing, and other forms of social engineering. Such cyber-attacks and other security incidents are designed to lead to various harmful outcomes, such as unauthorized transactions against our customers accounts, unauthorized or unintended access to confidential information, or the release, gathering, monitoring, disclosure, loss, destruction, corruption, disablement, encryption, misuse, modification or other processing of confidential or sensitive information (including personal information), intellectual property, software, methodologies or business secrets, disruption, sabotage or degradation of service, systems or networks, or other damage. These threats may derive from, among other things, error, fraud or malice on the part of our employees, insiders, or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure. Any of these parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, service providers, customers, partners or other third-party users of our systems or networks to disclose confidential or sensitive information (including personal information) in order to gain access to our systems, networks or data or that of our customers, partners, or third parties with whom we interact, or to unlawfully obtain monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. A cyber-attack or other security incident on the systems we operate and control could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation, result in productivity losses, require us to incur substantial expenses, including response costs associated with 
 25 

investigation and resumption of services, remediation expenses costs associated with customer notification and credit monitoring services, increased insurance premiums, regulatory penalties and fines, and costs associated with civil litigation, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 We also face additional costs when our customers become the victims of cyber-attacks. For example, various retailers have reported that they have been the victims of a cyber-attack in which large amounts of their customers data, including debit and credit card information, is obtained. Our customers may be the victims of phishing scams, providing cyber criminals access to their accounts, or credit or debit card information. In these situations, we incur costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent transaction activity affecting our customers, as well as potential increases to insurance premiums for policies we may maintain to cover these losses. 
 
 Both internal and external fraud and theft are risks. If confidential customer, employee, monetary, or business information were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or if such information were to be intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties, or if our own employees abused their access to financial systems to commit fraud against our customers and the Company. These activities can occur in connection with activities such as the origination of loans and lines of credit, ACH transactions, wire transactions, ATM transactions, and checking transactions, and result in financial losses as well as reputational damage. 
 
 Operational errors can include information system misconfiguration, clerical or record-keeping errors, or disruptions from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors, which may be automated or manual, may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Because of the Company s large transaction volume and its necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process these transactions, there is a risk that technical flaws, tampering, or manipulation of those automated systems, arising from events wholly or partially beyond its control, may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. 
 
 The occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability for us to operate our business, additional costs to correct defects, potential liability to clients, reputational damage, and regulatory intervention, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 A resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar health crisis, may adversely affect our business and our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers in the future. 
 
 The spread of COVID-19 created a global public-health crisis that resulted in significant economic uncertainty, and has impacted household, business, economic, and market conditions, including in the western United States where we conduct nearly all of our business. 
 
 Throughout the pandemic our operations were impacted by the need to close certain offices and limit how customers conduct business through our branch network. Many of our employees continue to work remotely, which exposes us to increased cybersecurity risks such as phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, all of which could expose us to liability and could seriously disrupt our business operations. 
 
 A resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar crisis, could negatively impact our capital, liquidity, and other financial positions and our business, results of operations, and prospects. A resurgence in spread, caused by the rise of new variants, could affect significantly more households and businesses, or cause additional limitations on commercial activity, increased unemployment, increased property vacancy rates and general economic and financial instability. A slow-down or reversal in the economic recovery of the regions in which we conduct our business could result in declines in loan demand and collateral values. Negative impacts on our customers caused by COVID-19 or other pathogens could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans. Future actions of governmental authorities taken in response to a pandemic or similar crisis, such as eviction forbearance, occupancy restrictions, vaccine mandates, or suspension of mortgage foreclosures, could have a negative impact on our business. 
 
 If we are not able to retain or attract key employees, or if we were to suffer the loss of a significant number of employees, we could experience a disruption in our business. 
 
 If a key employee or a substantial number of employees depart or become unable to perform their duties, it may negatively impact our ability to conduct business as usual. Unanticipated departures might require us to divert resources from other areas of our operations, which could create additional stress for other employees, including those in key positions. The 
 26 

loss of qualified and key personnel, or an inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business and consequently impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and losses to us. 
 
 Our risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risks to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate any risk of loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our financial condition, operations or business prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences. 
 
 Climate change could adversely affect our business, affect client activity levels and damage our reputation. 
 
 Concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses are also changing their behavior and business preferences as a result of these concerns. New governmental regulations or guidance relating to climate change, as well as changes in consumers and businesses behaviors and business preferences, may affect whether and on what terms and conditions we will engage in certain activities or offer certain products or services. The governmental and supervisory focus on climate change could also result in our becoming subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements, such as requirements relating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Any such new or heightened requirements could result in increased regulatory, compliance or other costs or higher capital requirements. In connection with the transition to a low carbon economy, legislative or public policy changes and changes in consumer sentiment could negatively impact the businesses and financial condition of our clients, which may decrease revenues from those clients and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients. Our business, reputation and ability to attract and retain employees may also be harmed if our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient. 
 
 Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change will have a negative impact on our customers and their business. Physical risks include extreme storms or wildfires that damage or destroy property and inventory securing loans we make, or may interrupt our customer s business operations, putting them in financial difficulty, and increasing the risk of default. Our customers are also facing changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate change, as well as new regulatory requirements resulting in increased operational costs. 
 
 Regulatory and Litigation Risks 
 
 Failure to comply with the 2020 and 2013 Consent Orders from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding our Home Mortgage Disclosure Act submissions could result in additional regulatory enforcement action. 
 
 In March 2020, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB Office of Enforcement formally notified us of alleged violations of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act HMDA associated with our HMDA reporting submissions. The CFPB alleged that the Bank did not accurately report all required relevant information within the annual HMDA submissions. We responded to the CFPB, noting that the Bank has instituted enhanced procedures to ensure compliance with HMDA, and submitted amended HMDA filings. In October 2020, after further discussions with the CFPB, we entered into a consent order related to our HMDA reporting, under which we agreed to pay a 200,000 civil money penalty and implement a HMDA compliance management system while adhering to a compliance plan. The consent order will be in effect for 10 years. We had previously entered into a consent order with the CFPB in 2013, also relating to HMDA reporting deficiencies, resulting in a 34,000 civil money penalty. The 2013 HMDA Consent Order remains in effect. Any further deficiencies in our HMDA reporting submissions could result in additional regulatory enforcement actions, cause us to incur additional significant compliance costs and subject us to larger fines. Moreover, continued deficiencies in our HMDA reporting could have serious reputational consequences for the Bank. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Non-Compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth-in-Lending Act, Community Reinvestment Act, Fair Lending Laws, Flood Insurance Reform Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, and curtail our expansion opportunities. 
 
 Financial institutions are required under the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act and Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA") to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money-laundering and terrorist activities. Financial institutions are also obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Our failure or our inability to comply with the 
 27 

Patriot Act and BSA statutes and regulations could result in fines or penalties, curtailment of expansion opportunities, enforcement actions, intervention or sanctions by regulators and costly litigation or expensive additional controls and systems. During the last few years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations, and we were subject to a Consent Order and have paid a civil money penalty with respect to our Anti Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism Program, AML/CFT Program (formerly known as our BSA Program), as described below. In addition, the U.S. Government imposed and is expected to continue to expand laws and regulations relating to residential and consumer lending activities that could create significant new compliance burdens and financial costs. 
 
 The Bank was previously subject to a Consent Order from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC for its BSA program that was issued in February 2018 (the BSA Consent Order ). The BSA Consent Order resulted in the Bank incurring significant expenses to implement an effective AML/CFT Program, including payment of a 2,500,000 civil money penalty. The OCC terminated the BSA Consent Order in December 2021. However, the Bank remains subject to the BSA, the Patriot Act, and other laws and regulations requiring financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. Failure to maintain an effective AML/CFT program could have serious business, financial and reputational consequences for the Bank. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We operate in a highly regulated industry, which limits the manner and scope of our business activities. 
 
 We are subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the WDFI, CFPB and the FDIC. In addition, the FRB is responsible for regulating the holding company. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit our shareholders. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations (including laws and regulations governing consumer credit, and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws), but also capital adequacy, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, data reporting and various other factors. As part of this regulatory structure, we are subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Under this structure the WDFI, the FDIC, the CFPB and the Federal Reserve have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations if they determine, among other things, that our operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our operations. In particular, the FDIC has specific authority to take prompt corrective action, if the Bank s capital falls below its current well capitalized level, including limiting the Bank s ability to take brokered deposits, requiring the Bank to raise additional capital and subject it to progressively more severe restrictions on its operations, management and capital distributions, and replacement of senior executive officers and directors. If the Bank ever became critically undercapitalized, it would also be subject to the appointment of a conservator or receiver. 
 
 Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in a range of sanctions and enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil money penalties, formal agreements and cease and desist orders; identified deficiencies in our HMDA reporting and AML/CFT programs have resulted in Consent Orders from the CFPB and OCC, required us to incur significant expenses and compliance costs and subjected us to civil penalties. Failure to meet regulatory requirements could require the Bank to incur additional significant costs in order to bring our programs and operations into compliance, negatively impact our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Recent national and state legislation and regulatory initiatives to support the financial services industry have been coupled with numerous restrictions and requirements that could detrimentally affect our business. 
 
 The Dodd-Frank Act has had a substantial impact on the financial services industry since its passage in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act creates a framework through which regulatory reform has been and continues to be written. While many of the rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented, others are still being drafted. As a result, the impact of the future regulatory requirements continues to be uncertain. We expect the way we conduct business to continue to be affected by these regulatory requirements, including through limitations on our ability to pursue certain lines of business, capital requirements, enhanced reporting obligations, and increased costs. 
 
 The recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank are expected to result in modifications to or additional laws and regulations governing banks and bank holding companies, including increasing capital requirements, modifications to regulatory requirements with respect to liquidity risk management, deposit concentrations, capital adequacy, stress testing and contingency planning, and safe and sound banking practices, or enhanced supervisory or enforcement activities. Other legislative initiatives could detrimentally impact our operations in the future. Regulatory bodies may enact new laws or 
 28 

promulgate new regulations or view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past, or commence investigations or inquiries into our business practices. For example, the Biden Administration announced a government-wide effort to eliminate junk fees which could subject our business practices to even further scrutiny. The CFPB s action on junk fees thus far has largely focused on fees associated with deposit products, such as surprise overdraft fees and non-sufficient funds fees. However, what constitutes a junk fee remains undefined. The CFPB is actively soliciting consumer input on fee practices associated with other consumer financial products or services, signaling that the junk fee initiative is likely to continue to broaden in scope. As a result of this regulatory focus, we have changed how we assess overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees and we may be required to implement additional changes based on regulatory directives or guidance. Such changes have led to and may continue to cause a reduction in our non-interest income thus impacting our overall net income. 
 
 The extent of the impact of any future legislation will be dependent on the specific details of the final legislation passed, if any, but the potential changes outlined above could, among other things, increase our costs, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and the types of financial services and products we may offer, and impact future growth, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Deposit insurance premiums could increase further in the future. 
 
 The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") at a specific level. Historically, unfavorable economic conditions increased bank failures and these additional bank failures decreased the DIF. Extraordinary growth in insured deposits during the first and second quarters of 2020 caused the ratio of the DIF to total insured deposits to fall below the current statutory minimum of 1.35 . In order to restore the DIF to its statutorily mandated minimums, the FDIC significantly increased deposit insurance premium rates, including the Bank's, resulting in increased expenses. The revised assessment rate schedules became effective January 1, 2023, and are applicable to the first quarterly assessment period of 2023 (i.e., January 1 through March 31, 2023, with an invoice payment date of June 30, 2023). The FDIC may further increase the assessment rates or impose additional special assessments in the future to restore and then steadily increase the DIF to these statutory target levels. Any increase in the Bank's FDIC premiums could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. FDIC insurance premiums could increase in the future in response to similar declining economic conditions. 
 
 We are subject to various claims and litigation, which could result in significant expenses, losses and damage to our reputation. 
 
 We are, from time to time, subject to claims and proceedings related to our operations. These claims and legal actions could include supervisory or enforcement actions by our regulators, criminal proceedings by prosecutorial authorities, or civil claims by our customers, former customers, contractual counterparties, and current and former employees. We may also face class action lawsuits for alleged violations of employment, state wage and hour and consumer protection laws. These claims could involve large monetary demands, including civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities, and significant defense costs. If such claims and legal actions are brought, and are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they could result in financial liability and/or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Banking institutions are also increasingly the target of class action lawsuits, including claims alleging deceptive practices or violations of account terms in connection with non-sufficient funds or overdraft charges and violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act FLSA ). In 2022, the Bank paid 495,000 plus claims administrative expenses to settle a class action lawsuit related to allegations of improper assessments of overdraft and insufficient funds fees. In April 2023, we received a letter from an attorney alleging violations of the FLSA and seeking to recover damages for allegedly unpaid wages and overtime for certain of our non-exempt employees. We do not believe these allegations have merit and will oppose any lawsuit if one is filed. If this, or another class action lawsuit is filed or determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement agreement in connection with such a matter, we could be exposed to monetary damages, reputational harm, or subject to limits on our ability to operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, and operating results. 
 
 Our real estate lending also exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities. 
 
 In the course of our business, it is necessary to foreclose and take title to real estate, which could subject us to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. Hazardous substances or waste, contaminants, pollutants or sources thereof may be discovered on properties during our ownership or after a sale to a third party. We could be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic 
 29 

substances or chemical releases at such properties. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial and could substantially exceed the value of the real property. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. We may be unable to recover costs from any third party. These occurrences may materially reduce the value of the affected property, and we may find it difficult or impossible to use or sell the property prior to or following any environmental remediation. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Market and Industry Risks 
 
 Recent negative developments affecting the banking industry, and resulting media coverage, have eroded customer confidence in the banking system. 
 
 The recent high-profile bank failures have generated significant market volatility among publicly traded bank holding companies and, in particular, regional banks like the Company. These market developments have negatively impacted customer confidence in the safety and soundness of regional banks. While the Department of the Treasury, the FRB, and the FDIC have taken steps to ensure that depositors of these recently failed banks would have access to their deposits, including uninsured deposit accounts, there is no guarantee that such actions will be successful in restoring customer confidence in regional banks and the banking system more broadly. If other banks and financial institutions enter receivership or become insolvent in the future due to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, it could cause further disruption to the financial services industry and customers may choose to maintain deposits with larger financial institutions or invest in higher yielding short-term fixed income securities, all of which could materially adversely impact the Company s liquidity, loan funding capacity, net interest margin, capital and results of operations. 
 
 Reflecting concerns about liquidity and the uncertain economic environment, many lenders have reduced funding to borrowers. This tightening of credit has also contributed to a lack of consumer confidence and increased market volatility. 
 
 A worsening of any of the foregoing conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these challenging market conditions on us and others in the banking industry. In particular, we may face increased regulation of our industry, including increased compliance costs and limitations on our ability to pursue business opportunities; significantly higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums; adverse impacts on our stock price and volatility of our Common Stock; and increased competition for deposits due to a lack of consumer confidence in regional banks. If these conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen, we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition. 
 
 A downturn in the real estate market would hurt our business. 
 
 The Bank s business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in real estate lending, in particular commercial real estate loans which are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or certain other types of loans or investments. The market for real estate is cyclical and the outlook for this sector is uncertain. A downturn in the real estate market, accompanied by falling values and increased foreclosures would hurt our business because a large majority of our loans are secured by real estate. 
 
 If a significant decline in market values occurs, the collateral for loans will provide decreasing levels of security. As a result, our ability to recover the principal amount due on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be diminished, and we will be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. Because our loan portfolio contains commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of these loans may cause a significant increase in our nonperforming loans which could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, any of which would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 We own real estate as a result of foreclosures resulting from non-performing loans. If other lenders or borrowers liquidate significant amounts of real estate in a rapid or disorderly fashion, or if the FDIC elects to dispose of significant amounts of real estate from failed financial institutions in a similar fashion, it could have an adverse effect on the values of the properties owned by the Company by depressing the value of these real estate holdings. In such a case, we may incur further write-downs and charge-offs, which could, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Changes in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 30 

We have significant investments in bank premises and equipment for our branch network as well as our retail work force and other branch banking assets. Advances in technology such as e-commerce, telephone, internet and mobile banking, and in-branch self-service technologies including automatic teller machines and other equipment, as well as changing customer preferences for these other methods of accessing our products and services, could decrease the value of our branch network or other retail distribution assets and may cause us to change our retail distribution strategy, close and/or sell certain branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure or reduce our remaining branches and work force. As a result of the current market environment and customer behavior, we have undertaken a branch optimization strategy that has led to the closure, consolidation or sale of certain branches in our network. These actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of other long-lived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate and reconfigure remaining branches or to otherwise further reform our retail distribution channel. In addition, any changes in our branch network strategy could adversely impact our business, financial condition or operations if it results in the loss of customers or deposits which we rely on as a low cost and stable source of funds for our loans and operations. 
 
 We may suffer losses in our loan portfolio due to inadequate or faulty underwriting and loan collection practices. 
 
 There are risks inherent in any loan portfolio, which we attempt to address by adhering to specific underwriting and loan collection practices. Underwriting practices often include analysis of a borrower's prior credit history; financial statements; tax returns; cash flow projections; valuation of collateral; personal guarantees of loans to businesses; and verification of liquid assets. If the underwriting process fails to capture accurate information or proves to be inadequate, we may incur losses on loans that appeared to meet our underwriting criteria, and those losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in the allowance for credit losses. Loan collection resources may be expanded to meet increases in nonperforming loans resulting from economic downturns or to service any loans acquired, resulting in higher loan administration costs. We are also exposed to the risk of improper documentation of foreclosure proceedings that would also increase the cost of collection. 
 
 Our operations are focused in the western United States, subjecting us to the risks of general economic conditions in these market areas. 
 
 Substantially all of the Bank's loans are to individuals, businesses and real estate developers in the Pacific Northwest, Arizona, Utah, Texas, New Mexico and Nevada. As a result, our business depends significantly on general economic conditions in these market areas. A substantial increase in unemployment rates, or severe declines in housing prices and property values in these primary market areas could have a material adverse effect on our business due to a number of factors, including: 
 
 Loan delinquencies may increase. 
 Problem assets and foreclosures may increase. 
 Demand for the Bank's products and services may decline. 
 Collateral for loans made by the Bank, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing a customer's borrowing power and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with the loans. 
 Natural disasters and catastrophic events such as wildfires, floods and earthquakes may damage or destroy collateral for loans made by the Bank and negatively impact the collateral s value and a customer s ability to repay loans. 
 
 Our liquidity may be adversely impacted by issues arising from certain industry deficiencies in foreclosure practices, including delays and challenges in the foreclosure process. 
 
 Foreclosure process issues and the potential legal and regulatory responses to them could negatively impact the process and timing to completion of foreclosures for residential mortgage lenders, including the Bank. During the COVID-19 emergency, certain states in which we do business enacted temporary stays on evictions and foreclosures, or instituted a right to forbearance for homeowners experiencing financial hardship. Even before the adoption of these emergency policies, foreclosure timelines have increased in recent years due to, among other reasons, delays associated with the significant increase in the number of foreclosure cases as a result of economic downturns, additional consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process and voluntary or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure. Should these stays or rights to forbearance be enacted again, or if new legislation is passed regarding residential foreclosures, we may be limited in our ability to take timely possession of real estate assets collateralizing loans, which may increase our loan losses. Increases in the foreclosure timeline may also have an adverse effect on collateral values and the our ability to minimize our losses. 
 
 Impairment of goodwill may adversely impact future results of operations. 
 
 Accounting standards require that we account for acquisitions using a method that could result in goodwill. If the purchase price of the acquired company exceeds the fair value of the acquired net assets, the excess will be included in the Company's Statement of Financial Condition as goodwill. The Company has a significant goodwill balance and, in accordance 
 31 

with GAAP, we evaluate it for impairment at least annually and more often if events or circumstances indicate the possibility of impairment. Evaluations may be based on many factors, some of which are the price of our Common Stock, discounted cash flow projections and data from comparable market acquisitions. A significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in impairment of our goodwill. Future evaluations of goodwill may result in the impairment and write-down of our goodwill balance which could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and adversely affect our operating results. 
 
 Competitive Risks 
 
 The Bank faces strong competition from other financial institutions and new market participants, offering services similar to those offered by the Bank. 
 
 Many competitors, including fintech companies, offer the same types of loan and deposit services that the Company offers. These competitors include national and multinational banks, other regional banks, savings associations, community banks, credit unions and other financial intermediaries. In particular, our competitors include national banks and major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, recent technological breakthroughs have made it possible for other non-traditional competitors to enter the marketplace and compete for traditional banking services. Increased competition within our geographic market area may result in reduced loan originations and deposits. Ultimately, competition from current and future competitors may affect our business materially and adversely. 
 
 We may not be able to continue to grow organically or through acquisitions. 
 
 Historically, we have expanded through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. If market and regulatory conditions change, we may be unable to grow organically or successfully compete for, complete, and integrate potential future acquisitions at the same pace as we have achieved in recent years, or at all. We have historically used our strong stock currency and capital resources to complete acquisitions. Downturns in the stock market and the market price of our stock, changes in our capital position, and changes in our regulatory standing could each have a negative impact on our ability to complete future acquisitions. 
 
 The Company s entry into California may present increased risk that may adversely impact our business, prospects and financial condition. 
 
 The merger will result in WaFd significantly expanding our operations into the state of California where we have limited operating experience. The banking and financial services business in California is highly competitive. Our entry into California will present us with different competitive conditions and we will be required to compete for loans, deposits and customers for financial services with many new competitors in California. Many of these competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader array of financial services than we do. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in California, and the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively. 
 
 Security Ownership Risks 
 
 Our ability to pay dividends is subject to limitations that may affect our ability to continue to pay dividends to shareholders. 
 
 The Company is a separate legal entity from the bank subsidiary and does not have significant operations of its own. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by the Bank's earnings and capital, as well as various federal and state statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the Bank may not be able to pay dividends to the Company. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, then we may not be able to pay dividends on our preferred or Common Stock to our shareholders. If the Bank earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, then our liquidity may be affected and our stock price may be negatively affected by our inability to pay dividends, which will have an adverse impact on both the Company and our shareholders. 
 
 Our 4.875 Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to our Common Stock, and we are prohibited from paying dividends on our Common Stock unless we have paid dividends on our Series A Preferred. 
 
 32 

Shares of our Series A Preferred Stock rank senior to our Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as, and if declared by our Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee of our Board of Directors), out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends under Washington law, non-cumulative cash dividends based on the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock at a rate equal to 4.875 per annum for each quarterly dividend period, beginning on April 15, 2021. If we do not or are unable to pay quarterly dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, we may not pay a dividend to the holders of our Common Stock. Our stock price may be negatively affected by our inability to pay dividends, which will have an adverse impact on both the Company and our shareholders. 
 
 In addition, if we fail to pay, or declare and set apart for payment, dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock for six quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors on our Board of Directors will automatically be increased by two, and the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will have the right to elect two additional members of our Board of Directors (the Preferred Stock Directors to fill such newly created directorships. 
 
 The market price for our Common Stock may be volatile. 
 
 The market price of our Common Stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including those discussed below. The market price of our Common Stock has in the past fluctuated significantly. We expect to see additional volatility in the financial markets due to the uncertainty caused by the continuing global conflicts, commodity shortages and price fluctuations, recent bank failures, uncertainty over the U.S. government debt ceiling, risks of government shutdowns and changing Federal Reserve policy. Some additional factors that may cause the price of our Common Stock to fluctuate include: 
 
 general conditions in the financial markets and real estate markets. 
 macro-economic and political conditions in the U. S. and the financial markets generally. 
 variations in the operating results of the Company and our competitors. 
 events affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to the Company. 
 changes in securities analysts' estimates of our future performance and the future performance of our competitors. 
 announcements by the Company or our competitors of mergers, acquisitions and strategic partnerships, including the pending merger with Luther Burbank. 
 additions or departure of key personnel. 
 the presence or absence of short selling of the Company's Common Stock. 
 future sales by us of our Common Stock or debt securities. 
 
 The stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations. These fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations are expected to continue for the near future, and may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock. 
 
 If the merger with Luther Burbank is approved, the Company s shareholders will have less influence as a shareholder of the combined company than as a shareholder of Company. 
 The Company s shareholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the Board of Directors and on other matters affecting the Company. Based on WaFd s stock price as of November 1, 2023, following completion of the merger, the shareholders of Luther Burbank as a group are expected to hold a maximum ownership interest of approximately 21 of the Company. As a result, after the merger, a current Company's shareholders percentage ownership of the combined company will be smaller than such shareholder s current percentage ownership of the Company s Common Stock. 
 
 There may be future sales or other dilution of the Company's equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or depositary shares. 
 
 Our Board of Directors is authorized to cause the Company to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock junior to our Series A Preferred Stock from time to time without any action on the part of our shareholders, and our Board of Directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over the Common Stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution, winding up and liquidation and other terms. 
 
 The issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to existing shareholders. We may also elect to use Common Stock to fund new acquisitions, which will further dilute existing shareholders. Holders of our Common Stock have no preemptive rights that 
 33 

entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our shareholders. 
 
 We rely, in part, on external financing to fund our operations and the unavailability of such funding in the future could adversely impact our growth and prospects. 
 
 We rely on customer deposits, advances from the FHLB and other borrowings to fund our operations. Management has historically been able to replace maturing deposits, if desired; however, we may not be able to replace such funds at any given point in time if our financial condition or market conditions change or if the cost of doing so might adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 If we need additional funds for our liquidity needs, we may seek additional debt to achieve our long-term business objectives. Such borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us or, if available, may not be on favorable terms. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on reasonable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 
 A person holding our Common Stock could have the voting power of their shares of Common Stock on all matters significantly reduced under Washington's anti-takeover statutes, if the person acquires 10 or more of the voting stock of the Company. 
 
 We are incorporated in the state of Washington and subject to Washington state law. Some provisions of Washington state law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change-in-control events affecting us. For example, Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, with limited exceptions, prohibits a target corporation from engaging in specified significant business transactions for a period of five years after the share acquisition by an acquiring person, without complying with certain shareholder approval requirements. An acquiring person is defined as a person or group of persons that beneficially own 10 or more of our voting securities. Such prohibited transactions include, among other things: 
 
 certain mergers, or consolidations with, disposition of assets to, or issuances of stock to or redemption of stock from, the acquiring person; 
 termination of 5 or more of the employees of the target corporation as a result of the acquiring person's acquisition of 10 or more of the shares; 
 allowing the acquiring person to receive any disproportionate benefit as a shareholder; and 
 liquidating or dissolving the target corporation. 
 
 After the five-year period, certain significant business transactions are permitted, if they comply with certain fair price provisions of the statute or are approved by a majority of the outstanding shares other than those of which the acquiring person has beneficial ownership. As a Washington corporation, the Company is not permitted to opt out of this statute. 
 
 The Company s business or the value of its common shares could be negatively affected as a result of actions by activist shareholders. 
 
 The Company values constructive input from shareholders, and our Board of Directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of the Company s shareholders. Activist shareholders who disagree with the composition of the Board of Directors, the Company s strategic direction, or the way the Company is managed may seek to effect change through various strategies that range from private engagement to public filings, proxy contests, efforts to force transactions not supported by the Board of Directors, and litigation. Responding to some of these actions can be costly and time-consuming, may disrupt the Company s operations and divert the attention of the Board of Directors and management. Such activities could interfere with the Company s ability to execute its strategic plan and to attract and retain qualified executive leadership. The perceived uncertainty as to the Company s future direction resulting from activist strategies could also affect the market price and volatility of the Company s common shares.

 Common Stock 
 
 The Company s Common Stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol WAFD. At September 30, 2023, the number of shareholders of record was 1,045. This figure does not represent the actual number of beneficial owners of Common Stock because shares are frequently held in street name by securities dealers and others for the benefit of individual owners who may vote the shares. 
 
 Additional information about stock options and other equity compensation plans is included in Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 
 
 The Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to bank regulatory requirements, including (but not limited to) the capital adequacy regulations and policies established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Company s Board of Directors' dividend policy is to review our financial performance, capital adequacy, regulatory compliance and cash resources on a quarterly basis, and, if such review is favorable, to declare and pay a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders. 
 
 The Company s 4.875 Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred ), ranks senior to the Company s Common Stock with respect to payment of dividends, and dividends (if declared) accrue and are payable on the Series A Preferred a rate of 4.875 per annum, payable quarterly, in arrears. While the Series A Preferred is outstanding, unless the full dividend for the preceding quarterly period is paid in full, or declared and a sum set aside, no dividend may be declared or paid on the Company s Common Stock. 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 The Company s stock repurchase program was publicly announced by the board of directors on February 3, 1995 and has no expiration date. Under this program, a total of 76,956,264 shares of the Company s Common Stock have been authorized for repurchase. The following table shows the share repurchases made for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plan Maximum Number of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plan at the End of the Period July 1, 2023 to July 31, 2023 211 30.25 211 2,559,400 August 1, 2023 to August 31, 2023 217 30.55 217 2,559,183 September 1, 2023 to September 30, 2023 2,559,183 Total 428 30.41 428 2,559,183

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts within the consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical for understanding our historical and future performance. Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of the matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. Management s determination of the amount of the ACL is a critical accounting estimate as it requires significant reliance on the credit risk we ascribe to individual borrowers, the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on individually evaluated loans, significant reliance on historical loss rates on homogeneous portfolios, consideration of our quantitative and qualitative evaluation of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. 
 
 Going forward, the methodology used to calculate the ACL will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Material changes to these and other relevant factors may result in greater volatility to the allowance for credit losses, and therefore, greater volatility in our reported earnings. 
 
 Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We have determined our goodwill balance is all related to a single reporting unit and perform an annual impairment assessment on August 31st, or sooner if an impairment indicator exists. We perform a quantitative impairment assessment and, upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 
 
 When performing the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using the market capitalization approach, based on quoted market prices of our securities, adjusted for the effect of a control premium. Based on the results of the annual quantitative evaluation for 2023, the fair value of our single reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value and did not result in impairment for the reporting unit. 
 
 The Company continuously monitors for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in determining fair value. While the Company believes the judgments and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test are reasonable, different assumptions or changes in general industry, market and macro-economic conditions could change the estimated fair values and, therefore, future impairment charges could be required, which could be material to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Select information regarding the ACL is under the "Allowance for Credit Losses" heading within this section below. For further details on the ACL or goodwill, see Notes A and E to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 
 UPDATE ON LUTHER BURBANK MERGER 
 On November 13, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement and plan of reorganization with Luther Burbank Corporation Luther Burbank ), pursuant to which Luther Burbank will be merged with and into WaFd with WaFd as the surviving institution, promptly followed by the merger of Luther Burbank s wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Luther Burbank Savings, LBS with and into WaFd Bank (the Merger ). The proposed Merger is an all-stock transaction valued at approximately 654 million based upon the closing price of the Company s Common Stock on November 11, 2022. As part of the merger agreement, Luther Burbank shares of Common Stock will be converted into, and canceled in exchange for, the right to receive 0.3353 shares of the Company s Common Stock, with Luther Burbank shareholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock. The Company has submitted an application for approval of the Merger to the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions WDFI ), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve ). Shareholders of both companies approved the Merger at special meetings of their respective shareholders on May 4, 2023. On October 13, 2023, the WDFI approved the Merger subject to approval by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The Company continues to work with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to receive their approval. Luther Burbank is headquartered in Santa Rosa, CA and operates 10 full service branches in 
 39 

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 California, 1 full service branch in Washington, 6 loan production offices in California and one loan production office in Oregon. If approved, the Merger will result in the Bank s footprint expanding to include the state of California. 
 
 RECENT INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS 
 During the first calendar quarter of 2023, the banking industry experienced significant volatility with multiple high-profile bank failures, primarily due to liquidity concerns. This resulted in industry-wide uncertainty and concerns related to liquidity, deposit outflows, unrealized securities losses and eroding consumer confidence in the banking system. The Company took a number of preemptive actions which included proactive outreach to clients and actions to maximize funding sources in response to these recent developments. These actions included increasing the target cash balance range, enhancing deposit flow and concentration monitoring, and utilizing the Federal Reserve's Bank Term Funding Program as an additional source of liquidity. 
 Despite these negative industry developments, the Company's liquidity position and balance sheet remain strong and the Company did not experience negative impacts to its financial condition outside of those observed generally across the industry, such as increasing funding costs. The Company experienced net deposit inflows for the year ending September 30, 2023 with total deposits increasing slightly by 0.25 . Our deposit base is highly diversified with little industry or customer concentration and 74 of total deposits are FDIC insured or collateralized as of September 30, 2023. Furthermore, the Company remains well capitalized. The Company's capital at September 30, 2023 remains at high levels with common equity tier 1 capital ("CET1") and total risk-based capital ratios of 10.37 and 13.31 , respectively, for the Company and 11.63 and 12.81 for the Bank, respectively, which exceed the regulatory minimum well-capitalized guidelines of 6.50 and 10.00 . 
 The FDIC has approved a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to the DIF following the recent bank closures. The special assessment will be 13.4 basis points applied to estimated uninsured deposits greater than 5 billion, collected over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2024. The assessment is subject to true ups based on the changes to the estimated loss from the receiverships and corrective amendments to the amount of uninsured deposits reported for December 31, 2022. Management does not expect the resulting expense to be material to its financial results given the Company's low level of uninsured deposits.

 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
 The following table provides detail regarding the Company's allowance for credit losses (periods prior to 2020 applied the incurred loss model as the current expected credit loss methodology ("CECL") was implemented in 2020).

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following table shows changes in the Company's allowance for credit losses since the prior year. 
 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Change Change (In thousands) Allowance for credit losses: Commercial loans Multi-family 13,155 12,013 1,142 10 Commercial real estate 28,842 25,814 3,028 12 Commercial industrial 58,773 57,210 1,563 3 Construction 29,408 26,161 3,247 12 Land - acquisition development 7,016 12,278 (5,262) (43) Total commercial loans 137,194 133,476 3,718 3 Consumer loans Single-family residential 28,029 25,518 2,511 10 Construction - custom 2,781 3,410 (629) (18) Land - consumer lot loans 3,512 5,047 (1,535) (30) HELOC 2,859 2,482 377 15 Consumer 2,832 2,875 (43) (1) Total consumer loans 40,013 39,332 681 2 Total allowance for loan losses 177,207 172,808 4,399 3 Reserve for unfunded commitments 24,500 32,500 (8,000) (25) Total allowance for credit losses 201,707 205,308 (3,601) (2) 
 
 The allowance for loan losses increased by 4,399,000, or 2.55 , from 172,808,000 as of September 30, 2022, to 177,207,000 at September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the allowance of 177,207,000 is for loans that are evaluated on a pooled basis, which was comprised of 107,049,000 related to the quantitative component and 70,158,000 related to management's qualitative overlays. 
 The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 41,500,000 in 2023, compared to a provision of 3,000,000 for 2022. These amounts are net of provision and recapture related to the unfunded commitments reserve. In 2023, provisioning was largely due to adjustments resulting from one large charge-off taken, offset by reduced unfunded commitment balances. For the year ended September 30, 2023, net charge-offs were 45,101,000, compared to recoveries of 3,508,000 in the prior year. The ratio of the total ACL to total gross loans decreased to 1.03 as of September 30, 2023, as compared to 1.06 as of September 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily related to a shift in mix of loan types within the portfolio. Loan portfolios with lower historical losses, like multi-family and single family residential saw increased balances while those with higher historical losses, like construction, saw decreases. 
 The reserve for unfunded loan commitments was 24,500,000 as of September 30, 2023, compared to 32,500,000 as of September 30, 2022. 
 Management believes the total ACL is sufficient to absorb estimated losses inherent in the portfolio of loans and unfunded commitments.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

ASSET QUALITY 
 Troubled debt restructured loans ("TDRs"). TDRs are reserved for under the Company's CECL methodology. Most TDRs are performing and accruing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Company about modifications due to temporary financial difficulties. Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success. The concession for these loans is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of 100 to 200 basis points for a specific term, usually six to twelve months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period. 
 Concessions for construction, land A D and multi-family loans are typically an extension of maturity combined with a rate reduction of normally 100 basis points. Before granting approval to modify a loan in a TDR, a borrower s ability to repay is considered by evaluating current income levels, debt-to-income ratio, credit score, loan payment history and an updated evaluation of the secondary repayment source. 
 
 If a loan is on non-accrual status before becoming a TDR, it will stay on non-accrual status following restructuring until it has been performing for at least six months, at which point it may be moved to accrual status. If a loan is on accrual status before it becomes a TDR, and it is concluded that a full repayment is highly probable, it will remain on accrual status following restructuring. If the homogeneous restructured loan does not perform, it is placed in non-accrual status when it is 90 days delinquent. For commercial loans, six consecutive payments on newly restructured loan terms are required prior to returning the loan to accrual status. After the required six consecutive payments are made, a management assessment may conclude that collection of the entire principal and interest due is still in doubt. In those instances, the loan will remain non-accrual. A loan that defaults and is subsequently modified would impact the Company's delinquency trend, which is part of the qualitative risk factors component of the CECL methodology. Any modified loan that re-defaults and is charged-off would impact the quantitative component of the CECL methodology. 
 
 Non-Performing Assets. When a borrower violates a condition of a loan, the Bank attempts to cure the default by contacting the borrower. In most cases, defaults are cured promptly. If the default is not cured within an appropriate time frame, typically 90 days, the Bank may institute appropriate action to collect the loan, such as making demand for payment or initiating foreclosure proceedings on the collateral. If foreclosure occurs, the collateral will typically be sold at public auction and may be purchased by the Bank. 
 Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the judgment of management, the probability of collecting interest or principal is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. The Bank does not accrue interest on loans 90 days past due or more. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof for additional information. 
 The Bank will consider modifying the interest rate and terms of a loan if it determines that a modification is deemed to be the best option available for collection in full or to minimize the loss to the Bank. Most loans restructured in TDRs are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Bank about a modification due to temporary financial difficulties. Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success. The modification of these loans is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of between 100 to 200 bps for a specific term, usually six to twelve months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period. Principal forgiveness generally is not an available option for restructured loans. As of September 30, 2023, single-family residential loans comprised 84.7 of restructured loans. The Bank reserves for restructured loans within its pool based general reserve methodology, except in instances where management considers it appropriate to evaluate individually. 
 Real estate acquired by foreclosure or deed-in-lieu thereof REO or Real Estate Owned is classified as real estate held for sale. When property is acquired, it is recorded at the fair market value less estimated selling costs at the date of acquisition. Interest accrual ceases on the date of acquisition and all costs incurred in maintaining the property from that date forward are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred for the improvement or development of such property are capitalized. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof for additional information.

 ___________________ 
 (1) For the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized 2,824,000 in interest income on cash payments received from borrowers on non-accrual loans. The Company would have recognized interest income of 1,981,000 for the same period had these loans performed according to their original contract terms. The recognized interest income may include more than twelve months of interest for some of the non-accrual loans that were brought current or paid off. In addition to the non-accrual loans reflected in the above table, the Company had 263,075,000 of loans that were less than 90 days delinquent at September 30, 2023 but were classified as substandard for one or more reasons. If these loans were deemed non-performing, the Company's ratio of total non-performing assets and performing restructured loans as a percent of total assets would have increased to 1.63 at September 30, 2023. For a discussion of the Company's policy for placing loans on non-accrual status, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Non-performing assets increased 30.0 to 57,924,000, or 0.26 of total assets, at September 30, 2023, compared to 44,554,000, or 0.21 of total assets, at September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily a result of an increase of 15,888,000 in non-accrual loans partially offset by a 2,518,000 decline in real estate owned. Other property owned of 3,353,000 as of September 30, 2023 is comprised entirely of a government guarantee related to equipment obtained via a commercial loan foreclosure.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 TDRs declined to 46,117,000 as of September 30, 2023, from 56,817,000 as of September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, 45,167,000 or 97.9 of TDRs were performing. Non-performing TDRs of 950,000 are included in NPAs. Total NPAs and performing TDRs as a percent of total assets have declined to 0.46 as of September 30, 2023, from 0.48 as of September 30, 2022. During 2023, there were no TDR additions and reductions of 10,700,223 due to prepayments and normal payment activity. As of September 30, 2023, 84.7 of TDRs are comprised of single-family residential loans. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, real estate owned totaled 4,149,000, a decrease of 2,518,000, or 37.8 , from 6,667,000 as of September 30, 2022, primarily due to sales of REO properties offset by new REO additions. During 2023, the Company sold real estate owned properties for total net proceeds of 7,192,000. The majority of REO properties are former bank premises that are expected to be sold. 
 The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-accrual loans decreased to 351 as of September 30, 2023, from 500 as of September 30, 2022.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Cash and cash equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents increased to 980,649,000 at September 30, 2023, as compared to 683,965,000 at September 30, 2022. The change was meant to increase balance sheet liquidity and was used to fund growth in the loan portfolio. The increase in cash was the result of the 40,759,000 increase in customer accounts and 1,525,000,000 increase in borrowings. 
 Available-for-sale investment securities : Available-for-sale securities decreased 55,940,000, or 2.7 , during the year ended September 30, 2023, to 1,995,097,000, primarily due to principal repayments of 420,154,000, which exceeded purchases of 376,481,000, a 9,360,000 decline in the value of available-for-sale securities, and sales of 1,169,000. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had a net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities of 123,519,000, which is recorded net of tax within AOCI, compared to an unrealized loss of 111,700,000 as of September 30, 2022. 
 Substantially all of the Company s available-for-sale debt securities are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. The remaining securities are issued by highly-rated municipalities or corporate borrowers. The Company does not believe that any of its available-for-sale debt securities have credit loss impairment as of September 30, 2023, therefore, no allowance was recorded. The impact going forward will depend on the composition, characteristics, and credit quality of the securities portfolios as well as the economic conditions at future reporting periods. 
 Held-to-maturity investment securities : Held-to-maturity securities decreased by 39,713,000 to 423,586,000, or 8.6 , during the year ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to principal repayments and maturities of 39,414,000. There were no held-to-maturity securities sold during the year ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the net unrealized loss on held-to-maturity securities was 68,398,000, compared to 56,439,000 the year prior, which management attributes to the change in interest rates since acquisition. 
 All of the Company s held-to-maturity debt securities are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss, thus the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for held-to-maturity securities as of September 30, 2023. The impact going forward will depend on the composition, characteristics, and credit quality of the securities portfolios as well as the economic conditions at future reporting periods. 
 The table below shows the available-for-sale and held-for-investment securities portfolios categorized by maturity band.

 For further information on our investment portfolio, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 
 Loans receivable: Loans receivable, net of related contra accounts, increased 1,362,986,000, or 8.5 , to 17,476,550,000 at September 30, 2023, from 16,113,564,000 one year earlier. The increase resulted primarily from originations of 4,702,156,000, a decrease to loans-in-process of 1,110,083,000 and loan purchases of 80,015,000, partially offset by loan repayments of 4,435,269,000 during the year ended September 30, 2023. Commercial loan originations accounted for 73.9 of total originations and consumer originations were 26.1 as the Company continues to focus on commercial lending, coupled with growing economies in all major markets in which we operate. 
 The following table presents loan balances by category and the year-over-year change.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 The contractual loan payment period for residential mortgage loans originated by the Company normally ranges from 15 to 30 years. Experience during recent years has indicated that, because of prepayments in connection with refinancing and sales of property, residential loans typically have a weighted average life of approximately five years.

 Historically, a significant number of time deposit account holders roll over their balances into new time deposits of the same term at the Bank s then current rate. To ensure a continuity of this trend, the Bank expects to continue to offer market rates of interest. The ability to retain maturing time deposits is difficult to project; however, the Bank believes that by competitively pricing these certificates, levels deemed appropriate by management can be achieved on a continuing basis.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 At September 30, 2023, the Bank had 1,779,272,000 of time deposits in amounts of 250,000 or more outstanding, maturing as follows: 763,615,000 within 3 months; 419,791,000 over 3 months through 6 months; 281,404,000 over 6 months through 12 months; and 314,462,000 thereafter. 
 Time deposits with a maturity of one year or less have penalties for premature withdrawal equal to 90 days of interest. When the maturity is greater than one year but less than four years, the penalty is 180 days of interest. When the maturity is greater than four years, the penalty is 365 days of interest. Early withdrawal penalty fee income for the years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021 amounted to 1,618,000, 267,000 and 198,000, respectively. 
 For additional details on customer accounts, including uninsured deposits, see Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 
 
 Borrowings : Total borrowings increased to 3,650,000,000 as of September 30, 2023, as compared to 2,125,000,000 at September 30, 2022. Growth in loans receivable was largely funded by new borrowings from both the FHLB and FRB. The weighted average rate for borrowings was 3.98 as of September 30, 2023, versus 2.02 at September 30, 2022, the increase being primarily due to higher rates on new short-term borrowings. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk and convert certain FHLB advances to fixed rate payments. Taking into account these hedges, the weighted average effective maturity of FHLB advances at September 30, 2023 is 2.01 years. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 COMPARISON OF 2023 RESULTS WITH 2022 
 Net Income : Net income increased 21,096,000, or 8.9 , to 257,426,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 236,330,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The change was due to the factors described below. 
 Net Interest Income : For the year ended September 30, 2023, net interest income was 690,234,000, an increase of 95,645,000 or 16.1 from the year ended September 30, 2022. Net interest margin was 3.40 for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 3.16 in the prior year. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to rising interest rates. The average rate earned on interest-earning assets grew by 159 basis points to 5.13 while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 168 basis points to 2.18 . 
 The change in net interest income was also impacted by the 1,514,820,000, or 8.1 , increase in interest earning assets while average interest-bearing liabilities increased by 1,698,461,000 or 11.7 . During 2023, the average balance of loans receivable increased 2,011,903,000 or 13.3 , while the combined average balances of mortgage backed securities, other investment securities and cash decreased by 536,288,000 or 14.7 . Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased by 279,150,000 over the same period. 
 Rate/Volume Analysis 
 
 The table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense of the Company for the years indicated. For each category of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability, information is provided on changes attributable to: (1) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (2) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by old average volume). The change in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in both volume and rate has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.

 Provision (Release) for Credit Losses : The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 41,500,000 in 2023, compared to a provision of 3,000,000 for 2022. In 2023, provisioning was largely due to adjustments made as a result of one large charge-off taken, offset by reduced unfunded commitment balances. For the year ended September 30, 2023, net charge-offs were 45,101,000, compared to recoveries of 3,508,000 in the prior year. 
 
 Other Income : Other income was 52,201,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 14,171,000, or 21.4 , from 66,372,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease is primarily due to unrealized gains recorded in the prior year for certain equity investments that resulted in small losses in the current year. This change made up 13,992,730 of the overall decrease. 
 
 Other Expense : Operating expense was 376,035,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 17,460,000, or 4.9 , from the 358,575,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Compensation and benefits costs increased 2,617,000 or 1.3 year-over-year primarily due to annual merit increases and investments in strategic initiatives combined with reduced cost capitalization as loan originations have decreased. FDIC Premiums increased 10,494,000 in 2023 compared to the prior year as a result of increase FDIC assessment rates. Information technology costs increased by 2,245,000 in 2023 as compared to 2022 as we continue to execute becoming a digital first bank. Also, the Company realized expenses of 2,991,000 in 2023 related to our pending merger with Luther Burbank Corporation. 
 
 The Company s efficiency ratio was 50.7 for 2023 as compared to 54.3 for the prior year. The number of staff, including part-time employees on a full-time equivalent basis, was 2,120 and 2,132 at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Total operating expense for the years ended September 30, 2023, and 2022 were 1.74 and 1.78 , respectively, of average assets. 
 
 Gain on Real Estate Owned : Net gain on real estate owned was 176,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to a net gain of 651,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. This amount includes ongoing maintenance expense, periodic valuation adjustments, and gains on sales of REO.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 Income Tax Expense : Income tax expense was 67,650,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3,943,000, or 6.2 , from the 63,707,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase is mostly due to an 8.3 increase in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate for 2023 was 20.81 as compared to 21.23 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The effective tax rate of 20.81 for 2023 differs from the statutory rate of 21 mainly due to the effects of state taxes, tax exempt income, tax credit investments and certain differences in book and tax deductions. 

COMPARISON OF 2022 RESULTS WITH 2021 
 
 For management's review of the factors that affected our results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 18, 2022. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 The principal sources of funds for the Company's activities are loan repayments (including prepayments), net deposit inflows, borrowings, repayments and sales of investments and retained earnings, if applicable. The Company's principal sources of revenue are interest on loans and interest and dividends on investments. Additionally, the Company earns fee income for loan, deposit, insurance and other services. 
 On February 8, 2021, in connection with an underwritten public offering, the Company issued 300,000 shares of 4.875 Noncumulative Perpetual Series A Preferred Stock Series A Preferred Stock ). Net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses, were 293,325,000. The public offering consisted of the issuance and sale of 12,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of the Series A Preferred Stock, at a public offering price of 25.00 per depositary share. Holders of the depositary shares are entitled to all proportional rights and preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). The depositary shares are traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol "WAFDP." The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the Company, subject to all applicable regulatory approvals, on or after April 15, 2026. 
 The Company's shareholders' equity at September 30, 2023, was 2,426,426,000, or 10.80 of total assets, as compared to 2,274,260,000, or 10.95 of total assets, at September 30, 2022. The Company's shareholders' equity was impacted in the year by net income of 257,426,000, the payment of 63,792,000 in Common Stock dividends, payment of 14,625,000 in preferred stock dividends, 30,463,000 of treasury stock purchases, as well as other comprehensive loss of 5,560,000. The Company paid out 26.6 of its 2023 earnings in cash dividends to common shareholders, compared with 28.0 last year. For the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company returned 36.6 of net income to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases as compared to 27 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Management believes the Company's strong net worth position allows it to manage balance sheet risk and provide the capital support needed for controlled growth in a regulated environment. The Company s share repurchase program may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time, and the timing and amount of share repurchases is subject to market conditions and the market price of the Company s Common Stock, as well as other factors. 
 The Bank has a credit line with the FHLB of up to 45 of total assets depending on specific collateral eligibility. This line provides a substantial source of additional liquidity if needed. Based on collateral pledged as of September 30, 2023, the Bank had 2,357,588,000 of additional borrowing capacity at the FHLB. 
 
 The Bank has entered into borrowing agreements with the FHLB to borrow funds under a short-term floating rate cash management advance program and fixed-rate term advance agreements. All borrowings are secured by stock of the FHLB, deposits with the FHLB, and a blanket pledge of qualifying loans receivable as provided in the agreements with the FHLB. 
 
 54 

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 The Bank has elected to utilize the Federal Reserve's Bank Term Funding program to leverage its highly favorable terms to fortify the Bank's liquidity position. These borrowings are repayable at any time without penalty and are the lowest cost funding source available. Based on collateral pledged as of September 30, 2023, the Bank had 1,119,000,000 of additional borrowing capacity within the BTFP. The Bank is also eligible to borrow under the Federal Reserve Bank's primary credit program. 
 The Company's cash and cash equivalents were 980,649,000 at September 30, 2023, which is a 43.4 increase from the balance of 683,965,000 as of September 30, 2022. The change was meant to increase balance sheet liquidity and was used to fund growth in the loan portfolio. The increase in cash was the result of a 40,759,000 increase in customer accounts and 1,525,000,000 increase in borrowings. The net loans balance increased by 1,362,986,000 during the year ended September 30, 2023. See Changes in Financial Condition above and the Statement of Cash Flows included in the financial statements for additional details regarding this change.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

INTEREST RATE RISK 
 
 The primary source of income for the Company is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred for interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the difference between the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Both the pricing and mix of the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities influence these factors. All else being equal, if the interest rates on the Company's interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on its interest-earning assets, the result would be a reduction in net interest income and with it, a reduction in net earnings. 
 
 Interest rate risk arises in part due to the Bank's significant holdings of fixed-rate single-family home loans, which are longer-term than customer accounts that constitute its primary liabilities. Accordingly, assets do not usually respond as quickly to changes in interest rates as liabilities. In the absence of management action, net interest income can be expected to decline when interest rates rise and to expand when interest rates fall. Shortening the maturity or repricing of the investment portfolio is one action that management can take. The composition of the investment portfolio was 45.9 variable rate and 54.1 fixed rate as of September 30, 2023 to provide some protection against rising rates. In addition, the Bank is producing more commercial loans that have shorter terms and/or variable rates. There has also been focus on increasing less rate sensitive transaction deposit accounts. These accounts make up 67.0 of the deposit portfolio as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 The Company's balance sheet strategy, in conjunction with low operating costs, has allowed the Company to manage interest rate risk, within guidelines established by the Board, through all interest rate cycles. It is management's objective to grow the dollar amount of net interest income, through the rate cycles, acknowledging that there will be some periods of time when that will not be feasible. Cash and cash equivalents of 980,649,000 and shareholders' equity of 2,426,426,000 provide management with flexibility in managing interest rate risk. Based on management's assessment of the current interest rate environment, the Company has taken steps, including growing commercial loans having shorter average lives and transaction deposit accounts, to position itself for changing interest rates. 
 
 Net Interest Income Sensitivity. We estimate the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates using an interest rate simulation model that includes assumptions related to the level of balance sheet growth, deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments for multiple interest rate change scenarios. Interest rate sensitivity depends on certain repricing characteristics in our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, including the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during the periods of changes in market interest rates. The analysis presented below assumes a constant balance sheet. Actual results would differ from the assumptions used in this model, as management monitors and adjusts loan and deposit pricing and the size and composition of the balance sheet to respond to changing interest rates. 
 In the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in both short- and long-term interest rates, the model estimates that net interest income would decrease by 2.0 in the next year. This compares to an estimated increase of 1.9 as of the September 30, 2022 analysis. It is noted that a flattening yield curve where the spread between short-term rates and long-term rates decreases would likely result in lower net interest income and vice versa for a steepening yield curve. Management estimates that a gradual increase of 300 basis points in short-term rates and 100 basis points in long-term rates over two years would result in a 0.2 increase in net interest income in the first year and a decrease of 1.0 in the second year, assuming a constant balance sheet and no management intervention. Alternatively, in the event of an immediate and parallel decrease of 100 basis points in both short and long-term interest rates, the model estimates that net interest income would increase by 4.94 . 
 
 Net Portfolio Value ("NPV") Sensitivity. The NPV is an estimate of the market value of shareholders' equity at a point in time. It is derived by calculating the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and the present value of expected cash flows from liabilities and off-balance-sheet contracts. The sensitivity of the NPV to changes in interest rates provides a longer term view of interest rate risk of the current balance sheet as it incorporates all future expected cash flows. As of September 30, 2023, in the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in interest rates, the NPV is estimated to decrease by 723,000,000, or 27.4 , and the NPV-to-total assets ratio to decline to 9.5 from a base of 12.4 . As of September 30, 2022, in the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in interest rates, the NPV was estimated to decrease by 617,000,000, or 20.9 , and the NPV-to-total assets ratio to decline to 12.6 from a base of 14.9 . The change in the sensitivity of the NPV ratio to this assumed change in interest rates is primarily due to the 
 56 

flattening of the yield curve and changes in balance sheet mix year over year. Prepayment speeds for single family mortgages are low at September 30, 2023 with the Bank's conditional payment rate ("CPR") for this portfolio segment at 7.0 , down from 8.1 the year before. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, in the event of an immediate and parallel decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates, the NPV is estimated to increase NPV by 327,000,000, or 12.38 , and increase the NPV to total assets ratio to 13.59 from a base of 12.4 . 
 
 Interest Rates. The Company measures the difference between the rate on interest-earning assets and the rate on interest-bearing liabilities at the end of each period. The period end interest rate spread was 2.61 at September 30, 2023 and 3.36 at September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, the weighted-average rate on interest-earning assets increased by 103 basis points to 5.07 compared to September 30, 2022. The higher rate on interest-earning assets is due primarily to the Federal Reserve Bank's rate increases which have led to higher rates on adjustable rate loans, investment securities and cash as well as asset mix shifting to loans receivable. As of September 30, 2023, the weighted-average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 178 basis points to 2.46 compared to September 30, 2022. The higher rate on interest-bearing liabilities primarily resulted from customer deposits repricing and higher rates on new borrowings. The period end interest rate spread for the last eight fiscal quarters is shown below: 
 SEP 2023 JUN 2023 MAR 2023 DEC 2022 SEP 2022 JUN 2022 MAR 2022 DEC 2021 Interest rate on loans and mortgage-backed securities 5.08 4.97 4.81 4.59 4.13 3.67 3.37 3.30 Interest rate on other interest-earning assets 4.98 4.74 4.45 3.19 3.16 2.02 0.85 0.67 Combined, all interest-earning assets 5.07 4.94 4.77 4.46 4.04 3.50 2.93 2.83 Interest rate on customer accounts 2.12 1.82 1.48 0.94 0.51 0.32 0.24 0.23 Interest rate on borrowings (1) 3.98 3.93 3.69 3.14 2.02 1.43 1.55 1.49 Combined cost of funds 2.46 2.22 1.91 1.29 0.68 0.43 0.36 0.35 Interest rate spread 2.61 2.72 2.86 3.17 3.36 3.07 2.57 2.48 (1) Represents the effective rate taking into consideration cash flow hedges on FHLB borrowings. 
 
 57 

The chart below shows the volatility of our period end net interest spread (dashed line measured against the right axis) compared to the relatively consistent growth in net interest income (solid line measured against the left axis). The relative consistency of net interest income is accomplished by actively managing the size and composition of the balance sheet through different rate cycles. 

Net Interest Margin. The net interest margin is measured using net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets for the period. The net interest margin increased to 3.40 for the year ended September 30, 2023, from 3.16 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 159 basis points to 5.13 and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 168 basis points to 2.18 . The higher yield on interest-earning assets was primarily due to the impact of rising rates on adjustable rate assets and cash. The higher rate in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to replacing maturing borrowings at higher rates. 
 
 For the year ended September 30, 2023, average interest-earning assets increased by 8.1 to 20,327,301,000, up from 18,812,481,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Balance sheet growth in 2023 was primarily due to the growth in loans receivable. During 2023, average loans receivable increased 2,011,903,000, or 13.3 , while the combined average balances of mortgage-backed securities, other investment securities and cash decreased by 536,288,000 or 14.7 . Management views organic loan growth as the highest and best use of capital, thus the focus on primarily growing loans receivable. 
 
 During 2023, average interest-bearing customer deposit accounts increased 167,664,000 or 1.3 and the average balance of borrowings increased by 1,530,807,000, or 88.4 , from 2022.

The following table shows the potential impact of changing interest rates on net income for one year. The Company's focus is primarily on the impact of abrupt upward or downward changes in short term rates. It is important to note that this is not a forecast or prediction of future events, but is used as a tool for measuring potential risk. This analysis assumes zero balance sheet growth and a constant percentage composition of assets and liabilities. 
 Potential Increase (Decrease) in Net Interest Income Basis Point Increase (Decrease) in Interest Rates September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 (In thousands, except percentages) (200) 57,103 7.79 (18,501) (2.40) (100) 36,168 4.94 (10,525) (1.37) 100 (9,507) (1.30) 4,788 0.62 200 (14,907) (2.03) 14,381 1.87 300 (22,737) (3.10) 21,110 2.74 
 
 Actual results will differ from the assumptions used in this model, as management monitors and adjusts both the size and the composition of the balance sheet in order to respond to changing interest rates. In a rising interest rate environment, it is likely that the Company will grow its balance sheet to offset margin compression that may occur. Improvement in the net interest income sensitivity during the year is primarily the result of interest rate swap activity and extension of the maturity of certain borrowings. 
 
 Another method used to quantify interest rate risk is the NPV analysis. This analysis calculates the difference between the present value of interest-bearing liabilities and the present value of expected cash flows from interest-earning assets and off-balance-sheet contracts. The following tables set forth an analysis of the Company s interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in NPV resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve (measured in 100-basis-point increments). 
 
 The tables below express the NPV under varying interest scenarios.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of WaFd, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of WaFd, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023, and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Allowance for Loan Losses - Refer to Notes A and E to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The estimates of the Company's expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is based on relevant information about current conditions, past events, and reasonable and supportable forecasts regarding collectability of the reported amounts. In order to estimate the allowance for loan losses ("ALL"), the Company used either a cohort or weighted average remaining maturities methodology to determine the historical loss rate, by loan portfolio class, then considered whether qualitative adjustments to those historical loss rates were warranted. 
 
 Significant management judgments are required in determining whether, and to what extent, qualitative adjustments for each portfolio loan class are required. These adjustments are made after considering the conditions over the period from which historical loss experience was based and are split into two components: 1) asset or class specific risk characteristics or current 
 62 

conditions at the reporting date related to portfolio credit quality, remaining payments, volume and nature, credit culture and management, business environment or other management factors, not captured in the historical loss rates and 2) reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and collateral values. 
 
 Given the significance of the ALL, and management judgment required for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, performing audit procedures to evaluate the ALL requires a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort. 
 
 We have identified the ALL estimate for certain loan portfolio classes as a critical audit matter based upon the above factors. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the ALL estimate for loan portfolio classes for which we concluded the ALL was significant included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over model applicability, qualitative adjustments, the reasonable and supportable forecast adjustments, and management's review and approval process over the final determination of the ALL. 
 
 We tested the underlying data and mathematical accuracy of the cohort methodology used to determine most loan portfolio class historical loss rates. We also evaluated the reasonableness and conceptual soundness of the methodology. 
 
 To test the qualitative adjustments, we performed analysis to evaluate management s determination of the qualitative adjustments made to account for specific risk characteristics or current conditions that differ from the period over which the historical loss rate was determined. Our procedures included evaluating management s inputs and assumptions used in determining the qualitative and forecast adjustments by comparing the information to internal and external source data including, among others, the economic forecasts utilized by the Company and third-party economic forecasts for selected assumptions. In addition, we performed procedures on the overall ALL amount, inclusive of the qualitative adjustments, by evaluating the Company s analysis of peers estimated current expected credit losses for loans to the Company s recorded ALL. 

Goodwill - Refer to Note A to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company s goodwill balance as of September 30, 2023, included within Intangible Assets, is related to the Company s single reporting unit. Goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis and between tests if circumstances such as material adverse changes in legal, business, regulatory and economic factors exist. The Company performed its annual impairment test as of August 31, 2023, using a quantitative impairment approach, and concluded the fair value of the single reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value and did not result in an impairment for the reporting unit. When performing the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment, the Company estimated fair value of its reporting unit using the market capitalization approach, based on its stock price, adjusted for the effect of a control premium. 
 
 Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of its reporting unit, including the selection of a control premium, performing audit procedures to evaluate goodwill for impairment required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the fair value of the reporting unit and selected control premium included the following procedures, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over management s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of fair value of the reporting unit and selection of the control premium. 
 63 

With the assistance of our fair value specialists we: 
 
 Evaluated the appropriateness of using the market capitalization approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. 
 Evaluated certain inputs and assumptions, within management s impairment analysis, including assessing including peer company transaction data, to determine applicability. 
 Performed procedures to assess the reasonableness of the control premium assumption used in the Company s market capitalization approach. 
 Assessed the mathematical accuracy of the valuation used in the impairment test.

to bps for a specific term, usually six to months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period. Principal forgiveness is generally not an available option for restructured loans. Before granting approval to modify a loan in a TDR, the borrower s ability to repay is evaluated, including: current income levels and debt to income ratio, borrower s credit score, payment history of the loan and updated evaluation of the secondary repayment source. The Company also modifies some loans that are not classified as TDRs as the modification is due to a restructuring where the effective interest rate on the debt is reduced to reflect a decrease in market interest rates. The Company's ACL reflects the effects of a TDR when management reasonably expects at the reporting date that a TDR will be executed with an individual borrower. 
 
 Non-accrual loans. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the judgment of management, the probability of collection of interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. The Company does not accrue interest on loans days or more past due. If payment is made on a loan so that the loan becomes less than 90 days past due, and the Company expects full collection of principal and interest, the loan is returned to full accrual status. Any interest ultimately collected is credited to income in the period of recovery. A loan is charged-off when the loss is estimable and it is confirmed that the borrower is not expected to be able to meet contractual obligations. 
 days delinquent. For commercial loans, consecutive payments on newly restructured loan terms are required prior to returning the loan to accrual status. In some instances, after the required consecutive payments are made, management will conclude that collection of the entire principal and interest due is still in doubt. In those instances, the loan will remain on non-accrual status. 
 We believe accrued interest receivable recorded as of September 30, 2023 is collectible.

 Most loans classified as TDRs are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Company about modifications due to temporary financial difficulties. Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success. The concession for these loans is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of to bps for a specific term, usually six to months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period. Principal forgiveness is not an available option for restructured loans.

 of TDRs as of September 30, 2023. The Company's ACL methodology takes into account the following performance indicators for restructured loans: 1) time since modification, 2) current payment status and 3) geographic area. 

We evaluate the credit quality of our commercial loans based on regulatory risk ratings and also consider other factors. Based on this evaluation, the loans are assigned a grade and classified as follows: 
 
 Pass the credit does not meet one of the definitions below. 
 
 Special mention A special mention credit is considered to be currently protected from loss but is potentially weak. No loss of principal or interest is foreseen; however, proper supervision and management attention is required to deter further deterioration in the credit. Assets in this category constitute some undue and unwarranted credit risk but not to the point of justifying a risk rating of substandard. The credit risk may be relatively minor yet constitutes an unwarranted risk in light of the circumstances surrounding a specific asset. 
 
 Substandard A substandard credit is an unacceptable credit. Additionally, repayment in the normal course is in jeopardy due to the existence of one or more well defined weaknesses. In these situations, loss of principal is likely if the weakness is not corrected. A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified will have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the collection or liquidation of the debt. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets risk rated substandard. 
 
 Doubtful A credit classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. The probability of loss is high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors that may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans. 
 
 Loss Credits classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. Losses should be taken in the period in which they are identified as uncollectible. Partial charge-off versus full charge-off may be taken if the collateral offers some identifiable protection.

 in 2023, compared to a provision of for 2022. In 2023, provisioning was largely due to adjustments for one large charge-off taken, offset by reduced unfunded commitment balances. For the year ended September 30, 2023, net charge-offs were , compared to recoveries of in the prior year. A loan is charged-off when the loss is estimable and it is confirmed that the borrower is not expected to be able to meet its contractual obligations.

 The Company has an asset quality review function that analyzes its loan portfolio and reports the results of the review to its Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The single-family residential, HELOC and consumer portfolios are evaluated based on their performance as a pool of loans, since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating, size or potential risk of loss. The construction, land, multi-family, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans are risk rated on a loan by loan basis to determine the relative risk inherent in specific borrowers or loans. Based on that risk rating, the loans are assigned a grade and classified as described in Note D "Loans Receivable."

 The Company periodically enters into certain interest rate swap agreements in order to provide commercial loan customers the ability to convert from variable to fixed interest rate payments, while the Company retains a variable rate loan. Under these agreements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan agreement and a swap agreement with the client. The swap agreement effectively converts the client s variable rate loan into a fixed rate. The Company enters into a corresponding swap agreement with a third party in order to offset its exposure on the variable and fixed components of the client's swap agreement. The interest rate swaps are derivatives under ASC 815, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The net impact to the statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2023 was a decrease in other income of .

Sources of noninterest income within the scope of the guidance include the following: 
 
 Deposit related and other service charges (recognized in Deposit Fee Income) : The Company's deposit accounts are governed by standardized contracts customary in the industry. Revenues are earned at a point in time or over time (monthly) from account maintenance fees and charges for specific transactions such as wire transfers, stop payment orders, overdrafts, debit card replacements, check orders and cashiers' checks. The Company s performance obligation related to each of these fees is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, at the time the service is provided (point in time or monthly). The Company is principal in each of these contracts. 
 
 Debit and credit card interchange fees (recognized in Deposit Fee Income) : The Company receives interchange fees from the debit card and credit card payment networks based on transactions involving debit or credit cards issued by the Company, generally measured as a percentage of the underlying transaction. Interchange fees from debit and credit card transactions are recognized as the transaction processing services are provided by the network. The Company acts as an agent in the card payment network arrangement so the interchange fees are recorded net of any expenses paid to the principal (the card payment networks in this case).

 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices in the United States of America. 
 
 The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making the assessment, the Company s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 version of its Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on its assessment, the Company s management believes that as of September 30, 2023, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on this criteria. 
 
 The Company s independent auditors, Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, have issued an audit report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in this annual report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of WaFd, Inc. 

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of WaFd, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Because management s assessment and our audit were conducted to meet the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA), management s assessment and our audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting included controls over the preparation of the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Instructions for Call Reports for Balance Sheet on schedule RC, Income Statement on schedule RI, and Changes in Bank Equity Capital on schedule RI-A. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 
 We have not examined and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management's statement referring to compliance with laws and regulations. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023, of the Company and our report dated November 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

It shall not be necessary to give any notice of the time and place of any meeting adjourned for one hundred twenty days or less (unless a new record date is fixed therefor), other than an announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. 2.6 Shareholders List for Meeting. At least ten days before each meeting of shareholders, a complete record of the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournment thereof, shall be made, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and number of shares registered in the name of each, which record shall be kept open to the examination of any shareholder (or the shareholders agent or attorney), for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to such meeting, at the Corporation s principal office or at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting. The record also shall be kept open at the 

time and place of such meeting for the inspection of any shareholder (or the shareholders agent or attorney). : 2.7 Quorum; Actions of Shareholders. Except as otherwise required by the Articles of Incorporation or the Washington Business Corporation Act: (a) A majority of the votes entitled to be cast on a matter by the holders of shares that, pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation or the Washington Business Corporation Act, are entitled to vote and be counted collectively upon such matter, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum of such shares at a meeting of shareholders. If less than a majority of such votes are represented at a meeting, a majority of the votes so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice if the new date, time or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment. Any business may be transacted at a reconvened meeting that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called, provided a quorum is present or represented thereat. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting other than solely to object to holding the meeting or transacting business thereat, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and any adjournment thereof (unless a new record date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting) notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. (b) If a quorum exists, in all matters other than the election of directors, the matter shall be approved if the votes cast in favor of the matter by the holders of the shares entitled to vote thereon exceed the votes cast against the matter by such holders. Directors shall be elected in the manner set forth in the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation. 2.8 Meetings by Communication Equipment. Shareholders may participate in any meeting of the shareholders by means of, or solely through the use of, remote communication. Participation by remote communication is subject to any guidelines and procedures adopted by the Board of Directors. Notice of the meeting must specify how a shareholder may participate in the meeting by means of remote communication, and the Corporation will implement reasonable measures to (i) verify that each person participating remotely as a shareholder or proxy holder is a shareholder or proxy holder, and (ii) provide each person participating remotely as a shareholder or proxy holder a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the shareholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with those proceedings. Participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting. 2.9 Voting of Shares. Except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws or to the extent that voting rights of the shares of any class or classes are specified, limited or denied by the Articles of Incorporation, each shareholder, on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of 

shareholders, shall have one vote for each share of stock registered in his name on the books of the Corporation. 2.10 Closing of Transfer Books and Fixing of the Record Date. For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, the Board of Directors shall fix in advance a record date for any such determination of shareholders, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than seventy days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten days (twenty days in the case of a meeting of shareholders referred to in the proviso clause to the first sentence of Section 2.5 hereof) prior to the date on which the particular action requiring such determination of shareholders is to be taken. 2.11 Proxies. A shareholder may vote either in person or by proxy. A shareholder or the shareholder's agent or attorney-in-fact may appoint a proxy to vote for the shareholder by submitting an executed appointment form or an electronic transmission of the appointment to the person authorized to tabulate votes for the Corporation. An appointment of proxy is valid for eleven (11) months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment form or electronic transmission. 2.12 Waiver of Notice. A waiver of any notice required to be given any shareholder, executed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein for the meeting, shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice. Further, notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting will be deemed to be a waiver by any shareholder by attendance thereat in person or by proxy, unless such shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting. 2.13 Voting of Shares in the Name of Two or More Persons. When ownership stands in the name of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or if two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary of the Corporation is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, at any meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation any one or more of such shareholders may cast, in person or by proxy, all votes to which such ownership is entitled. In the event an attempt is made to cast conflicting votes, in person or by proxy, by the several persons in whose names shares of stock stand, the vote or votes to which those persons are entitled shall be cast as directed by a majority of those holding such stock and present in person or by proxy at such meeting, but no votes shall be cast for such stock if a majority cannot agree. 

2.14 Voting of Shares by Certain Holders. Shares standing in the name of another corporation may be voted by an officer, agent or proxy as the bylaws of such corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the Board of Directors of such corporation may determine. Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian or conservator may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into his name. Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held by him without a transfer of such shares into his name. Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into his name if authority to do so is contained in an appropriate order of the court or other public authority by which such receiver was appointed. A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred. 2.15 Proposals. At an annual meeting of the shareholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a shareholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely a shareholder s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than ninety days prior to the anniversary date of the mailing of proxy materials by the Corporation in connection with the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation. A shareholder s notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting, (b) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation s books, of the shareholder proposing such business, (c) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the shareholder, and (d) any material interest of the shareholder in such business. The chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Article II, Section 2.15, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. This provision is not a limitation on any other applicable laws and regulations. 2.16 Inspectors. For each meeting of shareholders, the Board of Directors shall appoint one or more inspectors of election, who shall make a written report of such meeting. If for any meeting the inspector(s) appointed by the Board of Directors shall be unable to act or the Board 

of Directors shall fail to appoint any inspector, one or more inspectors shall be appointed at the meeting by the chairman thereof. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability. An inspector or inspectors shall (i) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, (ii) determine the shares represented at a meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. An inspector or inspectors shall not accept a ballot, proxy or vote, nor any revocations thereof or changes thereto, after the closing of the polls for a matter upon which the shareholders vote and may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist them in the performance of their duties. Inspectors need not be shareholders and may not be nominees for election as directors. ARTICLE III. CAPITAL STOCK 3.1 Stock. The shares of the Corporation may be represented by certificates or may be issued in uncertificated or book entry form. Upon request to the Corporation, each shareholder shall be entitled to a certificate in such form as determined by the Board of Directors. Certificates of stock shall be issued in numerical order, and each shareholder shall be entitled to a certificate executed by the Chairman of the Board or the Vice Chairman, and the Secretary or the Treasurer, and may be sealed with the seal of the Corporation or facsimile thereof. The signatures of such officers may be facsimiles if the certificate is executed on behalf of a transfer agent, or registered by a registrar, other than the Corporation itself or an employee of the Corporation. If an officer who has executed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon such certificate ceases to be an officer before the certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if the person were an officer on the date of issue. Each certificate of stock shall state: (a) that the Corporation is organized under the laws of the State of Washington; (b) the name of the person to whom issued; (c) the number and class of shares and the designation of the series, if any, which such certificate represents; and (d) the par value of each share represented by such certificate, or a statement that such shares are without par value. 

3.2 Transfers. (a) Transfers of certificated stock shall be made only upon the stock transfer books of the Corporation, kept at the registered office of the Corporation or at its principal place of business, or at the office of its transfer agent or registrar, and before a new certificate is issued the old certificate shall be surrendered for cancellation. The Board of Directors may, by resolution, open a share register in any state of the United States, and may employ an agent or agents to keep such register, and to record transfers of shares therein. (b) In the case of uncertificated or book entry shares, transfer shall be made upon receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered owner of such shares, or from a duly authorized attorney or from an individual or entity presenting proper evidence of succession, assignment, or authorization to transfer the stock. (c) Certificated shares of stock shall be transferred by delivery of the certificates therefor, accompanied either by an assignment in writing on the back of the certificate or an assignment separate from the certificate, or by a written power of attorney to sell, assign and transfer the same, executed by the holder of said certificate. No shares of stock shall be transferred on the books of the Corporation until the outstanding certificates therefor have been surrendered to the Corporation. (d) A written restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of a certificate evidencing stock of the Corporation, if permitted by the Washington Business Corporation Act and noted conspicuously on such certificate, may be enforced against the holder of the restricted certificate or any successor or transferee of the holder, including an executor, administrator, trustee, guardian or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of the holder. 3.3 Registered Owner. Registered shareholders shall be treated by the Corporation as the holders in fact of the stock standing in their respective names and the Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in any share on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as expressly provided by the Washington Business Corporation Act, provided that the corporation may establish a procedure by which the beneficial owner of shares that are registered in the name of a nominee is recognized by the Corporation as the shareholder to the extent permitted by the Washington Business Corporation Act. 3.4 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. The Corporation may issue (i) a new certificate of stock or (ii) uncertificated shares in place of any certificate or certificates previously issued by 

it which is alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate. 3.5 Fractional Shares or Scrip. The Corporation may (a) issue fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder to exercise voting rights, to receive dividends thereon and to participate in any of the assets of the Corporation in the event of liquidation; (b) arrange for the disposition of fractional interests by those entitled thereto; (c) pay in cash the fair value of fractions of a share as of the time when those entitled to receive such shares are determined; or (d) issue scrip in registered or bearer form which shall entitle the holder to receive a certificate for a full share upon the surrender of such scrip aggregating a full share. 3.6 Shares of Another Corporation. Shares owned by the Corporation in another corporation, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the Board of Directors may determine or, in the absence of such determination, by the President of the Corporation. ARTICLE IV. BOARD OF DIRECTORS 4.1 Powers. All corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of, a Board of Directors, which may exercise all such authority and powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the shareholders. 4.2 Classification and Term.

Except as otherwise fixed pursuant to the provisions of Article 3 of the Corporation s Articles of Incorporation relating to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect directors, any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors, including any vacancy created by reason of an increase in the number of directors, may be filled by a majority vote of the directors then in office, whether or not a quorum is present, or by a sole remaining director, and any director so chosen shall hold office until the next shareholders meeting at which directors are elected and until such director s successor shall have been elected and qualified. 4.5 Removal of Directors.

Board of Directors, or in the absence of such specification, in the manner and with the notice required for special meetings of the Board of Directors. 4.8 Waiver of Notice. Attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. A waiver of notice executed by the director or directors, whether before or after the time stated for the meeting, shall be equivalent to the giving of notice. 4.9 Quorum: Actions of the Board of Directors. Except as may be otherwise specifically provided by law, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, at all meetings of the Board of Directors, a majority of the entire Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors.

Any action required or which may be taken at a meeting of the directors, or of a committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if one or more written consents setting forth the action so taken or to be taken, shall be executed by all of the directors, or all of the members of the committee, as the case may be, and such consents are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be. Such consent shall have the same effect as a unanimous vote and shall be effective when the last director executes the consent, unless the consent specifies a later effective date. 4.11 Action by Directors by Communications Equipment.

The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors, a stated salary as director and/or such other compensation as may be fixed by the Board of Directors. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for serving on committees of the Board of Directors. No such payments shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. 4.15 Nominations of Directors.

However, with respect to any Purchase Period, no Participant shall be eligible to purchase more than two thousand (2,000) shares of Stock or such lesser number of shares as would cause the Participant to remain within the limitations set forth in Section 13. (c) Once enrolled, a Participant will continue to participate in the Plan for each succeeding Purchase Period until he or she terminates participation in accordance with Section 9 or ceases to qualify as an Eligible Person. A Participant who withdraws from the Plan in accordance with Section 9 may again become a Participant in a subsequent Purchase Period, if he or she then is an Eligible Person, by following the procedure described in Section 5(a). Section 6. Purchase Price. The Purchase Price for each share of Stock within a given Purchase Period shall be equal to ninety-five percent (95 of the Fair Market Value of such share on the Date of Exercise for such Purchase Period.

Payroll deductions, as designated by the Participant pursuant to Section 5(a), shall commence with the first paycheck issued during the Purchase Period and shall be deducted from each subsequent paycheck throughout the Purchase Period; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled to discontinue payroll deductions for a Participant during a Purchase Period without prior notice to the extent that the Company determines that the payroll deductions for such Participant during such Purchase Period would cause the Participant to exceed the limitations set forth in Sections 5 or 13, or that the maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan have been issued or committed for issuance; provided, further, that the Company will recommence payroll deductions for such Participant on the first day of the next Purchase Period to the extent the limitation set forth in Section 13 has not been exceeded, except where the maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan have been issued or committed for issuance. If a Participant desires to decrease the rate of payroll withholding during a Purchase Period, he or she may do so one time during a Purchase Period by submitting the prescribed percentage change form with the Stock Administrator. Such decrease will be effective no later than the first day of the second payroll period which begins following the receipt of the new percentage change form. If a Participant desires to increase or decrease the rate of payroll withholding, he or she may do so (subject to the limitations set forth in the Plan) effective for the next Purchase Period by submitting a new percentage change form with the Stock Administrator on or before the date imposed and communicated to Eligible Persons by the Stock Administrator, and if none is so imposed and/or communicated, then no later than five (5) days before the Purchase Period for which such change is to be effective. Section 8. Plan Accounts; Purchase of Shares. 

(a) The Company will maintain a Plan Account on its books in the name of each Participant. At the close of each pay period, the amount deducted from the Participant s Compensation will be credited to the Participant s Plan Account. (b) As of each Date of Exercise, the amount then in the Participant s Plan Account will be divided by the Purchase Price, and the number of shares which results (computed to three decimal places and subject to the limitations described in Sections 5(b), 8(c) and 13) shall be purchased from the Company, or by the Company in the open market, with the funds in the Participant s Plan Account. The number of shares of Stock so purchased shall be delivered to a brokerage account designated by the Plan Administrator and kept in such account pursuant to the enrollment form (which shall be uniform) between each Participant and the Company and subject to the conditions described therein (which may include, without limitation, restrictions on transferability of the shares of Stock so purchased, and which shall include restrictions on transferability to the extent the Participant would be deemed an underwriter of the Company s securities in the absence of compliance with Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended). (c) In the event that the aggregate number of shares which all Participants elect to purchase during a Purchase Period shall exceed the number of shares remaining available for issuance under the Plan, then the number of shares to which each Participant shall become entitled shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares available for issuance by a fraction the numerator of which is the sum of the number of shares the Participant has elected to purchase pursuant to Section 5, and the denominator of which is the sum of the number of shares which all employees have elected to purchase pursuant to Section 5. Any cash amount remaining in the Participant s Plan Account under these circumstances shall be refunded to the Participant. (d) Any amount remaining in the Participant s Plan Account, including any amounts remaining because the maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan have been issued or committed for issuance as a result of Section 8(c), above, shall be refunded to the Participant in cash, without interest, within thirty (30) days of the end of the applicable Purchase Period; provided, however, that amounts remaining after the application of the rounding of fractional shares contemplated by Section 8(b) will be retained in a Participant s Plan Account until the subsequent purchase period unless the Participant requests that such amounts be refunded, in which case the refund will be made in the same manner as contemplated by the initial clause of this sentence. (e) Unless otherwise determined by the Plan Administrator, as soon as practicable following the end of each Purchase Period, the Company shall deliver to each Participant a Plan Account statement setting forth the amount of payroll deductions, the Purchase Price, the number of shares purchased and the remaining cash balance, if any. Section 9. Withdrawal from the Plan. A Participant may elect to withdraw from participation under the Plan at any time up to thirty (30) days prior to the last day of a Purchase Period by submitting the prescribed withdrawal form with the Stock Administrator. As soon as practicable after a withdrawal, payroll deductions shall cease and all amounts credited to the Participant s Plan Account will be 

refunded in cash, without interest. A Participant who has withdrawn from the Plan shall not be a Participant in future Purchase Periods, unless he or she again enrolls in accordance with the provisions of Section 5. The Plan Administrator or the Stock Administrator may reject or delay acceptance of a Participant s enrollment if it is determined in the sole discretion of the Plan Administrator or the Stock Administrator that the timing or effect of an application would create undue risk to the Company or the Participant. Section 10. Effect of Termination of Employment or Death. (a) Termination of employment as an Eligible Person for any reason, including death, shall be treated as an automatic withdrawal from the Plan under Section 9. A transfer from one Participating Company to another shall not be treated as a termination of employment. (b) A Participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any shares and cash, if any, from the Participant s Account under the Plan in the event of such Participant s death subsequent to the purchase of shares but prior to delivery to him or her of such shares and cash. In addition, a Participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any cash from the Participant s Account under the Plan in the event of such Participant s death prior to the last day of a Purchase Period. Any such designation shall be made on a form prescribed by the Stock Administrator or otherwise in a form acceptable to the Stock Administrator in its sole discretion. (c) Such designation of beneficiary may be changed by the Participant at any time by submitting the prescribed designation of beneficiary change form with the Stock Administrator, on a form prescribed by the Stock Administrator or otherwise in a form acceptable to the Stock Administrator in its sole discretion. In the event of the death of a Participant in the absence of a valid designation of a beneficiary who is living at the time of such Participant s death, the Company shall deliver such shares and/or cash to the executor or administrator of the estate of the Participant; or if no such executor or administrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its discretion, may deliver such shares and/or cash to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of the Participant; or if no spouse, dependent or relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate. Section 11. Rights Not Transferable. The rights or interests of any Participant in the Plan, or in any Stock or moneys to which he or she may be entitled under the Plan, shall not be transferable by voluntary or involuntary assignment or by operation of law, or by any other manner other than as permitted by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and during the Participant s lifetime, purchase rights in the Plan shall be exercisable only by the Participant. If a Participant in any manner attempts to transfer, assign or otherwise encumber his or her rights or interest under the Plan, other than as permitted by will or the laws of descent and distribution, such act shall be treated as an automatic withdrawal under Section 9. Section 12. Recapitalization, Etc. (a) The aggregate number of shares of Stock offered under the Plan, the number and price of shares which any Participant has elected to purchase pursuant to Section 5 and the 

maximum number of shares which a Participant may elect to purchase under the Plan in any Purchase Period shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Stock resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of shares or any other capital adjustment, the payment of a stock dividend, or other increase or decrease in such shares affected without receipt of consideration by the Company. In the event of any such event, the Plan Administrator shall make such adjustments as it deems necessary and equitable in its sole discretion, with respect to the number of shares issued or issuable under the Plan, the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan, the determination of Fair Market Value, and any other factors affected by such an event. (b) In the event of a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, this Plan shall terminate, and all amounts which each Participant has paid towards the Purchase Price of Stock hereunder, and which are held in such Participant s account in cash prior to the purchase of Stock, shall be refunded, without interest. (c) In the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, an acquisition of the Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation, in which instance this Plan is not assumed by the successor or acquiror, the Purchase Period shall be shortened by setting a new Date of Exercise (the New Exercise Date ), which date shall occur prior to the effective time of the event giving rise to such adjustment. The Company shall notify each Participant in writing at least five (5) days prior to the New Exercise Date, that the Date of Exercise for the Purchase Period has been changed to the New Exercise Date and that the purchase shall automatically occur on the New Exercise Date, unless prior to such date the Participant has withdrawn from the Purchase Period pursuant to Section 9. (d) The Plan shall in no event be construed to restrict in any way the Company s right to undertake a dissolution, liquidation, merger, consolidation, reorganization or other corporate transaction. Section 13. Limitation on Stock Ownership. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no Participant shall be permitted to elect to participate in the Plan (i) if such Participant, immediately after his or her election to participate, would own stock possessing five percent (5 or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or any Company Affiliate, (ii) if such participation would require the proposed Participant to file any notice under, or to seek the consent or non-objection of any bank regulatory authority with respect to, the Change in Bank Control Act, the Bank Holding Company Act, the Washington Bank Act, or any other federal or state banking law or regulation, or (iii) if under the terms of the Plan the rights of the Employee to purchase Stock under this Plan and all other qualified employee stock purchase plans of the Company or its Company Affiliates would accrue at a rate which exceeds fifty thousand dollars 50,000) of Fair Market Value of such Stock (determined at the time such right is granted) for each calendar year for which such right is outstanding at any time. For purposes of this Section 13, ownership of stock shall be determined by the attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code, and Participants shall be considered to own any stock which they have a right to purchase under this or any other stock plan. 

Section 14. No Rights as an Employee. Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to give any person the right to remain in the employ of a Participating Company. Each Participating Company reserves the right to terminate the employment of any person at any time and for any reason. Section 15. Rights as a Shareholder. A Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any shares he or she may have a right to purchase under the Plan until the date of issuance to the brokerage account designated by the Plan Administrator the shares of Stock issued pursuant to the Plan. Section 16. Use of Funds. All payroll deductions received or held by the Company under the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and the Company shall not be obligated to segregate such payroll deductions in separate accounts. Section 17. Amendment or Termination of the Plan. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Board of Directors shall have the right to amend, modify or terminate the Plan at any time without notice. An amendment of the Plan shall be subject to shareholder approval only to the extent required by applicable laws, regulations or rules. The Plan shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) such date as is determined by the Company in its sole discretion or (ii) the date on which all shares available for issuance under the Plan shall have been sold pursuant to purchase rights exercised under the Plan. Section 18. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue. The Plan shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Washington. Any disputes hereunder shall be decided in the federal or state courts located in King County, Washington, which jurisdiction and venue shall be mandatory and not elective, and each Participant and each applicant to become a Participant voluntarily submits to such jurisdiction and venue. By becoming or applying to become a Participant, each person receiving or applying to receive Stock submits irrevocably to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and each does thereby waive forever any right to seek removal to any other jurisdiction or to seek to apply the doctrine of forum non conveniens. The termination of a Participant s enrollment in the Plan shall not discharge or modify the submission to jurisdiction and venue as set forth herein. The provisions of the Plan shall be deemed severable. In the event any such provision is determined to be unlawful or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or by reason of a change in an applicable statute, the Plan shall continue to exist as though such provision had never been included therein (or, in the case of a change in an applicable statute, had been deleted as of the date of such change). Section 19. Shareholder Approval.

Such shareholder approval shall be prior to the earlier to occur of: (a) the first Date of Exercise of the Plan and (b) the twelve (12) month anniversary of the adoption of the Plan; provided, however, that such approval may not occur prior to twelve (12) months before the adoption of the Plan. In the event the Plan shall not have been approved by the shareholders of the Company prior to the first Date of Exercise of the Plan, the Plan shall terminate and all purchase rights granted under the Plan shall be canceled and become null and void. Section 20. Section 409A. The Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code, to the extent applicable. All options granted under the Plan shall be construed and administered such that such option either (i) qualifies for an exemption from the requirements of section 409A of the Code or (ii) satisfies the requirements of section 409A of the Code. If an option is subject to section 409A of the Code, the exercise of such option shall only be made in a manner and upon an event permitted under section 409A of the Code and in no event shall an Eligible Person, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year in which an exercise occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, although options are intended to be exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of section 409A of the Code, and the Plan shall be interpreted accordingly, the Company does not warrant that any option will qualify for favorable tax treatment under section 409A of the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or foreign law. The Company shall not be liable to any Eligible Person for any tax the Eligible Person might owe as a result of the grant or exercise of an option, or holding of any shares of Stock received upon exercise of the option, under the Plan. Section 21. Withholding Taxes. All acquisitions and sales of Stock under the Plan shall be subject to applicable federal (including FICA), state and local tax withholding requirements if the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority requires such withholding. The Company may require that Participants pay to the Company (or make other arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the payment of) the amount of any federal, state or local taxes that the Company is required to withhold with respect to the purchase of Stock or the sale of Stock acquired under the Plan, or instead deduct from the Participant s wages or other compensation the amount of any withholding taxes due with respect to the purchase of Stock or the sale of Stock acquired under the Plan.

Clawback Policy WaFd, Inc. Clawback Policy Effective 10/2/23 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2023 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 3 1. Objective WaFd, Inc. (the Company is committed to conducting business with integrity in accordance with high ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. This includes the Company s commitment to comply with all laws, rules and regulations, including those applicable to the presentation of the Company s financial information to the public. As a result, the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board has adopted this Clawback Policy (this Policy ), which provides for the recovery of certain executive officer incentive-based compensation in the event of an accounting restatement. This Policy is adopted pursuant to and intended to comply with Rule 5608 (Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation) of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq so long as the Company s securities are listed on Nasdaq. 2. Administration This Policy will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or in the absence of such a committee a majority of the independent directors (within the meaning of Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2)) serving on the Board (the Committee ). Except as limited by law, the Committee will have full power, authority, and sole and exclusive discretion to construe, interpret and administer this Policy. The Committee will interpret this Policy consistent with Nasdaq Rule 5608 (Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation) and any Nasdaq guidance issued thereunder, the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), and any other applicable laws, rules or regulations governing the mandatory recovery of compensation, as such laws, rules or regulations may change, be interpreted or evolve from time to time. Any determinations made by the Committee will be made in its sole discretion and will be final, conclusive and binding on all affected individuals. 3. Covered Executives This Policy will cover the Company s current and former Executive Officers as determined by the Board from time to time in accordance with Rule 16a-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will include the Company s chief executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any executive vice president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division or function (such as sales, administration or finance), any other officer that performs a policy making function for the Company, any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company and Executive Officers of the Company s 

Clawback Policy WaFd, Inc. Clawback Policy Effective 10/2/23 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2023 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 4 subsidiaries if such individuals perform such policy-making functions for the Company, and any other officer whose compensation is determined by the Committee per authorization granted by the Board (collectively, the Covered Executives and each, a Covered Executive ). This Policy will cover the Company s Covered Executives without regard to whether any misconduct occurred or whether a Covered Executive had any responsibility for the erroneous financial statements. Policy-making function is not intended to include policy-making functions that are not significant. The identification of an Executive Officer for purposes of this Policy would include at a minimum executive officers identified by the Company pursuant to Item 401(b) of SEC Regulation S-K. 4. Compensation Covered The Policy will apply to all incentive-based compensation paid, granted, earned, vested or otherwise awarded to a Covered Executive, and includes, but is not limited to annual bonuses or incentive compensation, and other short and long term cash incentive awards, stock options, restricted stock awards, performance share awards, and other equity-based awards. Notwithstanding the generality of and in addition to the foregoing, as required under Nasdaq Rule 5608 (Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation), this Policy will apply to all Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a person (in each case, as such terms are defined below): After beginning service as an Executive Officer of the Company; Who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for that Incentive-Based Compensation; While the Company has a class of securities listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange or a national securities association; and During the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement (as defined below), plus any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years; provided, however, that a transition period between the last day of the Company s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to 12 months would be deemed a completed fiscal year; and provided, further, that the Company s obligation to recover erroneously awarded compensation is not dependent on if or when the restated financial statements are filed. For purposes of this Policy, a Restatement means an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. 

Clawback Policy WaFd, Inc. Clawback Policy Effective 10/2/23 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2023 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 5 For purpose of determining the relevant recovery period, the date that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement is the earlier to occur of: (i) the date the Company s Board, a committee of the Board or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement; or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Restatement. 5. Authority and Obligation to Recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation In the event of a Restatement and if required under Nasdaq Rule 5608 (Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation), the Company must reasonably promptly recover any Erroneously Awarded Compensation (as defined below) in compliance with this Policy and Nasdaq Rule 5608 (Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation), except to the extent one of the three conditions below is met and the Committee has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable. (A) The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered and the Company has made a reasonable attempt to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation, has documented such reasonable attempt(s) to recover and provided that documentation to Nasdaq. (B) Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022 and the Company has obtained an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to Nasdaq, that recovery would result in such a violation and has provided such opinion to Nasdaq. (C) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or 411(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder. The term Erroneously Awarded Compensation as used in this Policy means that amount of Incentive- Based Compensation Received (as such terms are defined below) that exceeds the amount of Incentive- Based Compensation that otherwise would have been Received had it been determined based on the restated amounts and must be computed without regard to any taxes paid. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in a Restatement, the amount must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-based Compensation 

Clawback Policy WaFd, Inc. Clawback Policy Effective 10/2/23 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2023 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 6 was Received. The Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq. The term Incentive-Based Compensation as used in this Policy means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure. The term Financial Reporting Measures as used in this Policy means measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. Financial reporting measures include, without limitation, stock price and total shareholder return, and may include non-GAAP financial measures. A financial reporting measure need not be presented within the Company s financial statements or included in an SEC filing to constitute a financial reporting measure for this purpose. Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed Received as such term is used in this Policy by an Executive Officer in the Company s fiscal period during which the financial reporting measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, Incentive-Based Compensation is intended to be interpreted and construed broadly and includes with respect to any plan that takes into account incentive- based compensation (other than a tax-qualified plan) any amount contributed to a notional account based on erroneously awarded compensation and any earnings accrued to date on that notional account. Such plans include without limitation long-term disability plans, life insurance plans, supplemental executive retirement plans and other compensation, if it is based on incentive-based compensation. 6. Method of Recovery The Committee will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recovering Incentive Compensation or Erroneously Awarded Compensation hereunder, which may include, without limitation, any one or more of the following: requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive Compensation previously paid; seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer or other disposition of any equity-based awards; cancelling or rescinding some or all outstanding vested or unvested equity-based awards; adjusting or withholding from unpaid compensation or other set-off; cancelling or setting-off against planned future grants of equity-based awards; and/or any other method authorized by applicable law or contract.

Policy Not Exclusive Any recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, incentive or equity compensation plan or award or other agreement and any other legal rights or remedies available to the Company. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, to the extent that the requirements under the provisions of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or other applicable law are broader than the provisions in this Policy, the provisions of such law will apply. 9. No Indemnification The Company will not indemnify or agree to indemnify any Covered Executive against the loss of Erroneously Awarded Compensation or Incentive Compensation that is subject to this Policy nor will the Company pay or agree to pay any insurance premium to cover the loss of Erroneously Awarded Compensation or Incentive Compensation. 10.
