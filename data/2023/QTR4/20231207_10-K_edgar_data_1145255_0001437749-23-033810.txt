 BUSINESS 

GENERAL 
 
 Hennessy Advisors, Inc. (the Company, we, us, or our is a publicly traded investment management firm whose primary business activity is providing investment advisory services to a family of 16 open-end mutual funds (collectively, the Hennessy Mutual Funds and one exchange traded fund ETF branded as the Hennessy Funds. We are committed to providing superior service to investors and employing a consistent and disciplined approach to investing based on a buy and hold philosophy that rejects the idea of market timing. Our goal is to provide products that investors can have confidence in, knowing their money is invested as promised and with their best interests in mind. Our firm was founded on these principles over 30 years ago, and the same principles guide us today. 
 
 We earn revenues primarily by providing investment advisory services to the Hennessy Funds and secondarily by providing shareholder services to investors in the Hennessy Mutual Funds. Investment advisory services include managing the composition of each fund s portfolio (including the purchase, retention, and disposition of portfolio securities in accordance with each fund s investment objectives, policies, and restrictions), monitoring each fund s compliance with its investment objectives and restrictions and federal securities laws, monitoring the liquidity of each fund, reviewing each fund s investment performance, overseeing the selection and continued employment of sub-advisors and monitoring such sub-advisors adherence to the fund s investment objectives, policies, and restrictions, overseeing other service providers, maintaining in house marketing and distribution departments, preparing and distributing regulatory reports, and overseeing distribution of the funds through third party financial institutions. Shareholder services include maintaining a toll free number that the current investors in the Hennessy Funds may call to ask questions about their accounts or the funds and actively participating as a liaison between investors in the Hennessy Funds and U.S. Bank Global Fund Services, the Hennessy Funds administrator. The fees we receive for investment advisory and shareholder services are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the Hennessy Funds. Accordingly, our total revenue increases or decreases as our average assets under management rises or falls. The percentage amount of the investment advisory fees varies from fund to fund, but the percentage amount of the shareholder service fees is consistent across all Hennessy Mutual Funds. 
 
 We have delegated the day to day portfolio management responsibilities to sub advisors, subject to our oversight, for some of the Hennessy Funds. In exchange for these sub advisory services, we pay each sub advisor a fee out of our own assets, which is calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the sub advised funds. Accordingly, the sub advisory fees we pay increase or decrease as our average assets under management in our sub advised funds increases or decreases, respectively. 
 
 Our average assets under management for fiscal year 2023 was 3.0 billion, and our total assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2023 was 3.0 billion. Our business strategy centers on (i) organic growth through our marketing, sales, and distribution efforts and (ii) growth through strategic purchases of management related assets.

Multi-Asset Funds 
 
 Three of the Hennessy Funds are categorized as Multi-Asset products. Of those three funds, two utilize a quantitative investment strategy and one is actively managed. These funds follow a more conservative investment strategy focused on generating income and providing an alternative to funds containing only equity stocks. Following is a brief description of the investment objectives and principal investment strategies of the Hennessy Funds in the Multi Asset product category: 

Hennessy Total Return Fund (Investor Class symbol HDOGX). The Hennessy Total Return Fund seeks total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income, by investing approximately 50 of its assets in the 10 highest dividend-yielding common stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (known as the Dogs of the Dow in roughly equal dollar amounts and the remaining 50 of its assets in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of less than one year. This fund then utilizes a borrowing strategy that allows the fund s performance to approximate what it would be if the fund had an asset allocation of roughly 75 Dogs of the Dow stocks and 25 U.S. Treasury securities. 

Hennessy Equity and Income Fund (Investor Class symbol HEIFX; Institutional Class symbol HEIIX). The Hennessy Equity and Income Fund seeks income and long-term capital appreciation with reduced volatility of returns by investing up to 70 of its assets in common stock, preferred stock, and equity like instruments and its remaining assets in asset backed and mortgage backed securities and debt instruments, including high yield bonds. 

Hennessy Balanced Fund (Investor Class symbol HBFBX).

Sector and Specialty Funds 
 
 Nine of the Hennessy Funds are categorized as Sector and Specialty products. Of those nine funds, one is designed as an index fund and the other eight are actively managed, and each focuses on a niche sector of the stock market. Following is a brief description of the investment objectives and principal investment strategies of the Hennessy Funds in the Sector and Specialty product category:

The Hennessy Energy Transition Fund seeks total return by investing in companies operating in the United States across the full spectrum of the energy supply/demand value chain, including traditional upstream, midstream, and downstream energy companies, as well as renewable energy companies and energy end users.

 Development of New Investment Strategies and Expanding Our Product Offerings

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, SOURCES OF REVENUES, AND 12B-1 PLANS 
 
 We earn revenues primarily by providing investment advisory services to the Hennessy Funds and secondarily by providing shareholder services to investors in the Hennessy Mutual Funds. The fees we receive for these services are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the Hennessy Funds. In addition, the sub advisory fees that we pay are also calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the sub advised Hennessy Funds. The amount of our assets under management fluctuates as a result of organic inflows (purchases of shares of the Hennessy Funds by new or existing investors), acquisition inflows, outflows (redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds by investors), and market appreciation or depreciation.

The investment advisory agreements also provide that we are responsible for performing any ordinary clerical and bookkeeping services needed by the Hennessy Funds that are not provided by the funds custodian, administrator, or transfer agent. The Funds Board of Trustees comprises five trustees who are not interested persons of the Hennessy Funds (the disinterested trustees and Neil J.

We waive a portion of our fees with respect to the Hennessy Midstream Fund, the Hennessy Technology Fund, and the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF to comply with contractual expense ratio limitations. The fee waivers are calculated daily by the Hennessy Funds accountants at U.S. Bank Global Fund Services, reviewed by management, and then charged to expense monthly as offsets to our revenues. Each waived fee is then deducted from investment advisory fee income and reduces the aggregate amount of advisory fees we receive from such fund in the subsequent month. Total fee waivers during each of fiscal year 2023 and 2022 were 0.1 million. To date, we have only waived fees based on contractual obligations, but we have the ability to waive fees at our discretion. Any decision to waive fees would apply only on a going forward basis.

Our investment advisory agreements must be renewed annually (except in limited circumstances) by (a) the Funds Board of Trustees or the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable Hennessy Fund and (b) the vote of a majority of the disinterested trustees. If an investment advisory agreement is not renewed, it terminates automatically. There are two additional circumstances in which an investment advisory agreement terminates. First, an investment advisory agreement automatically terminates if we assign it to another advisor (assignment includes indirect assignment, which is the transfer of our common stock in sufficient quantities deemed to constitute a controlling block). Second, an investment advisory agreement may be terminated prior to its expiration upon 60 days written notice by either the applicable Hennessy Fund or us. 
 
 Sub-Advisory Agreements and Fees 
 
 We have delegated the day-to-day portfolio management responsibilities to sub advisors, subject to our oversight, for some of the Hennessy Funds. In each case, the sub advisor entity or the individuals working at the sub advisor entity is the same entity or are the same individuals who advised the fund prior to our purchase of the assets related to the management of such fund. The provision of sub advisory services must be in accordance with the applicable Hennessy Fund s sub advisory agreement, Prospectus, and Statement of Additional Information. The services that each sub advisor provides to the applicable Hennessy Fund pursuant to the terms of the sub advisory agreement include, among other things, the following (except these responsibilities are divided between Stance Capital and Vident Advisory for the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF): 

acting as portfolio manager for the fund, which includes managing the composition of the fund s portfolio (including the purchase, retention, and disposition of portfolio securities in accordance with the fund s investment objectives, policies, and restrictions), seeking best execution for the fund s portfolio, managing the use of soft dollars for the fund, and managing proxy voting for the fund; 

ensuring that its compliance programs include policies and procedures relevant to the fund and the sub advisor s duties as a portfolio manager to the fund; 

for each annual report of the fund, preparing a written summary of the fund s performance during the most recent 12 month period; and 

providing a quarterly certification to Funds Board of Trustees regarding trading and allocation practices, supervisory matters, the sub advisor s compliance program (including its code of ethics), compliance with the fund s policies, and general firm updates.

In exchange for sub-advisory services, we pay sub advisory fees to the sub advisors out of our own assets. Sub-advisory fees are calculated as a percentage of the applicable fund s average daily net asset value. The following table lists each of our sub advised funds, the sub advisor for such fund, and the percentage used to calculate the annual sub advisory fees payable by us to such fund s sub advisor as of the end of fiscal year 2023:

The sub advisory agreements must be renewed annually in the same manner as the investment advisory agreements and are subject to the same termination provisions, including automatic termination in the event the agreement is assigned. Assignment is generally defined under the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act to include direct assignments as well as assignments that are deemed to occur due to the change in control of the investment advisor, which includes us or one of the sub advisors that we have engaged on behalf of certain of the Hennessy Funds. However, a transaction is not an assignment under the 1940 Act or the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act") if it does not result in a change of actual control or management of us or, in the context of a sub-advisor, a change of actual control or management of the sub-advisor.

If a sub advisor experienced a change of control but we did not, we could continue acting as an advisor to the applicable Hennessy Fund, but the shareholders of such Hennessy Fund would have to approve a new sub advisory agreement for the sub advisor. Because obtaining shareholder approval for a new sub advisor can be costly both in terms of expense and time, we recently sought and received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC to operate under a manager of managers structure. The manager of managers structure permits us to appoint and replace unaffiliated sub-advisors and to enter into and make material amendments to the related sub-advisory agreements on behalf of the Hennessy Funds without shareholder approval, but subject in each case to the approval of the Hennessy Funds Board of Trustees. Under the manager of managers structure, we have ultimate responsibility, subject to oversight by the Hennessy Funds Board of Trustees, for overseeing the Hennessy Funds unaffiliated sub-advisors and recommending their hiring, termination, or replacement. Even with the exemptive order from the SEC, we cannot implement the manager of managers structure on behalf of a particular Hennessy Fund until the shareholders of such Hennessy Fund approve its implementation. 
 
 We recently obtained shareholder approval for the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF to operate under a manager of managers structure and are evaluating the timing and process for obtaining shareholder approval for the Hennessy Mutual Funds that have a sub advisor. With respect to the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF, our sub advisory agreement with VIA, one of the sub advisors for the fund, terminated automatically on July 14, 2023, in connection with an acquisition transaction that resulted in a change of control of VIA. As a result of the transaction, VIA ceased to exist and Vident Advisory became the sole Vident enterprise carrying out Vident s business and operations. On the same date, we entered into a new sub advisory agreement with Vident Advisory pursuant to which Vident Advisory now provides sub advisory services to the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. The new sub advisory agreement was approved by the Hennessy Funds Board of Trustees and by vote of the shareholders of the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. At the same meeting, the shareholders of the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF also approved the implementation of the manager of managers structure for the fund. 
 
 Shareholder Servicing Agreements and Fees 
 
 Pursuant to a shareholder servicing agreement with Hennessy Funds Trust, we provide shareholder services to investors in the Hennessy Mutual Funds including, among other things, maintaining a toll free number that the current investors in the Hennessy Funds may call to ask questions about their accounts or the funds and actively participating as a liaison between investors in the Hennessy Funds and U.S. Bank Global Fund Services. In exchange for these services, we receive a shareholder service fee from each Hennessy Mutual Fund of 0.10 of the average daily net assets of such fund s Investor Class shares. 
 
 The shareholder servicing agreement must be renewed annually by the Funds Board of Trustees, including the vote of a majority of the disinterested trustees. If the shareholder servicing agreement is not renewed, it terminates automatically. In addition, the shareholder servicing agreement may be terminated prior to its expiration upon 60 days written notice by Hennessy Funds Trust or us. 
 
 12b-1 Plans 
 
 All of the Hennessy Mutual Funds have adopted a 12b-1 plan. These plans are named after Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act, which permits a fund to adopt a plan that allows the fund to collect fees to use to make payments to third parties in connection with the distribution of fund shares. Amounts paid under a plan may be spent on any activities or expenses primarily intended to result in sale of shares of the fund, including, but not limited to (i) advertising, (ii) compensation paid to financial institutions, broker-dealers, and others for sales and marketing, (iii) shareholder accounting servicing, (iv) printing and mailing prospectuses to possible new investors, and (v) printing and mailing sales literature. A fund may also employ a distributor to distribute and market fund shares and then use 12b-1 fees to pay the distributor for expenses relating to telephone use, overhead, employing employees who engage in or support the distribution of the fund shares, printing prospectuses and other reports for possible new investors, advertising, and preparing and distributing sales literature. 
 
 The 12b 1 fee for each Hennessy Mutual Fund is 0.15 of the average daily net assets of such fund s Investor Class shares. 
 
 CUSTODIAL, DISTRIBUTION, AND BROKERAGE ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 We use independent third parties for custody and distribution of our assets under management. 

16

Table of Contents 

All trades for the Hennessy Funds are executed by independent brokerage firms following our direction or the direction of our sub advisors. When selecting brokers, we and our sub advisors are required to seek best execution. Although there is no single statutory definition, SEC releases and other legal guidelines make clear that this duty requires us to seek the most advantageous terms reasonably available under the circumstances for a customer s account. The lowest possible commission, while important, is not the sole determinative factor. We and our sub advisors also consider factors such as order size and market depth, availability of competing markets and liquidity, trading characteristics of the security, financial responsibility of the broker dealer, and the broker s ability to address current market conditions. 
 
 Currently, we participate in soft dollar arrangements with one of our brokers. This means we receive research reports and real-time electronic research to assist us in trading and managing the Hennessy Funds. Under these soft dollar arrangements, the Hennessy Funds pay brokerage commissions for securities trades at the regular market rate, and some or all of the value of those commissions is received by us in the form of research or other services that benefit the Hennessy Funds. We believe our soft dollar arrangements comply with SEC guidance regarding soft dollars. 
 
 LICENSE AGREEMENT 
 
 Our ability to use the names and formulaic investment strategies of the Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund and the Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund are governed by the terms and conditions of a license agreement, dated as of April 10, 2000, with Netfolio. Under the license agreement, Netfolio granted us a perpetual, paid-up, royalty free, exclusive license to use certain trademarks, such as Strategy Indexing, Cornerstone Growth, and Cornerstone Value, as well as the formula investment strategies used by the Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund and the Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund. All of our advertising, marketing, promotional, and other materials incorporating or referring to the trademarks are subject to the prior written approval of Netfolio, except that we do not need Netfolio s prior written approval to use the trademarks in a manner that is not substantially unchanged from any prior use by Netfolio in its own business or from any prior use by us previously approved by Netfolio. We have the right to assign the license to another person or entity if the assignee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of the license agreement. There are no ongoing licensing fees associated with this license agreement, and Netfolio does not have any contractual rights to terminate the license agreement. 
 
 BUSINESS STRATEGY 
 
 From the time we launched our first mutual fund in 1996, we have consistently pursued a growth strategy centered on organic growth through our marketing, sales, and distribution efforts and growth through strategic purchases of management related assets. The implementation of this business strategy is described below. 

Seeking to deliver strong investment performance of the Hennessy Funds 

One of the most effective ways we can grow the assets of the Hennessy Funds is by delivering strong investment performance, which we believe should: 

result in an increase in the value of existing assets of the Hennessy Funds; 

encourage more investors to buy shares of the Hennessy Funds and decrease the number of investors who redeem their shares and leave the Hennessy Funds; and 

motivate current investors to invest additional money in the Hennessy Funds. 

Utilizing our branding and marketing campaign to attract assets 

We believe we can attract investors to the Hennessy Funds by effectively marketing our consistent and disciplined approach to investing based on a buy and hold philosophy that rejects the idea of market timing. We offer quantitative funds, actively managed funds, and income-generating funds. We believe our quantitative funds attract investors who want to understand exactly how their investments are managed and who favor statistical analysis and empirical evidence as the basis for investment decisions. We also believe that our actively managed funds attract investors who appreciate a fundamental, hands-on investment management approach and talented portfolio managers. Finally, we believe our more conservative, income generating funds attract investors seeking alternatives to funds invested entirely in equities.

We run a comprehensive and far-reaching public relations program designed to disseminate our message to a wide variety of potential investors through frequent television appearances, radio spots, feature articles, and print media mentions. We have partnered with an industry-leading public relations firm, SunStar Strategic, to proactively promote the Hennessy Funds to national financial media. This public relations program has consistently resulted in the Hennessy Funds being mentioned an average of once every two to three days in national print and broadcast media such as CNBC, Fox News, Bloomberg radio and TV, The Wall Street Journal, Kiplinger, and Barron s, among others. To facilitate our presence in the media, we utilize LiveStudio, an in-house studio providing a direct link to media broadcasts, at our office in Novato, California. We have several spokespeople who help us expand our public relations program and provide comprehensive media coverage of our products, including (i) Neil J. Hennessy, who is our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors as well as President, Chief Market Strategist, and a Portfolio Manager of the Hennessy Funds, (ii) Ryan Kelley, Chief Investment Officer and a Portfolio Manager of the Hennessy Funds, and (iii) Portfolio Managers Ben Cook, David Ellison, and Josh Wein, as well as the Portfolio Managers at our sub advisors. 
 
 We maintain and regularly update a robust website and social media presence. Our core marketing efforts include targeted outreach to both current and prospective investors in the Hennessy Funds, including financial advisors and retail investors. Our content marketing includes overall market and sector specific thought leadership, promotional investment ideas, fund updates, and commentary from our portfolio managers, as well as feature news articles and broadcast appearances. We attend select investment advisor trade shows and strategic industry related conferences, and we seek opportunities to moderate or speak on industry-related panels. 

Expanding our distribution network to additional distribution platforms 

Investors may purchase shares of the Hennessy Funds through financial institutions, including fund supermarkets, national wirehouses and broker dealers, independent and regional broker-dealers, and registered investment advisors. 
 
 Fund supermarkets, such as Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, and Pershing, generally offer funds of many different investment companies to investors in exchange for a services fee paid by the applicable fund or that fund s investment advisor. The ability to purchase various funds in a single location is very attractive to investors, and the majority of our assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2023 was held at fund supermarkets. Additionally, we continually seek opportunities to form new relationships with financial institutions to make the Hennessy Funds even more accessible to investors. We oversee distribution of the Hennessy Funds through all financial institutions. 
 
 Investors may also purchase shares of the Hennessy Mutual Funds directly through the Hennessy Funds' website or by calling us or U.S. Bank Global Fund Services, the Hennessy Funds administrator. 

Increasing our current base of financial advisors and investment professionals 

Investment professionals generally have access to a wide variety of investment products they may recommend to their clients. A recommendation by an investment professional to a client to buy one of the Hennessy Funds may greatly influence that investor. Thus, we believe that expanding our current base of investment professionals who utilize no-load funds for their clients will help us increase our assets under management, which will in turn increase our revenues. 

Securing participation on the platforms of national full-service firms 

We continually strive to develop relationships with national full-service firms that permit their investment professionals to offer no-load funds to their clients as a way to increase the amount of assets that we manage, which will in turn increase our revenues.

Pursuing strategic purchases of management agreements for additional funds 

A primary component of our growth strategy is to selectively pursue strategic purchases of the assets related to the management of additional funds. We believe the regulatory burden imposed upon the fund industry, along with increased competition, has compressed the margins of smaller to mid-sized fund managers, making those managers more receptive to an asset purchase. The long term trend toward lower fees has made it more challenging to identify accretive asset purchases, but we believe that we are well positioned to move quickly once we identify any attractive purchase targets from the large supply of potential targets. 
 
 Through our asset purchase strategy, we have completed 11 purchases of the assets related to the management of investment funds over a 20 year period, integrating 4.3 billion in net assets of 31 different investment funds into the Hennessy Funds family. 

Delivering strong, high quality financial results. 

We seek to maintain a strong financial position and to manage our investment advisory business to meet the highest regulatory, ethical, and business standards and to maintain continuity of service to all of the investors in the Hennessy Funds. 
 
 COMPETITION 
 
 The investment advisory industry is highly competitive, with new competitors continually entering the industry. We compete directly with numerous global and U.S. investment managers, commercial banks, savings and loans associations, brokerage and investment banking firms, broker-dealers, insurance companies, and other financial institutions that often provide investment products with similar features and objectives to those we offer. These institutions range from small boutique firms to large financial services complexes. We are considered a small investment advisory company. Many competing companies are part of larger financial services companies that conduct business in more markets and have greater marketing, financial, technical, research, and distribution resources and other capabilities than we do. Most of the larger firms offer a broader range of financial services to the same retail and institutional investors we seek to serve. These factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage, and we can give no assurance that our strategies and efforts to maintain and enhance our current investor relationships, as well as to create new ones, will be successful. To grow our business, we must be able to compete effectively for assets under management. Key competitive factors include: 

the investment performance of the Hennessy Funds; 

the breadth of our product offerings; 

industry rankings of the Hennessy Funds; 

the quality of our services; 

our ability to further develop and market our brand; 

our commitment to placing the interests of investors first; and 

our general business reputation. 

Increased competition could reduce the demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Competition is an important risk that our business faces and should be considered along with other risk factors that we discuss in Item 1A, Risk Factors.

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 
 
 We are subject to an increasing number of extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations intended to protect investors in funds and investors of registered investment advisors. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations. 
 
 We are registered as an investment advisor with the SEC and, therefore, must comply with the requirements of the Advisers Act and related SEC regulations. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to investors, transactions with investors, compliance program effectiveness, solicitation arrangements, conflicts of interest, advertising, recordkeeping and reporting, disclosure, and anti-fraud matters. 
 
 We manage accounts for the Hennessy Funds on a discretionary basis, meaning that we have the authority to buy and sell securities for each portfolio, select broker dealers to execute trades, and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with certain of these transactions, we receive soft dollar credits from broker-dealers that have the effect of reducing certain of our expenses. All of our soft dollar arrangements are intended to be within the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). If our ability to use soft dollars were reduced or eliminated as a result of the implementation of statutory amendments or new regulations, our operating expenses would increase. 
 
 The Hennessy Funds are registered with the SEC under the 1940 Act, which imposes additional obligations on both the Hennessy Funds and us, as the advisor to the Hennessy Funds, including detailed operational requirements. While we exercise broad discretion over the day-to-day management of the business, affairs, and investment portfolios of the Hennessy Funds, our operations are subject to oversight and management by the Funds Board of Trustees. The responsibilities of the Funds Board of Trustees include, among other things, annually approving the continuation of our investment advisory agreements and shareholder servicing agreement with the Hennessy Funds and our sub-advisory agreements with the sub advisors to the Hennessy Funds, approving other service providers, determining the method of valuing assets, and monitoring transactions involving affiliates. The 1940 Act also imposes on us a fiduciary duty with respect to receiving investment advisory fees. That fiduciary duty may be enforced by the SEC, by administrative action, or through litigation initiated by investors in the Hennessy Funds pursuant to a private right of action. 
 
 The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act of 1940 and the 1940 Act, ranging from fines and censures to the suspension of individual employees to termination of our registration as an investment advisor. A violation of applicable law or regulations could also subject us, our directors, and our employees to civil actions brought by private parties. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable SEC requirements. 
 
 EMPLOYEES 
 
 As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had 17 employees, 16 of whom were full-time employees. Our 17 employees had an average tenure of 14 years as of the end of fiscal year 2023. We focus on providing our employees competitive compensation, a friendly and flexible office environment, and fostering close-knit working relationships among our team members. Over 50 of our employees are women, and with an executive team that is 50 women and 25 minority, we believe we have created an environment in which all team members can be successful and supported. 
 
 Our executive officers are (i) Neil J. Hennessy, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, (ii) Teresa M. Nilsen, President, Chief Operating Officer, Secretary, and a member of our Board of Directors, (iii) Kathryn R. Fahy, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, and (iv) Daniel B. Steadman, Executive Vice President. In addition to our executive officers responsibilities at Hennessy Advisors, Inc., (a) Mr. Hennessy is President, Chief Market Strategist, and a Portfolio Manager of the Hennessy Funds and is a member of the Funds Board of Trustees, (b) Ms. Nilsen is an Executive Vice President and Treasurer of the Hennessy Funds, (c) Ms. Fahy is Vice President, Assistant Treasurer, and Assistant Secretary of the Hennessy Funds, and (d) Mr. Steadman is an Executive Vice President and Secretary of the Hennessy Funds.

AVAILABLE INFORMATION 
 
 We make available free of charge through a link on our website, www.hennessyadvisors.com, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. We are not including the information contained on our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

We face many risks and uncertainties, many of which are inherent in the financial services industry and the investment advisory business. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, in evaluating us and our common stock. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks we face, including those described below. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT 
 
 Volatility in and disruption of the capital markets and changes in the economy has and may continue to significantly affect our assets under management and revenues. 
 
 The securities markets are inherently volatile and may be affected by factors beyond our control, including global economic conditions, industry trends, interest and inflation rate fluctuations, political factors, the imposition of economic sanctions, public health crises, natural disasters, and other factors that are difficult to predict. Because our assets under management is largely concentrated in equity products, our results are particularly susceptible to downturns in the equity markets. We derive all of our operating revenues from investment advisory fees and shareholder service fees paid to us by the Hennessy Funds. These fees are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset value of the Hennessy Funds. Accordingly, our revenues increase or decrease as our average assets under management increases or decreases, which is affected by market appreciation or depreciation and purchases and redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds. Changing market conditions could also cause an impairment to the value of our management contract asset. 
 
 Investors in the Hennessy Funds can redeem their investments at any time and for any reason, including poor investment performance and volatile equity markets. A decline in our assets under management adversely affects our revenues. 
 
 Investors in the Hennessy Funds may redeem their investments at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Success in the investment advisory and fund business is largely dependent on investment performance, as well as investor servicing and distribution. If the Hennessy Funds perform poorly compared to the investment products offered by other investment advisory firms, we may experience a decrease in purchases of shares and an increase in redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds. Further, sharp declines in the stock market have and may continue to cause increases in redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds. Such redemptions reduce our assets under management and adversely affect our revenues. 
 
 Adverse opinions of the Hennessy Funds by third parties, including rating agencies or industry analysts, could decrease new investments in, or accelerate redemptions from, the Hennessy Funds, which would adversely affect our revenues. 
 
 The Hennessy Funds are rated, ranked, and assessed by independent third parties, including rating agencies, industry analysts, distribution partners, and industry periodicals. These ratings, rankings, and assessments often influence the investment decisions of investors, but they can be affected by a number of factors that are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a ranking agency like Morningstar may change its ranking designs and methodology, which could result in a decrease in the ratings of the Hennessy Funds without any action on our part. If the Hennessy Funds received an adverse rating, ranking, or assessment from a third party, it could result in an increase in the withdrawal of assets from the Hennessy Funds by existing investors and the inability to attract additional investments into the Hennessy Funds from existing and new investors, thereby reducing our assets under management and adversely affecting our revenues.

Table of Contents 

The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may have a negative impact on the Hennessy Funds within such similar product type, irrespective of our fund performance. 
 
 Many competitors offer similar products to the Hennessy Funds, and the failure or negative performance of competitors products could lead to a loss of confidence in the corresponding products in the Hennessy Funds lineup, irrespective of the performance of the Hennessy Funds. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to redemptions in the Hennessy Fund within such product type, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Our business and operations are subject to adverse effects from market reactions to the outbreak of contagious diseases. 
 
 The outbreak and spread of contagious diseases such as COVID-19 has adversely impacted global commercial activity, contributed to significant volatility in global equity and debt markets, and disrupted supply chains, operations, and economic activity. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted the value and performance of the Hennessy Funds, which resulted in declines in our revenues. It also limited our ability to source and pursue potential acquisitions. Future outbreaks of contagious diseases could have similar adverse impacts on our business and financial performance. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND OPERATIONS 
 
 We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of the Hennessy Funds. 
 
 For the past several years, approximately 75 of our assets under management has been concentrated in five of our funds. During fiscal year 2023, our average assets under management was concentrated in the following five funds: (i) the Hennessy Focus Fund (23 of average assets under management); (ii) the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (17 of average assets under management); (iii) the Hennessy Cornerstone Midcap 30 Fund (15 of average assets under management); (iv) the Hennessy Japan Fund (10 of average assets under management); and (v) the Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund (10 of average assets under management). Consequently, our revenues followed a similar pattern of concentration: (a) the Hennessy Focus Fund (27 of total revenue); (b) the Hennessy Cornerstone Midcap 30 Fund (15 of total revenue); (c) the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (10 of total revenue); (d) the Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund (10 of total revenue); and (e) the Hennessy Japan Fund (10 of total revenue). As a result, our operating results are particularly dependent upon the performance of a very small number funds and our ability to maintain and grow assets under management in these funds. These funds have experienced significant redemptions in recent years and may continue to do so for the future. This has reduced, and may continue to reduce, our assets under management and revenues. 
 
 We utilize unaffiliated sub advisors to manage the portfolio composition of certain of the Hennessy Funds, and any matters that have an adverse impact on their businesses or any change in our relationships with our sub advisors could lead to a reduction in assets under management, which would adversely affect our revenues. 
 
 We utilize unaffiliated sub advisors to manage the portfolio composition of some of the Hennessy Funds. Although we perform due diligence on our sub advisors, we do not manage their day to day business activities. Our financial condition and profitability may be adversely affected by situations that are specific to such sub advisors, such as disruption of their operations, their exposure to disciplinary action, or reputational harm to them. 
 
 We periodically negotiate the terms and conditions of these sub advisory relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or our sub advisors. These relationships may also be terminated by us or the applicable sub advisor without penalty on 60 days notice. In addition, each sub advisory agreement must be renewed annually by the Funds Board of Trustees (or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable Hennessy Fund), including a majority of the disinterested trustees. Furthermore, a sub advisory agreement automatically terminates if it is assigned. Assignment is generally defined under the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act to include direct assignments as well as assignments that are deemed to occur due to the change in control of the investment advisor, which includes us or one of the sub advisors that we have engaged on behalf of certain of the Hennessy Funds. However, a transaction is not an assignment under the 1940 Act or the Advisers Act if it does not result in a change of actual control or management of us or, in the context of a sub-advisor, a change of actual control or management of the sub-advisor.

Table of Contents 

Generally, if a sub advisor experiences a change of control but we do not, we could continue acting as an advisor to the applicable Hennessy Fund, but the shareholders of such Hennessy Fund would have to approve a new sub advisory agreement for the sub advisor. However, for the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF, we have the authority to appoint and replace unaffiliated sub advisors and to enter into and make material amendments to the related sub advisory agreements without shareholder approval. This is because we recently sought and received an exemptive order from the SEC to operate under a manager of managers structure and subsequently obtained shareholder approval to implement such structure for the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. Under the manager of managers structure, we have ultimate responsibility, subject to oversight of and approval by the Hennessy Funds Board of Trustees, for overseeing the Hennessy Funds unaffiliated sub-advisors and recommending their hiring, termination, or replacement. We have not yet received, and do not have an estimated timeline for receiving, shareholder approval to operate under a manager of managers structure for the Hennessy Mutual Funds that are sub advised. 
 
 Any interruption or termination of our sub advisory relationships, whether due to a change of control or any other circumstance, could affect our ability to market our sub advised funds and result in a reduction in assets under management, which would adversely affect our revenues. 
 
 We utilize a unitary fee structure for the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF, and we bear the risk that the Fund s operating expenses may increase and lead to a reduction in our revenues from the fund. 
 
 The Hennessy Stance ESG ETF pays us a unitary fee under its investment advisory agreement with us. Under a unitary fee structure, we bear all operating expenses incurred in connection with providing services to the fund. The operating expenses covered by the unitary fee include third party data providers, transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. Additionally, for no compensation, we pay all other operating expenses of the fund, including sub-advisory fees, with the exception of the following: (1) the management fees paid to us; (2) distribution fees and expenses paid by the fund under any distribution plan adopted pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act; (3) interest expenses; (4) brokerage expenses, trading expenses, and other expenses (such as stamp taxes) in connection with the execution of portfolio transactions or in connection with creation or redemption transactions; (5) compensation paid to the independent trustees of the fund and fees paid to independent trustees counsel; (6) tax expenses and governmental fees; and (7) extraordinary expenses not incurred in the course of ordinary business (the Excluded Fees ). The fund and its shareholders bear the costs of Excluded Fees. The unitary fee structure generally eliminates the possibility for any decrease in the total fund expense ratio during periods when assets under management increased, which could lead to increased profitability for us if ware able to achieve economies of scale. On the other hand, if the fund s operating expenses increase (other than Excluded Fees), this will lead to a reduction in our revenues from the fund. 
 
 We depend on key personnel to manage our business, and the loss of any key person s services, combined with our inability to identify and retain a suitable replacement for such person, could materially adversely affect us. Additionally, the cost to retain our key personnel could put pressure on our operating margins. 
 
 Our success is largely dependent on the skills, experience, and performance of our key personnel. The business acumen, investment advisory expertise, and business relationships of our key personnel are critical elements in operating and expanding our business. Financial services professionals are in high demand, and we face significant competition for qualified employees. The loss of services of any of our key personnel for any reason, combined with our inability to identify and retain a suitable replacement for such person, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, in order to retain key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation to such individuals, resulting in additional expense. 
 
 We have debt and may incur additional debt, which may increase the risk of investing in us and may harm our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and therefore increase the risks associated with investing in our securities.

On October 20, 2021, we completed a public offering of the 2026 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of 40.25 million, which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after December 31, 2023. The 2026 Notes bear interest at 4.875 per annum, payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and at maturity, beginning December 31, 2021. The 2026 Notes are direct unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with any of our future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides that it is subordinate to the 2026 Notes, effectively subordinate to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any future subsidiaries of ours. 
 
 We may incur additional debt in the future. Our indebtedness could (i) decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes, (ii) limit our flexibility to make acquisitions, (iii) increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest, (iv) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry, and (v) increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions and financial, business, and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. 
 
 Changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our net revenues and hinder our growth. 
 
 Our primary source of distribution of the Hennessy Funds is through a variety of financial institutions. Our success is highly dependent on access to these various distribution channels. We cannot guarantee we will be able to retain access to these channels at similar pricing or at all. Increasing competition for these distribution channels could cause our distribution costs to rise, which could have a material adverse effect on our net income. These financial institutions generally can terminate their relationships with us on short notice. Mergers and other corporate transactions among distributors also may affect our relationships with financial institutions. Certain of the financial institutions upon whom we rely to distribute the Hennessy Funds also sell their own competing proprietary investment products, which could limit the distribution of our products. Investors increasingly rely on external consultants and other third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager. These consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence over their clients choices, and they may favor one of our competitors as better meeting their particular clients needs. There is no assurance that the Hennessy Funds will be among their recommended choices in the future. 
 
 Additionally, particularly in the United States, certain financial institutions have substantially reduced the number of investment funds they make available to their clients. If a material portion of the financial institutions with whom we do business were to substantially narrow their product offerings, it could have a significant adverse effect on our assets under management, revenues, and net income. More broadly, in both retail and institutional channels, financial institutions (distribution firms and consultants) are seeking to reduce the number of investment management firms with which they do business. This poses risks of additional lost business if a particular financial institution chooses to stop or significantly reduce its business relationship with us. Any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these financial institutions and the consultant community due to any of the above-described factors would impair our ability to distribute the Hennessy Funds, which in turn would have a negative effect on our assets under management, revenues, and net income. 
 
 Management contracts purchased by us are currently classified as an indefinite life asset subject to impairment analysis. The impairment analysis is based on subjective criteria, and an impairment loss could be recorded. 
 
 The management contracts we have purchased, an 81.3 million asset on the balance sheet as of the end of fiscal year 2023, are considered an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. Management reviews the indefinite life classification of our management contract asset each reporting period. If the management contract asset is ever reclassified as an asset with a definite life, we would begin amortizing the management contracts over their remaining useful life. If the management contract asset continues to be classified as an indefinite life asset, we will continue to periodically review the carrying value to determine if any impairment has occurred. The impairment analysis is based on anticipated future cash flows, which are calculated based on assets under management. Although the management contract asset is not currently impaired, there is always a possibility of impairment in the future, which could require us to write off all or a portion of the asset. A write-off, depending on the amount, could have operational risks and could have a significant impact on the value of our equity and our earnings per share.

We may be required to forego all or a portion of our fees under our investment advisory agreements with the Hennessy Funds. 
 
 On an annual basis, the Funds Board of Trustees must assess the reasonableness of our investment advisory fees. While the Funds Board of Trustees has found our investment advisory fees to be reasonable in the past, we cannot guarantee that it will continue to do so. Additionally, we regularly analyze the expense ratios of the Hennessy Funds and have the right to waive fees to compete with other funds with lower expense ratios (although in the past we have only waived fees based on contractual obligations). Any waiver of or reduction in fees would cause our revenues to decline and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any fee waiver would apply only on a going forward basis. 
 
 The Hennessy Japan Fund and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund invest in the Japanese stock market in yen, which involves foreign exchange and economic uncertainties. 
 
 The Hennessy Japan Fund and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund are invested in securities listed on the Japanese stock market, which exposes these funds to risks that are not typically associated with an investment in a U.S. issuer. The values of these funds fluctuate with changes in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Investments in Japanese securities also expose these funds to the economic uncertainties affecting Japan, which may differ from those affecting the United States. Further, Japanese financial accounting standards and practices may differ, and there may be less information on Japanese companies available publicly. If these circumstances result in a reduction in the total assets of the Hennessy Japan Fund and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund, our assets under management would be reduced, which would adversely affect our revenues. 
 
 We utilize quantitative investment strategies for some of the Hennessy Funds that require us to invest in specific portfolios of securities and hold these positions for a specified period of time regardless of performance. 
 
 Our formula driven funds adhere to quantitative investment strategies, and the portfolios of stocks held by such funds are rescreened and rebalanced at designated times in accordance with such investment strategies. Adhering to our investment strategies regardless of any adverse developments that may arise could result in substantial losses to the formula driven Hennessy Funds if, for example, the stocks selected for a fund are experiencing financial difficulty or are out of favor with investors in a given period. This could, in theory, result in relatively low performance of the formula driven Hennessy Funds and adversely affect the net assets of such Hennessy Funds. A decrease in the net assets of the Hennessy Funds would adversely affect our revenues. 
 
 We pursue strategic asset purchases as part of our regular business strategy, and such acquisitions involve inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition and potentially dilute the holdings of current shareholders. 
 
 As part of our regular business strategy, we pursue strategic purchases of the assets related to the management of additional funds. This strategy is accompanied by risks including, among others, the possibility of the following: 

the potential unavailability of attractive acquisition opportunities; 

a high level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources than we do; 

our inability to value potential asset purchases accurately and negotiate acceptable purchase terms; 

our inability to obtain quorum and secure enough affirmative votes to gain approval of the proposed fund reorganization from the target fund s investors; 

the loss of fund assets paid for in an asset purchase through redemptions by investors of the funds involved in the asset purchase; 

higher than anticipated asset purchase expenses; 

25

Table of Contents 

our inability to successfully integrate and maintain adequate infrastructure to support business growth; 

increasing our leverage; 

the potential diversion of our management s time and attention; 

dilution to our shareholders if we fund an asset purchase in whole or in part with our common stock; and 

adverse effects on our earnings if purchased intangible assets become impaired. 

While we seek to mitigate these risks through, among other things, due diligence and indemnification provisions, these or other risk-mitigating measures that we put in place may not be sufficient to address these risks. If one or more of these risks occur, we may be unable to successfully complete a purchase of management related assets (thereby requiring us to write off any related expenses), we may experience an impairment of our management contract asset, we may receive negative publicity or suffer other negative impacts on our reputation, and we may not achieve the expected return on investment. Any of these results could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Our investment advisory and shareholder servicing agreements can be terminated on short notice, are not freely assignable, and must be renewed annually; the loss of such agreements would reduce our revenues. 
 
 We generate all of our operating revenues from the investment advisory and shareholder servicing agreements with the Hennessy Funds. These agreements may be terminated without penalty on 60 days notice and may not be assigned without the consent of investors in the Hennessy Funds. In addition, they each must be renewed annually by the Funds Board of Trustees (or, in the case of our investment advisory agreements, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable Hennessy Fund), including a majority of the disinterested trustees. The termination or non-renewal of these agreements, or the renegotiation of the terms of these agreements in a manner detrimental to us, could result in a substantial reduction in revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO OUR INDUSTRY 
 
 Investor behavior is influenced by short-term investment performance. 
 
 Investor behavior may be based on many factors, including short-term investment performance. Poor short term performance of the Hennessy Funds, irrespective of longer term success, could potentially lead to a decrease in purchases of shares of the Hennessy Funds and an increase in redemptions, thereby reducing our assets under management and adversely affecting our revenues. 
 
 Assets invested through financial institutions can be quickly redeemed, which could reduce our revenues. 
 
 Financial institutions are attractive to investors because of the ease of accessibility to a variety of funds, but this may cause the investments to be more sensitive to fluctuations in performance, especially in the short term. If we were unable to retain the assets of the Hennessy Funds held through financial institutions, our assets under management would be reduced. As a result, our revenues could decline and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Table of Contents 

We face intense competition in attracting investors and retaining net assets in the Hennessy Funds. 
 
 The investment advisory industry is intensely competitive and new participants are continually entering the industry. We compete directly with numerous global and U.S. investment advisors, commercial banks, savings and loan associations, brokerage and investment banking firms, broker-dealers, insurance companies, and other financial institutions that often provide investment products with similar features and objectives to those we offer. These institutions range from small boutique firms to large financial services complexes. We are considered a small investment advisory company. Many competing companies are part of larger financial services companies that conduct business in more markets and have greater marketing, financial, technical, research, and distribution resources and other capabilities than we do. Most of the larger firms offer a broader range of financial services to the same retail and institutional investors that we seek to serve. If we are unable to attract investors and retain net assets in the Hennessy Funds due to increased competition, our revenues could decline and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 For more information regarding competitive factors, see the Competition subheading in Item 1, Business. 
 
 We may be unable to develop or acquire new products and the development of new products may expose us to reputational harm, additional costs, or operational risk. 
 
 Our continued financial performance may depend on our ability to react to changes in the asset management industry, respond to evolving investor demands and develop, market, and manage new investment products. Conversely, the development and introduction of new products, including the creation or acquisition of products with a focus on ESG matters, requires continued innovative effort on our part and may require significant time and resources, as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting investor and market preferences, the introduction of competing products, constraints on our ability to manage growth, and compliance with regulatory and disclosure requirements. A growing number of new products also depend on data provided by third parties as analytical inputs and are subject to additional risks, including with respect to data quality, cost, availability, and provider relationships. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or acquire new products that address the needs of investors on the timescale they require. Any failure to successfully develop or acquire new products, or effectively manage associated operational risks, could harm our reputation and expose us to additional costs, which may reduce our assets under management and adversely affect our revenues. 
 
 Market consolidation and industry trends could negatively impact our business. 
 
 In recent years, there have been several instances of industry consolidation in both the distribution and investment management areas. Further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future. The increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future. Additionally, the market environment has increasingly led some investors to favor lower fee, passive products. As a result, investment advisors that emphasize passive products have gained, and may continue to gain, market share from active managers like us. 
 
 Industry trends and market pressure to lower our investment advisory fees could reduce our profit margin. 
 
 Our profits are highly dependent on the fees we are able to charge to the Hennessy Funds for investment advisory services. To the extent we are forced to compete on the basis of the investment advisory fees we charge to the Hennessy Funds, we may not be able to maintain our current fee structures. We have historically competed primarily on the performance of the Hennessy Funds and not on the level of our investment advisory fees relative to those of our competitors. In recent years, however, there has been a trend toward lower fees in the investment advisory industry. To maintain our fee structures in a competitive environment, we must be able to provide investors in the Hennessy Funds with investment returns and service that will adequately compensate them for investing in our funds with our current fee structures. We may not succeed in maintaining our current fee structures, and fee reductions on existing or future business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 Higher insurance premiums and increased insurance coverage risks could increase our costs and reduce our profitability. 
 
 We carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate, but we cannot guarantee that our insurance policies will cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed or, if covered, that such liabilities and losses will not exceed insurance coverage limits or that our insurers will remain solvent and meet their obligations. In addition, insurance premiums and required retentions have increased in the past and may do so again in the future.

Table of Contents 

We are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation. An adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties. Various claims may also arise against us in the ordinary course of business, such as employment-related claims. There has been increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years, including customer claims and class action suits alleging substantial monetary damages. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or co-insurance liabilities, or pay higher premiums, which would increase our expenses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 We depend on information technology, and any failures of or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber attacks, could result in significant limits on our ability to conduct our operations and activities, costs, and reputational damage. 
 
 We use software and related technologies throughout our business and also utilize third-party vendors who use software and related technologies to provide services to us and the Hennessy Funds. We are dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cybersecurity policies, procedures, and capabilities we maintain to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them, including data provided by third parties that is significant to our business. An information security incident, such as a cyber-attack involving a phishing scam, business email compromise, malware, or ransomware attack, or an internally caused incident or disruption, such as misuse or a failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt our business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential investor or competitive information. Moreover, our growing reliance on mobile and cloud technology and any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption, or loss of personal, confidential, or proprietary information or third-party data. Additionally, although we take precautions to password protect and encrypt our laptops and other mobile electronic hardware, if such hardware is stolen, misplaced, or left unattended, it may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security risk and resulting in potentially costly actions. Furthermore, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available. 
 
 The financial services industry has been the subject of cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft, and destruction of corporate information or other assets as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by terrorist organizations and nation state actors. Although we have implemented policies and controls to prevent and address potential data breaches, inadvertent disclosures, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks, and cyber-related fraud, there can be no assurance that any of these measures will prove effective. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, to implement adequate preventative measures, or to address them until they are discovered. In addition, a successful cyber-attack may persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and it may take a considerable amount of time for an investigation to be completed and the severity and potential impact to be known. While such an investigation is ongoing, we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, and communication to the public, regulators, shareholders, and investors in the Hennessy Funds may be inaccurate, any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of an information security incident. 
 
 If any of these events were to occur, we could suffer a financial loss, a disruption of our business, liability to the Hennessy Funds and their investors, regulatory intervention, or reputational damage, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We also may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. In addition, our cybersecurity insurance may not cover all losses and damages from such events and our ability to maintain or obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future may be limited. 
 
 Finally, cybersecurity and data privacy have become high priorities for regulators, and many jurisdictions are enacting laws and regulations in these areas. Enactment of privacy laws or regulations could, among other things, result in additional costs of compliance or litigation. In addition, while we strive to comply with the relevant laws and regulations, any failure to comply could result in regulatory investigations and penalties as well as negative publicity, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We are exposed to legal risk and litigation, which could increase our expenses and reduce our profitability. 
 
 We are subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability, including, by way of example, investors in the Hennessy Funds, our own shareholders, our employees, or regulators. Lawsuits or investigations that we may become involved in could be very expensive and highly damaging to our reputation, even if the underlying claims are without merit. 
 
 Our business is extensively regulated, which increases our costs of doing business, and our failure to comply with regulatory requirements may harm our financial condition. 
 
 Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States, particularly by the SEC. We are subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, and various other statutes. The laws to which we are subject are designed primarily to protect investors in the Hennessy Funds as opposed to our shareholders. In addition to an increased number of applicable laws, the investment fund industry has undergone increased scrutiny by the SEC and state regulators in recent years, resulting in numerous enforcement actions and sweep examinations. Increased regulation has increased our costs in managing the Hennessy Funds, and we could continue to experience higher costs if new laws require us to spend more time, hire additional personnel, or buy new technology to comply effectively. Any change in law could also have a material adverse effect on us by limiting the sources of our revenues and increasing our costs. In addition to securities regulations, our business also may be materially adversely affected by other types of laws and policies. 
 
 Any determination of a failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, or regulations could expose us or our employees to civil liability, criminal liability, or disciplinary or enforcement action, with penalties that could include the disgorgement of fees, fines, sanctions, suspensions, or censure of individual employees, or revocation or limitation of business activities or registration, and may result in monetary losses that are not covered by insurance in adequate amounts or at all, any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, if we or our employees were to fail to comply with applicable laws, rules, or regulations, or be named as a subject of an investigation or other regulatory action, the public announcement and potential publicity surrounding any such investigation or action could have an adverse effect on our reputation and our stock price and result in increased costs, even if we or our employees were found not to have violated such laws, rules, or regulations. 
 
 Changes to U.S. or state tax laws, our failure to adequately comply with U.S. or state tax laws, or the outcome of any audits or regulatory disputes with respect to our compliance with U.S. or state tax laws could adversely affect us. 
 
 Changes to U.S. or state tax law could be enacted in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, we are subject to potential tax audits in various jurisdictions and in such event, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess penalties or additional taxes. While we assess regularly the likely outcomes of these potential audits, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of a potential audit, and an audit could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Our investment advisory agreements require us to adhere to the investment policies and strategies of the Hennessy Funds; any failure to comply with such requirements could result in claims, losses, or regulatory sanctions. 
 
 Our investment advisory agreements with the Hennessy Funds contain contractual provisions that require us to comply with the investment policies and strategies of the Hennessy Funds when we provide our investment advisory services. We are also required to comply with numerous investment, asset valuation, distribution, and tax requirements under applicable law and regulations. Any allegation of a failure to adhere to these requirements could result in investor claims, reputational damage, withdrawal of assets, and potential regulatory sanctions, any of which could negatively impact our revenues and earnings. We have implemented procedures and utilize the services of experienced administrators, accountants, and lawyers to assist in satisfying these requirements, but there can be no assurance that these precautions will protect us from potential liabilities.

We may need to raise additional capital to fund new business initiatives, and resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, which could have an adverse impact on our business. 
 
 Our ability to meet our future cash needs is dependent upon our ability to generate cash. Although we have been successful in generating sufficient cash in the past, we may not be successful in the future. We may need to raise additional capital to fund new business initiatives or repay the 2026 Notes, and financing may not be available to us in sufficient amounts, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our ability to access bank financing or capital markets efficiently depends on a number of factors, including the state of credit and equity markets, interest rates, and credit spreads. If we are unable to access sufficient capital on acceptable terms, our business could be adversely impacted. 
 
 Failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies, as well as circumvention of established controls and policies by employees, could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors in the Hennessy Funds and by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational harm. 
 
 Our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining investors in the Hennessy Funds. In recent years, there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud, conflicts of interest, or other misconduct by individuals in the financial services industry. We have implemented controls and risk management policies to monitor and manage risks, but we cannot be certain that such controls and policies will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks. Further, although we strive to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and emphasize the importance of doing so to our employees, there is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage in, or be accused of engaging in, illegal or suspicious activity (such as improper trading, disclosure of confidential information, or breach of fiduciary duties), we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position, and ability to maintain and grow the number of investors in the Hennessy Funds. 
 
 The historical performance of the Hennessy Funds should not be considered indicative of the future results of the Hennessy Funds or of any returns expected on our common stock. 
 
 The historical performance of the Hennessy Funds is relevant to returns on our common stock only insofar as the fees we have earned in the past and may earn in the future, which are based on average assets under management, may impact the performance of our common stock. Positive performance of the Hennessy Funds typically increases our revenues, which in turn could positively affect our business, and poor performance typically reduces our revenues, which in turn could adversely affect our business. However, the historical and potential future returns of the Hennessy Funds are not directly linked to returns on our common stock, such that positive performance of the Hennessy Funds will not necessarily result in positive returns on our common stock and poor performance of the Hennessy Funds will not necessary result in negative returns on our common stock. Moreover, the historical performance of the Hennessy Funds should not be considered indicative of the future results that should be expected from such funds. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK 
 
 Ownership of a large percentage of our common stock is concentrated with a small number of shareholders, which could increase the volatility in our stock trading and significantly affect our share price and causes us to experience limited trading volume in our securities. 
 
 We have a limited number of shareholders, and a large percentage of our common stock is held by an even fewer number of shareholders. If our larger shareholders were to decide to liquidate their ownership positions, it could cause significant fluctuations in the share price of our common stock. Having a limited number of shareholders also causes us to experience limited trading volume in our securities.

In August 2022, the Board of Directors increased the number of shares that may be repurchased under the stock buyback program by 500,000 shares, to a total of 2,000,000 shares. We did not repurchase any shares pursuant to the stock buyback program during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 The shares that we repurchased in August and September 2023 are not subject to a maximum per plan or program because we did not repurchase them pursuant to a plan or program.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws, for which we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as expect, anticipate, intend, may, plan, will, should, could, would, assume, believe, estimate, predict, potential, project, continue, seek, and similar expressions, as well as statements in the future tense. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events, based on information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at which, or means by which, such performance or results will be achieved. 
 
 Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Unforeseen developments could cause actual performance or results to differ substantially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward looking statements. Management does not assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of these forward looking statements. There is no regulation requiring an update of any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations. 
 
 Our business activities are affected by many factors, including, without limitation, redemptions by investors in the Hennessy Funds, taxes, general economic and business conditions, interest rate movements, inflation, the personal savings rate, competitive conditions, industry regulation, and fluctuations in the stock market, many of which are beyond the control of our management. Further, the business and regulatory environments in which we operate remain complex, uncertain, and subject to change. We expect that regulatory requirements and developments will cause us to incur additional administrative and compliance costs. Notwithstanding the variability in our economic and regulatory environments, we remain focused on the investment performance of the Hennessy Funds and on providing high quality customer service to investors. 
 
 Our business strategy centers on (i) the identification, completion, and integration of future acquisitions and (ii) organic growth, through both the retention of the fund assets we currently manage and the generation of inflows into the funds we manage. The success of our business strategy may be influenced by the factors discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors. All statements regarding our business strategy, as well as statements regarding market trends and risks and assumptions about changes in the marketplace, are forward looking by their nature.

OVERVIEW 
 
 Our primary business activity is providing investment advisory services to a family of 16 open-end mutual funds and one ETF branded as the Hennessy Funds. We manage 12 of the 17 Hennessy Funds internally. For the remaining five funds, we have delegated the day to day portfolio management responsibilities to sub advisors, subject to our oversight. We oversee the selection and continued employment of each sub advisor, review each fund s investment performance, and monitor each sub advisor s adherence to each applicable fund s investment objectives, policies, and restrictions. In addition, we conduct ongoing reviews of the compliance programs of sub advisors and make onsite visits to sub advisors, as feasible. Our secondary business activity is providing shareholder services to investors in the Hennessy Mutual Funds. 
 
 We derive our operating revenues from investment advisory fees paid to us by the Hennessy Funds and shareholder service fees paid to us by the Hennessy Mutual Funds. These fees are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net assets of each Hennessy Fund. The percentage amount of the investment advisory fees varies by fund. The percentage amount of the shareholder service fees is consistent across all Hennessy Mutual Funds, but shareholder service fees are charged on Investor Class shares only. The dollar amount of the fees we receive fluctuates with changes in the average net asset value of each Hennessy Fund, which is affected by each fund s investment performance, purchases and redemptions of shares, general market conditions, and the success of our marketing, sales, and public relations efforts. 
 
 U.S. equities had strong, positive performance for the one year period ended September 30, 2023, with the S P 500 Index returning 21.62 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average returning 19.18 for the period (on a total return basis). Equity prices advanced despite a rise in interest rates as it appears investors now expect that the Federal Reserve is likely to be near the end of raising the Federal Funds rate. The United States economy continues to create jobs with the unemployment rate now standing at 3.8 while inflation continues to moderate. The steady drop in inflation from levels one year ago, within the backdrop of a strong labor market, has helped to propel the stock market higher. The Consumer Price Index advanced 8.0 in 2022 and is expected to rise 4.1 in 2023, according to Bloomberg. While this current level is still above the Federal Reserve s 2 target for inflation, the market seems to be pricing in the Federal Reserve standing on the sidelines for the foreseeable future. According to Bloomberg, the market is not expecting any reasonable chance of any Fed action until next July, when the market is pricing in a better than even chance of a rate cut. 
 
 Long-term U.S. bonds increased meaningfully during the one year period ended September 30, 2023, as the Federal Reserve continued raising the Federal Funds rate. With a yield curve that remains inverted, investor attention has focused on economic growth that continues to defy consensus expectations. While real GDP increased 1.9 in 2022, it is expected to accelerate slightly in 2023 with consensus growth expectation of 2.1 , according to Bloomberg. The idea that the economy was inevitably headed toward a recession has been reconsidered and the market seems to now believe that the economy, while perhaps slowing, is not likely to go into a recession. For the one year period ended September 30, 2023, 10-year U.S. Government Bond yields rose from 3.83 to 4.57 . 
 
 The Japanese equity market increased 25.56 (in U.S. dollar terms) for the one year period ended September 30, 2023, as measured by the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX). Like many other markets, Japan s stock market has rebounded sharply from its weakness in the prior twelve-month period. A relatively strong earnings backdrop in Japan has been supported by the weakening of the yen and strong domestic demand. The market is now focusing its attention on the idea that the Bank of Japan could announce an end to negative interest rates by the end of the year. 
 
 Against this positive equity performance backdrop, 14 of the 17 Hennessy Funds posted positive returns for the one year period ended September 30, 2023. The longer term performance numbers remain strong, with 13 of the Hennessy Funds posting positive returns for the three-year and five year periods ended September 30, 2023, and all 14 Hennessy Funds with at least 10 years of operating history posting positive returns for the 10 year period ended September 30, 2023.

As always, we are committed to providing superior service to investors and employing a consistent and disciplined approach to investing based on a buy and hold philosophy that rejects the idea of market timing. Our goal is to provide products that investors can have confidence in, knowing their money is invested as promised and with their best interests in mind. Accordingly, we continually seek new and improved ways to support investors in the Hennessy Funds, including by providing market insights, sector highlights, and other resources to help them manage their fund investments with confidence. We operate a robust and leading edge marketing automation and customer relationship management (CRM) system, with a database of over 100,000 financial advisors in addition to retail investors. We utilize this technology both to help retain assets and drive new purchases into the Hennessy Funds. We employ a comprehensive marketing and sales program consisting of content, digital, social media, and traditional marketing initiatives and proactive meetings. In addition, our consistent annual public relations campaign has resulted in the Hennessy brand name appearing on TV, radio, print, or online media on average once every two to three days. 
 
 We provide service to over 149,000 fund accounts nationwide, including accounts held by investors who employ financial advisors to assist them with investing as well as accounts held by retail investors who invest directly with us. We serve approximately 11,600 financial advisors who utilize the Hennessy Funds on behalf of their clients, including nearly 800 who purchased one of our Funds for the first time during fiscal year 2023. Approximately 14 of such advisors own two or more Hennessy Funds, and over 400 advisors hold a position of over 500,000. While numbers have declined in recent years, we continue to focus significant efforts on financial advisors who own two or more Hennessy Funds or hold a position of over 500,000 in an effort to build and maintain brand loyalty among our top tier of advisors. 
 
 Total assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2023 was 3.0 billion, an increase of 0.1 billion, or 4.7 , compared to the end of fiscal year 2022. The increase in total assets was attributable to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of the Hennessy Funds.

The principal asset on our balance sheet, management contract asset, represents the capitalized costs incurred in connection with the purchase of the assets related to the management of investment funds. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, this asset had a net balance of 81.3 million, an increase of 0.4 million since the end of fiscal year 2022. The increase is related to the purchase of assets related to the management of an ETF that were reorganized into the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF and the costs associated with the definitive agreement signed with CCM in April 2023.

On October 20, 2021, we completed a public offering of the 2026 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of 40.25 million, which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after December 31, 2023. The 2026 Notes bear interest at 4.875 per annum, payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and at maturity, beginning December 31, 2021. The 2026 Notes are direct unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with any of our future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides that it is subordinate to the 2026 Notes, effectively subordinate to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any future subsidiaries of ours. The 2026 Notes are the principal liability on our balance sheet at 39.2 million, net of issuance costs.

Revenue Investment Advisory Fees and Shareholder Service Fees 

Total revenue comprises investment advisory fees and shareholder service fees. Comparing fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2022, total revenue decreased by 19.0 , from 29.7 million to 24.0 million, investment advisory fees decreased by 19.6 , from 27.5 million to 22.1 million, and shareholder service fees decreased by 12.2 , from 2.2 million to 1.9 million. 
 
 The decrease in investment advisory fees was due mainly to decreased average daily net assets of the Hennessy Funds. The decrease in shareholder service fees was due to a decrease in the average daily net assets held in Investor Class shares of the Hennessy Mutual Funds. Assets held in Investor Class shares of the Hennessy Mutual Funds are subject to a shareholder service fee, whereas assets held in Institutional Class shares of the Hennessy Mutual Funds are not subject to a shareholder service fee. 
 
 We collect investment advisory fees from each Hennessy Fund at differing annual rates. These annual rates range between 0.40 and 1.25 of average daily net assets. Average daily net assets of the Hennessy Funds for fiscal year 2023 was 3.0 billion, which represents a decrease of 0.7 billion, or 17.9 , compared to fiscal year 2022. The Hennessy Fund with the largest average daily net assets for fiscal year 2023 was the Hennessy Focus Fund, with 684 million. We collect an investment advisory fee from the Hennessy Focus Fund at an annual rate of 0.90 of average daily net assets. However, we pay a sub advisory fee at an annual rate of 0.29 to the fund s sub advisor, which reduces the net operating profit contribution of the fund to our financial operations. The Hennessy Fund with the second largest average daily net assets for fiscal year 2023 was the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund, with 509 million. We collect an investment advisory fee from the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund at an annual rate of 0.40 of average daily net assets.

Total assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2023 was 3.0 billion, an increase of 0.1 billion, or 4.7 , compared to the end of fiscal year 2022. The increase in total assets was attributable to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of the Hennessy Funds. 
 
 The Hennessy Funds with the three largest amounts of net inflows were as follows:

 (82) million 

Redemptions as a percentage of assets under management decreased from an average of 2.6 per month during fiscal year 2022 to an average of 2.5 per month during fiscal year 2023. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Comparing fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023, total operating expenses decreased by 10.8 , from 19.8 million to 17.7 million. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreases in sub-advisory fee, compensation and benefits, and fund distribution and other expenses, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative and depreciation expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 6.8 percentage points to 73.6 . 
 
 Compensation and Benefits Expense : Comparing fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023, compensation and benefits expense decreased by 7.1 , from 8.3 million to 7.7 million. As a percentage of total revenue, compensation and benefits expense increased 4.2 percentage points to 32.2 . The decrease in dollar value of compensation and benefits expense was due primarily to a decrease in head count and incentive-based compensation during fiscal year 2023. 
 
 General and Administrative Expense : Comparing fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023, general and administrative expense increased by 8.8 from 5.0 million to 5.5 million. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expense increased 5.8 percentage points to 22.8 . The increase in general and administrative expense was due to an increase in professional services, including investment banking, legal and marketing costs, in the current period. 
 
 Fund Distribution and Other Expense : The distribution component of fund distribution and other expense consists of fees paid to various financial institutions that offer the Hennessy Funds as potential investments to their clients. When the Hennessy Funds are purchased through one of these financial institutions, the institution typically charges an asset based fee, which is recorded as a fund distribution expense on our statement of operations to the extent paid by us. The Hennessy Mutual Funds, with the exception of the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF, may be purchased directly, and when purchased directly, we do not incur any such expense. These fees generally increase or decrease in line with the net assets of the Hennessy Funds held through these financial institutions, which are affected by inflows, outflows, and fund performance. In addition, some financial institutions charge a minimum fee if the average daily net assets of a Hennessy Fund held by such an institution are less than a threshold amount. In such cases, we pay the minimum fee. 

36

Table of Contents 

The distribution component of fund distribution and other expenses is affected by many factors, including the following: 

average daily net assets held by financial institutions; 

the split of average daily net assets held by financial institutions in Institutional Class shares of the Hennessy Mutual Funds versus Investor Class shares of the Hennessy Mutual Funds; and 

fee minimums at various financial institutions. 

The other component of fund distribution and other expense consists of fees incurred by us for the operations of the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. We receive a unitary investment advisory fee from the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF and then pay all of its operating expenses (with limited exceptions), including fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agency, custody, licensing, audit, and tax services. 
 
 Comparing fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023, fund distribution and other expense decreased by 9.3 , from 0.54 million to 0.49 million. As a percentage of total revenue, fund distribution and other expense increased 0.2 percentage points to 2.0 . The decrease in dollar value of fund distribution and other expense was primarily due to decreased average daily net assets of the Hennessy Mutual Funds, which in turn decreases the fees we pay to financial institutions. The decrease was partly offset by the expense associated with the operations of the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF that began in December 2022. 
 
 Sub-Advisory Fees Expense : Comparing fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023, sub advisory fees expense decreased by 34.4 , from 5.7 million to 3.8 million. As a percentage of total revenue, sub advisory fees expense decreased 3.7 percentage points to 15.6 . The decrease in sub advisory fees expense was due to a decrease in average daily net assets of the sub advised Hennessy Funds, with an additional decrease as a result of us no longer paying sub advisory fees with respect to the Hennessy Energy Transition Fund and the Hennessy Midstream Fund after January 31, 2022. The decrease was partly offset by the expense associated with new sub advisory relationships relating to the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF that began in December 2022. 
 
 Depreciation Expense : Comparing fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023, depreciation expense increased by 11.1 from 0.21 million to 0.23 million due to additional fixed asset purchases. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation expense increased 0.3 percentage points to 1.0 . 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Comparing fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023, interest expense increased by 6.3 from 2.1 to 2.3 million. The increase in interest expense was due to a full period of 2026 Notes interest expense incurred in the current period. The 2026 Notes were issued on October 20, 2021, and therefore incurred a partial period of interest expense in the first quarter of the prior comparable period. 
 
 Interest Income 
 
 Comparing fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023, interest income increased from 0.2 to 2.5 million. The increase was due to rising interest rates. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 Comparing fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023, income tax expense increased by 4.2 , from 1.76 million to 1.83 million. The increase in income tax expense was due to a higher effective income tax rate, partially offset by lower net operating income in the current period. The higher effective tax rate in the current period is due to the release of a portion of uncertain tax benefit position in the prior comparable period, as discussed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Comparing fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023, net income decreased by 22.9 , from 6.2 million to 4.8 million. The decrease in net income was primarily due to decreased average assets under management in the current period, which resulted in lower revenue and net operating income.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 We continually review our capital requirements to ensure that we have funding available to support our business model. Management anticipates that cash and other liquid assets on hand as of the end of fiscal year 2023 will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for one year from the issuance date of this report, as well as our longer term capital requirements for periods beyond one year from the issuance date of this report. To the extent that liquid resources and cash provided by operations are not adequate to meet long-term capital requirements, management plans to raise additional capital by either, or both, seeking bank financing or accessing the capital markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital. 
 
 On October 20, 2021, we completed a public offering of our 2026 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of 40.25 million, which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after December 31, 2023. The 2026 Notes bear interest at 4.875 per annum, payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and at maturity, beginning December 31, 2021. The 2026 Notes are direct unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with any of our future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides that it is subordinate to the 2026 Notes, effectively subordinate to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any future subsidiaries of ours. 
 
 Our total assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2023 was 3.0 billion, an increase of 0.1 billion, or 4.7 , compared to the end of fiscal year 2022. The primary sources of our revenues, liquidity, and cash flow are our investment advisory fees and shareholder service fees, which are based on, and generated by, our average assets under management. Our average assets under management for fiscal year 2023 was 3.0 billion. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 60.5 million.

 The increase in cash used in investing activities of 0.6 million was due to the purchase of assets related to the management of an ETF that were reorganized into the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF and the costs associated with the definitive agreement signed with CCM in the current period. 
 
 The decrease in cash provided by financing activities of 38.5 million was due to the issuance of the 2026 Notes in the prior comparable period. 
 
 Dividend Payments . We have consistently paid dividends each year since 2005. Our quarterly dividend rate remained constant during fiscal years 2023 and 2022, and our dividend payments totaled 4.2 and 4.1 million in each such fiscal year, respectively. 
 
 2026 Notes . On October 20, 2021, we completed a public offering of our 2026 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of 40.25 million, which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option. The 2026 Notes bear interest at 4.875 per annum, payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and at maturity, beginning December 31, 2021. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. These accounting policies, methods, and estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments. Those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events. Certain accounting policies, methods, and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgment. Described below are the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding our results of operations and financial position. 
 
 Our operating revenues consist of contractual investment advisory and shareholder service fees. We earn our investment advisory fees through portfolio management of the Hennessy Funds, and we earn our shareholder service fees by assisting investors in the Hennessy Mutual Funds. These fee revenues are earned and calculated daily by the Hennessy Funds accountants. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB guidance on revenue recognition, we recognize fee revenues monthly. Our contractual agreements provide persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists with fixed and determinable fees, and the services are rendered daily. The collectability is probable as the fees are received from the Hennessy Funds in the month subsequent to the month in which the services are provided. 
 
 The management contracts we have purchased are considered intangible assets with an indefinite life and we account for them in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 350: Intangibles Goodwill and Other ASC 350 ). Pursuant to ASC 350, an entity first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If an entity determines that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired, then it must conduct an impairment analysis. We were able to forego the annual impairment analysis for fiscal year 2023 as the more-likely-than-not threshold was not met as of the end of fiscal year 2023. 
 
 The costs related to our purchase of the assets related to the management of investment funds are capitalized as incurred. The costs are defined as an intangible asset per the FASB standard Intangibles Goodwill and Other. The acquisition costs include legal fees, fees for soliciting shareholder approval, and a percent of asset costs to purchase the management contracts. The amounts are included in the management contract asset, totaling 81.3 million as of the end of fiscal year 2023. 
 
 RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 
 We reviewed accounting pronouncements issued between December 7, 2022, the filing date of our most recent previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, and December 6, 2023, the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and have determined that no accounting pronouncement issued would have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or disclosures. 
 
 There have been no other significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during fiscal year 2023.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Hennessy Advisors, Inc.: 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Hennessy Advisors, Inc. (the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Valuation of Management Contract Asset Impairment Consideration 
 
 As described in Note 1(f) to the financial statements, the Company has historically capitalized the cost of purchasing management contracts as intangible assets. These intangible assets are considered to have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized, but rather tested at least annually for impairment. As part of this annual test, management (i) evaluates whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment exists, and/or (ii) estimates the fair value of such intangible assets and compares it to the cost of the assets to determine whether impairment has occurred. Management s estimate of the fair value of management contract assets involves subjective assumptions that include stock market returns, fund flows and weighted average cost of capital. 
 
 We have determined that the valuation of management contract assets constitutes a critical audit matter for the following reasons: (i) it is a matter that should be communicated to the audit committee, since it involves a significant management estimate; (ii) it involves a material account balance; and (iii) it involves especially subjective auditor judgment. 
 
 We have addressed this critical audit matter by performing appropriate audit procedures. These procedures included (i) assessing management s evaluation of whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment exists; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of management s fair value estimate assumptions; and (iii) testing the mathematical accuracy of management s valuation model. Professionals with specialized skills and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating of the measurement of the Company s estimated fair value of the management contract assets.

Notes to Financial Statements 

open-end mutual funds and exchange traded fund ETF branded as the Hennessy Funds. The Company serves as the investment advisor to all classes of the Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund, the Hennessy Focus Fund, the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund, the Hennessy Cornerstone Large Growth Fund, the Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund, the Hennessy Total Return Fund, the Hennessy Equity and Income Fund, the Hennessy Balanced Fund, the Hennessy Energy Transition Fund, the Hennessy Midstream Fund, the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund, the Hennessy Japan Fund, the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund, the Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund, the Hennessy Small Cap Financial Fund, and the Hennessy Technology Fund (collectively, the Hennessy Mutual Funds ), as well as to the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. The Company also provides shareholder services to investors in the Hennessy Mutual Funds. 
 
 The employee retention credit ERC ), as originally enacted on March 27, 2020, by the CARES Act, was a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes equal to 50 of the qualified wages an eligible employer paid to employees and allowed claims through December 31, 2021, by eligible employers who retained employees during the COVID 19 pandemic. The Company filed Form 941 X to request an ERC from the Internal Revenue Service. In May 2023, the Company received an ERC of approximately million plus accrued interest. For profit entities do not have specific guidance to apply under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to account for ERCs and therefore follow guidance in accordance with Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance IAS 20 ). In accordance with IAS 20, the Company is netting the credit against related payroll expense in the current period. 
 
 The Company s operating revenues consist of contractual investment advisory and shareholder service fees paid to it by the Hennessy Funds. The Company earns investment advisory fees from each Hennessy Fund by, among other things: 
 
 acting as portfolio manager for the fund or overseeing the sub advisor acting as portfolio manager for the fund, which includes managing the composition of the fund s portfolio (including the purchase, retention, and disposition of portfolio securities in accordance with the fund s investment objectives, policies, and restrictions), seeking best execution for the fund s portfolio, managing the use of soft dollars for the fund, and managing proxy voting for the fund; 

performing a daily reconciliation of portfolio positions and cash for the fund; 

monitoring the liquidity of the fund; 

monitoring the fund s compliance with its investment objectives and restrictions and federal securities laws; 

maintaining a compliance program (including a code of ethics), conducting ongoing reviews of the compliance programs of the fund s service providers (including any sub advisor), including their codes of ethics, as appropriate, conducting on site visits to the fund s service providers (including any sub-advisor) as feasible, monitoring incidents of abusive trading practices, reviewing fund expense accruals, payments, and fixed expense ratios, evaluating insurance providers for fidelity bond, directors and officers and errors and omissions insurance, and cybersecurity insurance coverage, managing regulatory examination compliance and responses, conducting employee compliance training, reviewing reports provided by service providers, and maintaining books and records; 

if applicable, overseeing the selection and continued employment of the fund s sub advisor, reviewing the fund s investment performance, and monitoring the sub advisor s adherence to the fund s investment objectives, policies, and restrictions; 

overseeing service providers that provide accounting, administration, distribution, transfer agency, custodial, sales, marketing, public relations, audit, information technology, and legal services to the fund; 

maintaining in house marketing and distribution departments on behalf of the fund; 

preparing or directing the preparation of all regulatory filings for the fund, including writing and annually updating the fund s prospectus and related documents; 

for each annual report of the fund, preparing or reviewing a written summary of the fund s performance during the most recent 12 month period; 

monitoring and overseeing the accessibility of the fund on financial institution platforms; 

paying the incentive compensation of the fund s compliance officer and employing other staff such as legal, marketing, national accounts, distribution, sales, administrative, and trading oversight personnel, as well as management executives; 

providing a quarterly compliance certification to the Board of Trustees of Hennessy Funds Trust (the Funds Board of Trustees ); and 

preparing or reviewing materials for the Funds Board of Trustees, presenting to or leading discussions with the Funds Board of Trustees, preparing or reviewing all meeting minutes, and arranging for training and education of the Funds Board of Trustees. 

The Company earns shareholder service fees from Investor Class shares of the Hennessy Mutual Funds by, among other things, maintaining a toll free number that the current investors in the Hennessy Funds may call to ask questions about their accounts and actively participating as a liaison between investors in the Hennessy Funds and U.S. Bank Global Fund Services. 
 
 Investment advisory and shareholder service fee revenues are earned and calculated daily by the Hennessy Funds accountants at U.S. Bank Global Fund Services and are subsequently reviewed by management. 
 
 The Company recognizes revenues when its obligations related to the investment advisory and shareholder services are satisfied, and it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue amount would not occur in future periods. Management judgment is required in assessing the probability of significant revenue reversal and in identification of distinct services. Investment advisory and shareholder services are performed over time because investors in the Hennessy Funds are receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the Company. Fees are based on contractual percentages of net asset values and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. Such fees are affected by changes in net asset values, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation, and net inflows or outflows. Assets under management represent the broad range of financial assets the Company manages for the Hennessy Funds on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and shareholder servicing agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported assets under management reflect the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue. The fees are computed and billed monthly, at which time they are recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. 

The Company waives a portion of its fees with respect to the Hennessy Midstream Fund, the Hennessy Technology Fund, and the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF to comply with contractual expense ratio limitations. The fee waivers are calculated daily by the Hennessy Funds accountants at U.S. Bank Global Fund Services, reviewed by management, and then charged to expense monthly as offsets to the Company s revenues. Each waived fee is then deducted from investment advisory fee income and reduces the aggregate amount of advisory fees the Company receives from such fund in the subsequent month. To date, the Company has only waived fees based on contractual obligations, but the Company has the ability to waive fees at its discretion. Any decision to waive fees would apply only on a going forward basis. 
 
 The Company s contractual agreements for investment advisory and shareholder services prove that a contract exists with fixed and determinable fees, and the services are rendered daily. The collectability is deemed probable because the fees are received from the Hennessy Funds in the month subsequent to the month in which the services are provided. 

per year were recognized in operations for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 . 
 
 Dividend income is recorded on the ex dividend date. Purchases and sales of marketable securities are recorded on a trade date basis, and realized gains and losses recognized on sale are determined on a specific identification/average cost basis. 

"more-likely-than- not" impairment trigger as of such dates. 

Under Accounting Standards Codification 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. The Company considered various factors, such as likelihood of continued renewal, whether there are foreseeable limits on net cash flows, and whether the Company is dependent on a limited number of investors, in determining the useful life of the management contracts. Based on analysis, the Company considers the management contract asset to be an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life and no impairment as of the end of fiscal year 2023 . 
 
 The Company completed its most recent asset purchase on December 22, 2022, when it purchased certain assets related to the management of the Stance Equity ESG Large Cap Core ETF (the Stance ETF ). This asset purchase added approximately million to the Company s assets under management at the time of closing. The purchase was consummated in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement, dated as of August 29, 2022, among the Company, Stance Capital, LLC, and Red Gate Advisers, LLC, among others. Upon completion of the transaction, the assets related to the management of the Stance ETF were reorganized into a newly formed series of Hennessy Funds Trust named the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. In connection with the transaction, Stance Capital, LLC and Vident Investment Advisory, LLC VIA became sub-advisors to the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. In July 2023, VIA completed an acquisition transaction that resulted in a change of control of VIA and automatic termination of the Company s sub advisory agreement with VIA. On the same date, the Company entered into a new sub advisory agreement with Vident Advisory, LLC. As of September 30, 2023, the Company capitalized a total of million under this transaction, all of which remained payable as of September 30, 2022, and was paid during the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 On April 26, 2023, the Company announced that it has signed a definitive agreement with Community Capital Management, LLC CCM related to the management of the CCM Core Impact Equity Fund and the CCM Small/Mid-Cap Impact Value Fund (the CCM Equity Funds ). The definitive agreement includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants of the parties to the agreement. It provides for payment by the Company to be made upon closing equal to of the aggregate current net asset value of the CCM Equity Funds measured as of the close of business two trading days prior to the closing date of the transaction. The Company expects to complete the transaction during calendar 2023. 
 
 In the current period, the Company capitalized million in legal costs related to the transaction. Upon completion of the transaction, the assets of the CCM Equity Funds will be reorganized into the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of the CCM Equity Funds shareholders. 

The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and multiple state jurisdictions. The Company s U.S. federal income taxes for 2019 through 2023 remain open and subject to examination. The Company has identified 22 major state tax jurisdictions in which it is subject to income tax, which include California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. For tax years that remain open, the below chart shows the number of such state tax jurisdictions that remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies:

of the number of outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, subject to adjustment by the compensation committee of the Company s Board of Directors upon the occurrence of certain events. The 50 limitation does not invalidate any awards made prior to a decrease in the number of outstanding shares, even if such awards have result or may result in shares constituting more than 50 of the outstanding shares being available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan. Shares available under the Omnibus Plan that are not awarded in one particular year may be awarded in subsequent years. 
 
 The compensation committee of the Company s Board of Directors has the authority to determine the awards granted under the Omnibus Plan, including among other things, the individuals who receive the awards, the times when they receive them, vesting schedules, performance goals, whether an option is an incentive or nonqualified option, and the number of shares to be subject to each award. However, no participant may receive options or stock appreciation rights under the Omnibus Plan for an aggregate of more than shares in any calendar year. The exercise price and term of each option or stock appreciation right is fixed by the compensation committee except that the exercise price for each stock option that is intended to qualify as an incentive stock option must be at least equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and the term of the option cannot exceed years. In the case of an incentive stock option granted to a or more shareholder, the exercise price must be at least of the fair market value on the date of grant and cannot exceed five years. Incentive stock options may be granted only within 10 years from the date of shareholder approval of the Omnibus Plan (which was March 2014 ). The aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the option is granted) of shares with respect to which incentive stock options may be granted to any one individual, which stock options are exercisable for the first time during any calendar year, may not exceed . An optionee may, with the consent of the compensation committee, elect to pay for the shares to be received upon exercise of his or her options in cash, shares of common stock, or any combination thereof. 

Under the Omnibus Plan, participants may be granted RSUs, each of which represents an unfunded, unsecured right to receive a share of the Company s common stock on the date specified in the recipient s award. The Company issues new shares of its common stock when it is required to deliver shares to an RSU recipient. The RSUs granted under the Omnibus Plan vest over four years at a rate of per year. The Company recognizes stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the four -year vesting term of each award. 
 
 All compensation costs related to RSUs vested during fiscal years 2023 and 2022 have been recognized in the financial statements. 
 
 The Company has available up to shares of the Company s common stock in respect of granted stock awards, in accordance with terms of the Omnibus Plan. 
 
 A summary of RSU activity is as follows:

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan 
 
 In January 2021, the Company adopted an updated Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the DRSPP ), replacing the previous Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan that had been in place since 2018. The DRSPP provides shareholders and new investors with a convenient and economical means of purchasing shares of the Company s common stock and reinvesting cash dividends paid on the Company s common stock. Under the DRSPP, the Company issued and shares of common stock in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 , respectively. The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the DRSPP is , of which shares remained available for issuance as of September 30, 2023 . 

Stock Buyback Program 
 
 In August 2010, the Company s Board of Directors adopted a stock buyback program pursuant to which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to shares of its common stock in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. The program does not have an expiration date. In August 2022, the Board of Directors increased the number of shares that may be repurchased under the program to shares. As a result, a total of shares remains available for repurchase under the stock buyback program. The Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock pursuant to the stock buyback program during fiscal year 2023 .

The Company considers the management contract asset to be an intangible asset per Accounting Standards Codification 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other. The purchase costs that comprise the management contract asset include consideration to the seller, as well as legal and similar external transaction costs. 

Hennessy Funds. 

The investment advisory agreements must be renewed annually (except in limited circumstances) by (a) the Funds Board of Trustees or the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable Hennessy Fund and (b) the vote of a majority of the trustees of Hennessy Funds Trust who are not interested persons of the Hennessy Funds. If an investment advisory agreement is not renewed, it terminates automatically. There are two additional circumstances in which an investment advisory agreement terminates. First, an investment advisory agreement automatically terminates if the Company assigns it to another advisor (assignment includes indirect assignment, which is the transfer of the Company s common stock in sufficient quantities deemed to constitute a controlling block). Second, an investment advisory agreement may be terminated prior to its expiration upon days written notice by either the applicable Hennessy Fund or the Company. 
 
 As provided in each investment advisory agreement, the Company receives investment advisory fees monthly based on a percentage of the applicable fund s average daily net asset value. 
 
 The Company has entered into sub-advisory agreements for the Hennessy Focus Fund, the Hennessy Equity and Income Fund, the Hennessy Japan Fund, the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund, and the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. Under each of these sub-advisory agreements, the sub advisor is responsible for the investment and reinvestments of the assets of the applicable Hennessy Fund in accordance with the terms of such agreement and the applicable Hennessy Fund s Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information. The sub advisors are subject to the direction, supervision, and control of the Company and the Funds Board of Trustees. The sub advisory agreements must be renewed annually (except in limited circumstances) in the same manner as, and are subject to the same termination provisions as, the investment advisory agreements. 
 
 In exchange for the sub-advisory services, the Company not the Hennessy Funds) pays sub-advisory fees to the sub-advisors out of its own assets. Sub advisory fees are calculated as a percentage of the applicable sub advised fund s average daily net asset value. 
 
 Effective January 31, 2022, the Company and BP Capital Fund Services, LLC mutually agreed to terminate the sub-advisory agreement for the Hennessy Energy Transition Fund and the Hennessy Midstream Fund. Those funds are now managed internally by the Company. 

million on its balance sheet. The renewed lease expires on July 31, 2024, and is therefore a short-term operating lease as of September 30, 2023. There were no other long term operating leases as of the end of fiscal year 2023 . 
 
 Right of use assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the Company s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right of use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The Company s lease terms may include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise any such options. For its leases, the Company concluded that it is not reasonably certain that any renewal options would be exercise, and, therefore, the amounts are not recognized as part of operating lease right of use assets or operating lease liabilities. Leases with initial terms of 12 months or less and certain office equipment leases that are deemed insignificant are not recorded on the balance sheet and are expensed as incurred and included within rent expense under general and administrative expense. Lease expense related to operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease terms. 

The Company s most significant leases are real estate leases of office facilities. The Company leases office space under non-cancelable operating leases. Its principal executive office is located in Novato, California, and it has additional offices in Austin, Texas, Dallas, Texas, Boston, Massachusetts, and Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Only the office lease in Novato, California has been capitalized because the other operating leases have terms of 12 months or less, including leases that are month to month in nature. The classification of the Company s operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities and other supplemental information related to the Company s operating leases are as follows: 

Current operating lease liability 
 Long-term operating lease liability 
 Weighted average remaining lease term 
 Weighted average discount rate 

For fiscal years 2023 and 2022 , the Company s lease payments related to its operating lease right-of-use assets totaled million and million, respectively, and total rent expense for all offices, which is recorded under general and administrative expense in the statements of income, totaled million and million, respectively. 
 
 The undiscounted cash flows for future maturities of the Company s operating lease liabilities and the reconciliation to the balance of operating lease liabilities reflected on the Company s balance sheet are as follows: 

Present value discount 
 Total operating lease liabilities 

Accrued sub-advisor fees 

Other accrued expenses

notes due 2026 in the aggregate principal amount of (the 2026 Notes ), which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option. The initial net proceeds received were approximately after considering the impact of issuance costs and underwriter discounts. The 2026 Notes bear interest at 4.875 per annum, payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and at maturity, beginning December 31, 2021. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026 . 

The 2026 Notes are direct unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with any of the Company s future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of the Company s future indebtedness that expressly provides that it is subordinate to the 2026 Notes, effectively subordinate to all of the Company s existing and future secured indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Company s future subsidiaries.

million and million, respectively. If the tax benefits of such amounts were recognized, million and million of such amounts, respectively, would decrease the Company s effective income tax rate. The Company s net liability for accrued interest and penalties was million as of each of September 30, 2023 , and September 30, 2022 . The Company has elected to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. During the years ended September 30, 2023 , and September 30, 2022 , the Company recognized approximately million and million in interest and penalties, respectively. 
 
 The Company s activity was as follows: 

Decrease related to prior year tax positions 
 Ending year balance 

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to final regulations, audit settlements, tax examinations activities, lapse of applicable statutes of limitations, and the recognition and measurement criteria under the guidance related to accounting for uncertainly in income taxes. The Company is unable to estimate what this change could be within the next 12 months, but does not believe it would be material to its financial statements. 

The Company s income tax expense was as follows: 

State 
 Total Current 
 Deferred 
 Federal 
 State 
 Total Deferred 
 Total 

The principal reasons for the differences from the federal statutory income tax rate and the Company s effective tax rate were as follows: 

State income taxes, net of federal benefit 
 Permanent and other differences 
 Difference due to executive compensation 
 Tax return to provision adjustments 
 Uncertain tax position 
 Stock-based compensation

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

MANAGEMENT S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a 15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, using the criteria set forth in 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 
 
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2023, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS 
 
 There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023, and that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The Adviser shall supervise and manage the investment portfolio of each Fund, and, subject to such policies as the trustees of the Trust may determine, direct the purchase and sale of investment securities in the day to day management of each Fund. The Adviser shall for all purposes herein be deemed an independent contractor and shall, unless otherwise expressly provided or authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the Trust or any Fund in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Trust or any Fund. However, one or more shareholders, officers, directors, or employees of the Adviser may serve as a trustee or officer of the Trust, but without compensation or reimbursement of expenses for such services from the Trust unless otherwise determined by the Trust s Board of Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of the Trust. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to require the Trust to take any action contrary to its Trust Instrument, as it may be amended from time to time, or any applicable statute or regulation, or to relieve or deprive the trustees of the Trust of their responsibility for, and control of, the affairs of the Trust. 

3. Use of Sub-Advisers . All services to be furnished by the Adviser under this Agreement may be furnished through the medium of any managers, officers or employees of the Adviser or through such other parties (including, without limitation, a sub-adviser) as the Adviser may determine from time to time. Each sub-advisory agreement may provide that the applicable sub-adviser, subject to the control and supervision of the Trust s Board of Trustees and the Adviser, shall have full investment discretion for the applicable Fund, shall make all determinations with respect to the investment of such Fund s assets assigned to it and the purchase and sale of portfolio securities with those assets, and shall take such steps as may be necessary to implement its investment decisions.

5. Compensation of the Adviser . For the services and facilities to be rendered, the Trust through each Fund shall pay to the Adviser an advisory fee, paid monthly, based on the average daily net assets of each such Fund, as determined by valuations made as of the close of each business day during the month. The advisory fee payable by each Fund is set forth on Schedule A hereto. For any month in which this Agreement is not in effect for the entire month, such fee shall be reduced proportionately on the basis of the number of calendar days during which it is in effect and the fee computed upon the average daily net assets of the business days during which it is so in effect. 

2

6. Ownership of Shares of the Funds . The Adviser shall not take, and shall not permit any of its shareholders, officers, directors, or employees to take, a long or short position in the shares of a Fund, except for the purchase of shares of the Fund for investment purposes at the same price as that available to the public at the time of purchase. 

7. Exclusivity . The services of the Adviser to the Trust hereunder are not to be deemed exclusive, and the Adviser shall be free to furnish similar services to others as long as the services hereunder are not impaired thereby. Although the Adviser has permitted and is permitting the Trust and one or more Funds to use the name Hennessy, it is understood and agreed that the Adviser reserves the right to use, and to permit other persons, firms, or corporations, including other investment companies, to use, such name, and that the Trust and the Funds will not use such name if the Adviser ceases to be each Fund s sole investment adviser (not including any sub-advisers engaged pursuant to Section 3). During the period that this Agreement is in effect, the Adviser shall be each Fund s sole investment adviser (not including any sub-advisers engaged pursuant to Section 3).

9. Indemnification . The Adviser agrees to indemnify each Fund with respect to any loss, liability, judgment, cost, or penalty that such Fund may directly or indirectly suffer or incur as a result of a material breach by the Adviser of its standard of care set forth in Section 8. The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, agrees to indemnify the Adviser with respect to any loss, liability, judgment, cost, or penalty that the Adviser may directly or indirectly suffer or incur in any way arising out of the performance of its duties under this Agreement, except to the extent that such loss, liability, judgment, cost, or penalty was a result of a material breach by the Adviser of its standard of care set forth in Section 8. 

10. Brokerage Commissions . The Adviser, subject to the control and direction of the trustees of the Trust, shall have authority and discretion to select brokers and dealers to execute portfolio transactions for each Fund and to select the markets on or in which the transactions will be executed. The Adviser may cause each Fund to pay a broker dealer that provides brokerage or research services, as such services are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), to the Adviser a commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount another broker dealer would have charged for effecting such transaction, if the Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of brokerage and research services provided by the executing broker dealer viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the Adviser s overall responsibilities with respect to the accounts as to which the Adviser exercises investment discretion (as defined in Section 3(a)(35) of the Exchange Act). The Adviser shall provide such reports as the trustees of the Trust may reasonably request with respect to each Fund s brokerage commissions, the manner in which that brokerage was allocated, and brokerage and research services received.

11. Code of Ethics . The Adviser has adopted a written code of ethics complying with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and has provided the Trust with a copy of the code of ethics and evidence of its adoption. Upon written request of the Trust, the Adviser shall permit the Trust to examine any reports required to be made by the Adviser pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, to the extent such reports are not required, pursuant to Rule 17j-1, to be made to the Trust. 

12. Amendments . This Agreement may be amended by the mutual consent of the parties; provided, however, that in no event may it be amended without the approval of the trustees of the Trust in the manner required by the Investment Company Act, and, if required by the Investment Company Act, by the vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities of the affected Fund, as defined in the Investment Company Act.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time with respect to a Fund, without the payment of any penalty, by the trustees of the Trust or by a vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities of that Fund, as defined in the Investment Company Act, upon giving 60 days written notice to the Adviser. This Agreement may be terminated by the Adviser at any time upon the giving of 60 days written notice to the Trust. This Agreement shall terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in Section 2(a)(4) of the Investment Company Act). Subject to prior termination as hereinbefore provided, this Agreement shall continue in effect for two years from the date hereof and indefinitely thereafter, but only so long as the continuance after such two-year period is specifically approved annually by (a) the trustees of the Trust or by the vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities of each Fund, as defined in the Investment Company Act, and (b) the trustees of the Trust in the manner required by the Investment Company Act, provided that any such approval may be made effective not more than 60 days thereafter.

5. 

COMPENSATION OF THE ADVISER 

For the services provided and expenses assumed pursuant to this Agreement with respect to each Fund, the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, shall pay to the Adviser an advisory fee, paid monthly, based on the average daily net assets of each such Fund, as determined by valuations made as of the close of each business day during the month. The advisory fee payable by each Fund is set forth on Schedule A hereto. For any month in which this Agreement is not in effect for the entire month, such fee shall be reduced proportionately on the basis of the number of calendar days during which it is in effect and the fee computed upon the average daily net assets of the business days during which it is so in effect. The advisory fee payable by a Fund shall be satisfied only against the assets of the Fund and not against the assets of any other investment series of the Trust. The Adviser may from time to time agree not to impose all or a portion of its fee otherwise payable hereunder (in advance of the time such fee or portion thereof would otherwise accrue) and/or undertake to reimburse a Fund for all or a portion of its expenses not otherwise required to be borne or reimbursed by the Adviser. 

6. 

OWNERSHIP OF SHARES OF THE FUNDS 

The Adviser shall not take, and shall not permit any of its shareholders, officers, directors or employees to take, a long or short position in the shares of a Fund, except for the purchase of shares of the Fund for investment purposes at the same price as that available to the public at the time of purchase. 

3

7. 

NON-EXCLUSIVITY 

The services of the Adviser hereunder are not to be deemed exclusive and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict the right of the Adviser to provide investment advisory services or other services to any other person or entity, and the performance of such services shall not be deemed to violate or give rise to any duty or obligation to the Trust. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the Adviser or any of its directors, officers, or affiliates from purchasing, selling or trading in any securities for its or their own accounts, provided, however, that the Adviser expressly represents that it will not undertake activities which will adversely affect the performance of its obligations to a Fund under this Agreement. The Adviser agrees that this Section 7 does not constitute a waiver by the Trust of the obligations imposed upon the Adviser under Sections 17(d) and 17(j) of the Investment Company Act, Section 206 of the Advisers Act and the rules thereunder, or otherwise arising under federal or state law. During the period that this Agreement is in effect, the Adviser shall be each Fund s sole investment adviser (not including any Sub-Advisers engaged pursuant to Section 3 ). 

8. 

RESERVATION OF NAME 

Although the Adviser has permitted and is permitting the Trust and one or more Funds to use the name Hennessy, it is understood and agreed that the Adviser reserves the right to use, and to permit other persons, firms, or corporations, including other investment companies, to use such name, and that the Trust and the Funds will not use such name if the Adviser ceases to be each Fund s sole investment adviser (not including any Sub-Advisers engaged pursuant to Section 3 ). 

9. 

LIABILITY 

In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of obligations or duties hereunder on the part of the Adviser, the Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Funds or to any shareholder of the Funds for any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering services hereunder, including any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, federal securities laws and certain state laws impose liabilities under certain circumstances on persons who have acted in good faith, and therefore nothing herein shall in any way constitute a waiver or limitation of any rights which the Trust, a Fund or any shareholder of a Fund may have under any federal securities law or state law. 

10. 

INDEMNIFICATION 

The Adviser agrees to indemnify each Fund with respect to any loss, liability, judgment, cost, or penalty that such Fund may directly or indirectly suffer or incur as a result of a material breach by the Adviser of its standard of care set forth in Section 9 . The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, agrees to indemnify the Adviser with respect to any loss, liability, judgment, cost or penalty that the Adviser may directly or indirectly suffer or incur in any way arising out of the performance of its duties under this Agreement, except to the extent that such loss, liability, judgment, cost, or penalty was a result of a material breach by the Adviser of its standard of care set forth in Section 9 . No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to protect any Trustee or officer of the Trust, or officer of the Adviser, from liability in violation of Sections 17(h) and (i) of the Investment Company Act. 

4

11. 

BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS 

Subject to the control and direction of the Trustees of the Trust and the Adviser s fiduciary obligation to obtain best price and execution, the Adviser shall have authority and discretion to select brokers and dealers to execute portfolio transactions on behalf of the applicable Fund and to select the markets on or in which the transactions will be executed. When the Adviser places orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Funds, in selecting brokers or dealers to execute such orders, the Adviser may cause each Fund to pay a broker dealer that provides brokerage or research services, as such services are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), to the Adviser a commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount another broker dealer would have charged for effecting such transaction, if the Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of each such commission paid to a broker is reasonable in relation to the value of brokerage and research services provided by the executing broker dealer viewed in terms of either that particular transaction to which the transaction relates or the Adviser s overall responsibilities with respect to the accounts as to which the Adviser exercises investment discretion (as defined in Section 3(a)(35) of the Exchange Act). The Adviser shall provide such reports as the Trustees of the Trust may reasonably request with respect to each Fund s brokerage commissions, the manner in which that brokerage was allocated and brokerage and research services received. On occasions when the Adviser deems the purchase or sale of a security to be in the best interest of the Fund as well as of other clients, the Adviser, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, may aggregate securities orders in a manner it considers to be the most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the applicable Fund(s) and to such other clients in order to obtain the most favorable price or lower brokerage commissions and the most efficient execution. 

12. 

CODE OF ETHICS 

The Adviser has adopted a written code of ethics complying with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and has provided the Trust with a copy of its code of ethics and evidence of its adoption.

The Fund shall be responsible for all custodial arrangements, including the payment of all fees and charges to the custodian. 

3. 

SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY THE SUB-ADVISER TO THE TRUST 

A. As an investment adviser to each Fund, the Sub-Adviser shall manage the securities and other assets of a Fund entrusted to it hereunder (the Assets ), including the purchase, retention and disposition of the Assets, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Fund s Prospectus and the Fund s Statement of Additional Information (the SAI (as each may be updated or amended, from time to time) and subject to the direction, supervision, and control of the Adviser and the Board. 

B. As part of the services it will provide hereunder, the Sub-Adviser shall: 

(i) Determine from time to time what Assets shall be purchased, retained or sold by the Funds and what portion of the Assets will be invested or held uninvested in cash as is permissible; 

(ii) Keep the Board and the Adviser fully informed in writing on an ongoing basis as agreed by the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser of all material facts concerning the investment and reinvestment of the Assets of each Fund, the Sub-Adviser and its key personnel and operations, make regular and periodic special written reports of such additional information concerning the same as may reasonably be requested from time to time by the Adviser or the Board and the Sub-Adviser will attend meetings with the Adviser and the Board, as reasonably requested, to discuss the foregoing; and 

(iii) Cooperate with and provide reasonable assistance to the Adviser, the Trust s administrator, custodian and foreign custodians, transfer agent and pricing agents and all other agents and representatives of the Trust and the Adviser, keep all such persons fully informed as to such matters as they may reasonably deem necessary to the performance of their obligations to the Trust and the Adviser, provide prompt responses to reasonable requests made by such persons and maintain any appropriate interfaces with each so as to promote the efficient exchange of information. 

2

C. The Sub-Adviser may place orders for the execution of transactions with or through such brokers, dealers or banks as the Sub-Adviser may select subject to the conditions set forth herein. The Sub-Adviser is directed at all times to seek to execute transactions on behalf of each Fund (i) in accordance with any written policies or procedures that may be established by the Board or the Adviser from time to time and which have been provided to the Sub-Adviser or (ii) as described in the Fund s Prospectus and SAI. When determining the Assets to be purchased or sold by the Funds, the Sub-Adviser shall use its best efforts to obtain for a Fund best execution, considering all of the circumstances, and shall maintain records adequate to demonstrate compliance with this requirement. Subject to Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), any policies and procedures approved by the Board, and other applicable law, the Sub-Adviser may cause each Fund to pay commissions for effecting a portfolio transaction in excess of the amount of commissions another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Adviser determines, in good faith, that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of such brokerage or research services provided viewed in terms of that particular transaction or the Sub-Adviser s overall responsibilities to the Fund or its other advisory clients. The Sub-Adviser will seek best execution under the circumstances of the particular transaction taking into consideration the full range and quality of a broker s services in placing brokerage including, among other things, the value of research provided as well as execution capability, commission rate, financial responsibility, and responsiveness to the Sub-Adviser (the determinative factor is not the lowest possible commission cost, but whether the transaction represents the best qualitative execution for a Fund). The Sub-Adviser may aggregate sales and purchase orders of securities or derivatives held in a Fund with similar orders being made simultaneously for other portfolios managed by the Sub-Adviser if, in the Sub-Adviser s reasonable judgment, such aggregation shall result in an overall economic benefit to the Fund. The Adviser understands and agrees that when such aggregation does occur the actual prices obtained will be averaged and the applicable Fund will be deemed to have purchased or sold its proportionate share of the securities involved at such average price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sub-Adviser will not effect any transaction with a broker or dealer that is an affiliated person (as defined under the Investment Company Act) of the Sub-Adviser or the Adviser without the prior approval of the Adviser. The Adviser shall provide the Sub-Adviser with a list of brokers or dealers that are affiliated persons of the Adviser. 

D. The Adviser understands and agrees and has advised the Board that the Sub Adviser performs investment management services for various clients and may take action with respect to any of its other clients that may differ from action taken or from the timing or nature of action taken by the Sub-Adviser for a particular Fund. The Adviser also acknowledges that the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are fiduciaries to other entities, some of which have similar investment objectives (and will hold the same investments) as the Funds, and that the Sub-Adviser will carry out its duties hereunder together with its duties under such relationships.

(iv) An annual certification regarding the Sub-Adviser s compliance with Rule 206(4) 7 under the Advisers Act and Section 38a 1 of the Investment Company Act, as well as the foregoing sub paragraphs (i) through (iii). 

F. The Sub-Adviser will maintain and preserve all accounts, books, and records with respect to the Assets of each Fund as are required of an investment adviser of a registered investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act and the Advisers Act and the rules thereunder and shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC all forms pursuant to Sections 13(d), 13(f), and 13(g) of the Exchange Act, with respect to its duties as are set forth herein. The Sub-Adviser agrees that all records it maintains on behalf of the Assets are property of the applicable Fund and the Sub-Adviser will surrender promptly to the Fund any of such records upon the Fund s request; provided, however, that Sub-Adviser shall retain a copy of such records. 

G. The Sub-Adviser will furnish, at its expense, all necessary facilities and personnel, including personnel compensation, expenses and fees required for the Sub-Adviser to perform its duties under this Agreement, administrative facilities, including operations and bookkeeping, and all equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of the Sub-Adviser s duties under this Agreement. 

H. The Sub-Adviser shall reasonably cooperate with the Adviser and/or the Trust in responding to any regulatory or compliance examinations or inspections (including any information requests) relating to the Trust, a Fund or the Adviser brought by any governmental or regulatory authorities.

4

J. The Sub-Adviser will not be responsible for proxy voting or any corporate actions relating to the Assets, including administrative filings, such as proofs or claims in class actions. 

K. The fair valuation of securities in a Fund may be required when the Adviser becomes aware of significant events that may affect the pricing of all or a portion of a Fund s portfolio. The Sub-Adviser will provide assistance in determining the fair value of the Assets, as necessary and reasonably requested by the Adviser or its agent, it being understood that the Sub-Adviser will not be responsible for determining the value of any such security. 

4. 

COMPENSATION OF THE SUB-ADVISER 

As compensation for providing services in accordance with this Agreement, the Adviser will pay the Sub-Adviser a sub-advisory fee at the rate set forth in Schedule A, calculated based on the average daily net assets under the Sub-Adviser s management with respect to the Fund and payable monthly.

The annual base fee will be prorated for such fees owed through the termination date. Except as may otherwise be prohibited by law or regulation (including, without limitation, any then current SEC interpretation), the Sub-Adviser may, in its discretion and from time to time, waive all or any portion of its sub-advisory fee.

Exhibit 97 

Hennessy Advisors, Inc. 
 Compensation Recovery Policy 

1. 

Purpose . The purpose of this Compensation Recovery Policy (this Policy is to describe the circumstances under which Hennessy Advisors, Inc. (the Company is required to recover certain compensation paid to certain employees. Any references in compensation plans, agreements, equity awards, or other policies to the Company s recoupment, clawback, or similarly-named policy shall be deemed to refer to this Policy with respect to Incentive-Based Compensation Received on or after the Effective Date. With respect to Incentive-Based Compensation Received prior to the Effective Date, such references to the Company s recoupment, clawback, or similarly-named policy in compensation plans, agreements, equity awards or other policies shall be deemed to refer to the Company s recoupment, clawback, or similarly-named policy, if any, in effect prior to the Effective Date. 

2. 

Mandatory Recovery of Compensation . In the event that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall recover reasonably promptly the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation. 

3. 

Definitions . For purposes of this Policy, the following terms, when capitalized, shall have the meanings set forth below: 

(a) 

Accounting Restatement shall mean any accounting restatement required due to material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. 

(b) 

Covered Officer shall mean the Company s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a significant policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar significant policy-making functions for the Company. 

(c) 

Effective Date shall mean October 2, 2023. 

(d) 

Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall mean the excess of (i) the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a person (A) after beginning service as a Covered Officer, (B) who served as a Covered Officer at any time during the performance period for that Incentive-Based Compensation, (C) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association, and (D) during the Recovery Period, over (ii) the Recalculated Compensation. For the avoidance of doubt, a person who served as a Covered Officer during the periods set forth in clauses (A) and (B) of the preceding sentence shall continue to be subject to this Policy even after such person s service as a Covered Officer has ended. 

1

(e) 

Incentive-Based Compensation shall mean any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure. A financial reporting measure is a measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures, regardless of whether such measure is presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Each of stock price and total shareholder return is a financial reporting measure. For the avoidance of doubt, incentive-based compensation subject to this Policy does not include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or similar equity-based awards for which the grant is not contingent upon achieving any financial reporting measure performance goal and vesting is contingent solely upon completion of a specified employment period or attaining one or more non-financial reporting measures. 

(f) 

Recalculated Compensation shall mean the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been Received had it been determined based on the restated amounts in the Accounting Restatement, computed without regard to any taxes paid. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement, the amount of the Recalculated Compensation must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return, as the case may be, on the compensation Received. The Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the national securities exchange or association on which its securities are listed. 

(g) 

Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed Received in the Company s fiscal period during which the financial reporting measure specified in the award of such Incentive-Based Compensation is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. 

(h) 

Recovery Period shall mean the three completed fiscal years of the Company immediately preceding the date the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement; provided that the Recovery Period shall not begin before the Effective Date. For purposes of determining the Recovery Period, the Company is considered to be required to prepare an Accounting Restatement on the earlier to occur of (i) the date the Company s Board of Directors, a committee thereof, or the Company s authorized officers conclude, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, or (ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. If the Company changes its fiscal year, then the transition period within or immediately following such three completed fiscal years also shall be included in the Recovery Period, provided that if the transition period between the last day of the Company s prior fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year comprises a period of nine to 12 months, then such transition period shall instead be deemed one of the three completed fiscal years and shall not extend the length of the Recovery Period. 

2

4. 

Exceptions . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation will not be required to the extent the Company s committee of independent directors responsible for executive compensation decisions (or a majority of the independent directors on the Company s board of directors in the absence of such a committee) has made a determination that such recovery would be impracticable and one of the following conditions have been satisfied: 

(a) 

The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered; provided that, before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that was Incentive-Based Compensation based on the expense of enforcement, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to the national securities exchange or association on which its securities are listed. 

(b) 

Recovery would violate home country law where, with respect to Incentive-Based Compensation, that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022; provided that, before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that was Incentive-Based Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company must obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the national securities exchange or association on which its securities are listed, that recovery would result in such a violation, and must provide such opinion to the exchange or association. 

(c) 

Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. 

5. 

Manner of Recovery . In addition to any other actions permitted by law or contract, the Company may take any or all of the following actions to recover any Erroneously Awarded Compensation: (a) require the Covered Officer to repay such amount, (b) offset such amount from any other compensation owed by the Company or any of its affiliates to the Covered Officer, regardless of whether the contract or other documentation governing such other compensation specifically permits or specifically prohibits such offsets, and (c) subject to Section 4(c), to the extent the Erroneously Awarded Compensation was deferred into a plan of deferred compensation, whether or not qualified, forfeit such amount (as well as the earnings on such amounts) from the Covered Officer s balance in such plan, regardless of whether the plan specifically permits or specifically prohibits such forfeiture. If the Erroneously Awarded Compensation consists of shares of the Company s common stock, and the Covered Officer still owns such shares, then the Company may satisfy its recovery obligations by requiring the Covered Officer to transfer such shares back to the Company. 

3

6. 

Other . 

(a) 

This Policy shall be administered and interpreted, and may be amended from time to time, by the Company s board of directors or any committee to which the board may delegate its authority in its sole discretion in compliance with the applicable listing standards of the national securities exchange or association on which the Company s securities are listed, and the determinations of the board or such committee shall be binding on all Covered Officers. 

(b) 

The Company shall not indemnify any Covered Officer against the loss of Erroneously Awarded Compensation. 

(c) 

The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the Federal securities laws, including disclosure required by the Securities and Exchange Commission filings. 

(d) 

Any right to recovery under this Policy shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights of recovery that may be available to the Company.
