 PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
 (a) General Development of Business 
 We are a leading global producer of industrial packaging products and services with operations in over 35 countries. We offer a comprehensive line of rigid industrial packaging products, such as steel, fibre and plastic drums, rigid intermediate bulk containers, jerrycans and other small plastics, closure systems for industrial packaging products, transit protection products, water bottles and remanufactured and reconditioned industrial containers, and services, such as container life cycle management, filling, logistics, warehousing and other packaging services. We produce and sell containerboard, corrugated sheets, corrugated containers and other corrugated products to customers in North America in industries such as packaging, automotive, food and building products. We also produce and sell coated recycled paperboard and uncoated recycled paperboard, some of which are used to produce and sell industrial products (tubes and cores, construction products and protective packaging). We also produce and sell bulk and specialty partitions made from both containerboard and uncoated recycled paperboard. In addition, we purchase and sell recycled fiber and produce and sell adhesives used in our paperboard products. We sell timber to third parties from our timberland in the southeastern United States that we manage to maximize long-term value. In addition, we sell, from time to time, timberland and special use land, which consists of surplus land, higher and better use HBU land and development land. Our customers range from Fortune 500 companies to medium and small-sized companies in a cross section of industries. 
 Our fiscal year begins on November 1 and ends on October 31 of the following year. Any references in this Form 10-K to the years, or to any quarter of those years, relates to the fiscal year or quarter, as the case may be, ended in that year, unless otherwise stated. 
 As used in this Form 10-K, the terms Greif, the Company, we, us, and our refer to Greif, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 See subsection (g) of this Item 1, Recent Events - Proposed Acquisition of Ipackchem, for information concerning our planned acquisition of Ipackchem Group SAS Ipackchem ), a global market leader in the production of high performance plastic packaging, including premium barrier and non-barrier jerrycans and small plastic containers, which was announced on October 31, 2023. Unless expressly identified herein, information in this Form 10-K does not reflect our proposed acquisition of Ipackchem or its business operations, products, services or financial results. 
 
 (b) Financial Information about Segments 
 We operate in six operating segments, which are aggregated into three reportable segments: Global Industrial Packaging; Paper Packaging Services; and Land Management. Information related to our reportable segments is included in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 
 (c) Narrative Description of Business 
 Sales 
 In the Global Industrial Packaging reportable segment, we are a leading global producer of industrial packaging products, such as steel, fibre and plastic drums, rigid intermediate bulk containers, jerrycans and other small plastics, closure systems for industrial packaging products, transit protection products, water bottles and remanufactured and reconditioned industrial containers, and services, such as container life cycle management, filling, logistics, warehousing and other packaging services. We sell our industrial packaging products on a global basis to customers in industries such as chemicals, paints and pigments, food and beverage, petroleum, industrial coatings, agriculture, pharmaceutical and minerals, among others. 
 In the Paper Packaging Services reportable segment, we produce and sell containerboard, corrugated sheets, corrugated containers and other corrugated products to customers in North America in industries such as packaging, automotive, food and building products. Our corrugated container products are used to ship such diverse products as home appliances, small machinery, grocery products, automotive components, books and furniture, as well as numerous other applications. We also produce and sell coated recycled paperboard and uncoated recycled paperboard, some of which are used to produce and sell industrial products (tubes and cores, construction products and protective packaging), which ultimately serve both industrial and consumer markets. We also produce and sell bulk and specialty partitions made from both containerboard and uncoated recycled board. In addition, we purchase and sell recycled fiber and produce and sell adhesives used in our paperboard products.

 In the Land Management reportable segment, we are focused on the active harvesting and regeneration of our United States timber properties to achieve sustainable long-term yields. While timber sales are subject to fluctuations, we seek to maintain a consistent cutting schedule, within the limits of market and weather conditions. We also sell, from time to time, timberland and special use land, which consists of surplus land, HBU land and development land. As of October 31, 2023, we owned approximately 175,000 acres of timber properties in the southeastern United States. 
 Due to the variety of our products, we have many customers buying different types of our products, and due to the scope of our sales, no one customer is considered principal in our total operations. 
 Markets 
 The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive with many participants. Although no single company dominates, we face significant competitors in each of our businesses. Our competitors include large vertically integrated companies as well as numerous smaller companies. The industries in which we compete are particularly sensitive to price fluctuations caused by shifts in industry capacity and other cyclical industry conditions. Other competitive factors include design, quality and service, with varying emphasis depending on product line. 
 In the global industrial packaging industry, we compete by offering a comprehensive line of products on a global basis. In the containerboard industry, we compete by concentrating on providing value-added, higher-margin corrugated products to niche markets. In our other paper packaging businesses, we compete by offering a comprehensive range of uncoated and coated paperboard products and diverse tube, core and other specialty products. 
 In addition, over the past several years we have closed higher cost facilities and otherwise restructured our operations, which we believe has significantly improved our cost competitiveness. 
 Resources 
 Steel, resin and containerboard, as well as used industrial packaging for reconditioning, are the principal raw materials for the Global Industrial Packaging reportable segment, and pulpwood, old corrugated containers and recycled coated and uncoated paperboard are the principal raw materials for the Paper Packaging Services reportable segment. We satisfy most of our needs for these raw materials through purchases on the open market or under short-term and long-term supply agreements. All of these raw materials are purchased in highly competitive, price-sensitive markets, which have historically exhibited price, demand and supply cyclicality. From time to time, some of these raw materials have been in short supply at certain of our manufacturing facilities. In those situations, we ship the raw materials in short supply from one or more of our other facilities with sufficient supply to the facility or facilities experiencing the shortage. To date, raw material shortages have not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Government Laws and Regulations 
 We must comply with extensive laws, rules and regulations in the United States and in each of the countries where we conduct business with respect to a variety of matters, including the compliance with government laws and regulations concerning the environment and health and safety matters. We do not believe that future compliance with government laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition. 
 As to environmental matters, our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, the protection of the environment, the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials and numerous other environmental laws and regulations. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to periodic environmental inspections and monitoring by various governmental agencies. In addition, certain of our production facilities require environmental permits that are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. As of the date of filing this Form 10-K, and based on current information, we believe that the probable costs of the remediation of company-owned property will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that we have adequately reserved for our liability for these matters as of October 31, 2023. 
 As to health and safety matters, our manufacturing operations involve the use of heavy equipment, machinery and chemicals and require the performance of activities that create safety exposures. We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to occupational health and safety. We have established safety policies, programs, procedures and training for our manufacturing operations, and our safety programs include measures required for compliance with these government laws and regulations. In addition, our safety programs include the ongoing identification and elimination of workplace exposures that can lead to injuries and sharing of health and safety best practices.

 We do not believe that future compliance with health and safety laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial condition. 
 We do not believe that compliance with federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has had or will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures related to environmental control in 2024. 
 See also Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information concerning environmental expenses and cash expenditures for the years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, and our reserves for environmental liabilities as of October 31, 2023 and 2022. 
 Human Capital 
 Our Company s values and culture are critical to our ability to attract, hire and retain talented employees for our global businesses. We seek to engage, develop and incentivize our employees to pursue our vision: Be the best performing customer service company in the world. We depend on our employees to provide differentiated customer service and create value for our customers through a solutions-based approach with the goal of earning our customers trust and loyalty. We work to accomplish this goal by looking to our purpose, We create packaging solutions for life s essentials, vision and values set forth in The Greif Way. 
 Our Build to Last strategy provides a platform to support our strategic growth and development under four key missions: creating thriving communities; delivering legendary customer service; protecting our future; and ensuring financial strength. Each employee has a part in driving these key missions wherever they are located in the world, and ultimately, our success is dependent on all of our employees working together to keep these priorities at the forefront of their activities. Within our creating thriving communities mission, we are focused on establishing a foundation for action that supports health and safety; diversity, equity and inclusion; and talent development and engagement. 
 Health and Safety 
 Safeguarding the health and safety of our employees is our first and foremost priority. We are committed to providing a safe working environment for all our employees with a philosophy of Zero Harm. We have implemented an incident tracking system that we call the LIFE program to assist with identifying global and regional leading indicators that facilitate the creation of programs and safety action plans that may help to reduce conditions and behaviors that lead to at-risk situations and the use of technology and automation to eliminate such conditions. We utilize a global safety scorecard with standardized safety metrics globally to understand, improve and correct safety risk and culture. To promote a continuous focus on safety, we have safety committees that consist of employees and management at all our facilities. We have implemented safety meetings at all levels in the organization from CEO to shop floor, both in the facilities and in office or remote locations creating a safety mindset that everyone is a safety leader regardless of their position, so that our safety culture is understood and practiced every day while developing a behavior commitment culture for each and every employee. We are steadfast in our commitment to employee safety. For example, we hold an annual global safety week focused on Zero Harm by sharing best practices and learnings to mitigate safety risks through interactive activities related to machine safety devices, good housekeeping and safe equipment operations. In addition, we have regular safety communications that target all employees, and we have an annual award that recognizes facilities that have achieved certain criteria for proactive actions and behaviors. 
 We are also committed to the total well-being of all our employees and their families with a variety of physical, mental and social wellness programs. These programs differ by region and include Company-sponsored or subsidized health care insurances, voluntary health fairs and employee assistance programs to improve mental health and wellness. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 In accordance with our values, we encourage our employees to embrace diversity of culture, language, location and thought. Our success depends on maintaining a culture where every employee communicates with respect, candor and trust. We rely on the unique qualities and talents of our employees to help us achieve our Build to Last strategy. We strive to create an inclusive, equitable and diverse working environment by supporting programs and trainings that foster gender and ethnic diversity as well as promoting equitable treatment within our workforce, including the support of multiple colleague-led resource groups, fostering an environment where our employees feel valued and appreciated for the distinct voice they bring to our Company. In addition, we strive to compensate our employees fairly and equitably and continue to monitor pay equity data and educate our managers to make objective compensation decisions in line with our Company s compensation policies. Our efforts to continue

 to grow our global diversity, equity and inclusion programs and to increase diversity within our Company is a top organizational priority. 
 Talent Development 
 Attracting, developing and retaining talented employees is an integral aspect of our human capital strategy and critical to our success. We continuously strive to create learning and development opportunities for all our employees. Our development and training programs are designed to enhance leadership, develop a customer service mindset and improve engagement at all levels within our organization. We utilize Greif University, a centralized training platform offering a variety of learning and development offerings, including recorded internal trainings, on-demand courses, assessments and a learning library. Greif University allows employees to access LinkedIn Learning, an online learning and skill building platform that empowers employees to develop skills to grow their career. We have a performance development review and talent development process in which managers provide regular feedback and coaching to assist with the development of our employees, including the use of individual development plans to assist with career development. To foster employee engagement, we encourage and value feedback from our employees and conduct annual engagement surveys of all our global employees to better understand our employee s level of engagement and identify areas of improvement to build high performing teams to meet our strategic goals.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our operating results to differ materially from those projected. The following factors, among others, in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, our actual financial or operational performance, or both. 
 Risks Related to Market and Economic Factors 
 Historically, our Business has been Sensitive to Changes in General Economic or Business Conditions. 
 Our customers generally consist of other manufacturers and suppliers who purchase industrial packaging products and containerboard and uncoated and coated recycled boxboard and related products for their own containment and shipping purposes. Because we supply a cross section of industries, such as chemicals, lubricants, films, paints and pigments, food and beverage, personal care, fragrances, petroleum, industrial coatings, carpeting, agriculture, agrochemical, pharmaceuticals, mineral products, packaging, automotive, construction and building products industries, and have operations in many countries, demand for our products and services has historically corresponded to changes in general economic and business conditions of the industries and countries in which we operate. The overall demand and prices for our products and services could decline as a result of numerous factors outside of our control, including an economic recession, increased labor costs, availability of and increased cost of energy, and disruptions in supply chains to our business, our customers, their end markets and our suppliers, changes in industrial production processes or consumer preference, changes in laws and regulations, inflation, tariffs, changes in published pricing indices, fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and changes in the fiscal or monetary policies of governments in the regions in which we operate. Accordingly, our financial performance is substantially dependent upon the general economic and business conditions existing in these industries and countries where we do business, and any prolonged or substantial economic downturn or geopolitical uncertainty in the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our Global Operations Subject us to Political Risks, Instability and Currency Exchange that Could Adversely Affect our Results of Operations. 
 We are a global company with operations in over 35 countries with approximately 36 of our fiscal 2023 sales derived from non-U.S. operations. Management of global operations is extremely complex, and our operations outside the United States are

 subject to additional risks that may not exist, or may not be as significant, with respect to our operations within the United States. 
 Within our global footprint, we have operations in Russia and Eastern and Western Europe. The length, impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly unpredictable. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has amplified, and may continue to amplify, certain risks to our operations, including increased foreign exchange volatility, disruptions to financial and credit markets, energy supply (specifically in Europe), supply chain disruptions, customer demand, increased risks of cybersecurity incidents, increased costs to ensure compliance with global and local laws and regulations, economic recessions in certain neighboring European countries or globally due to inflationary and other pressures, and delays in the ability, or even the inability, to access cash or earnings from Russia. In addition, the imposition of new or increased sanctions, tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine could negatively impact our business and operations. 
 Although we have been able to distribute some earnings from our Russian operations in compliance with all applicable laws, access to cash and earnings in Russia remains limited. Furthermore, in the event that our operations in Russia cease for any reason, that event would result in an impairment charge, as we would not likely generate a fair market return on those assets. We will continue to monitor the effects of this conflict, including risks that may affect our business, and we will adjust our plans accordingly as the situation progresses. Currently, the results of our operations related to Russia are not material to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 As a result of our general global operations, we are subject to certain risks that could disrupt our operations or force us to incur unanticipated costs or exit a specific country. These risks, which can vary substantially by country, may include economic or political instability, geopolitical events (such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas conflict and increasing tensions between China and Taiwan), corruption, social and ethnic unrest, the regulatory environment (including the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of legal requirements), hyperinflation and fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the U.S. dollar, repatriating cash from foreign countries to the U.S., downturns or changes in economic conditions (including in relation to commodity inflation), adverse tax consequences or rulings, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries, or regions impacting matters such as sustainability, environmental regulations and trade policies and agreements. 
 We also have indebtedness, agreements to purchase raw materials and agreements to sell finished products that are denominated in Euros, Turkish Lira, Russian Rubles and other currencies. Our operating performance is affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates by: 
 translations into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes of the assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. operations conducted in local currencies; and 
 gains or losses from transactions conducted in currencies other than the operation s functional currency. 
 The Current and Future Challenging Global Economy and Disruption and Volatility of the Financial and Credit Markets may Adversely Affect our Business. 
 Current global economic conditions are challenging to our global business operations. Such conditions have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our financial results. Future economic downturns, either in the United States, Europe or in other regions in which we do business could negatively affect our business and results of operations. With the volatility in the current global economic climate, inflation and geopolitical events around the world, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict, it is difficult for us to predict the complete impact of the forgoing matters on our business and results of operations. Due to these current and future economic conditions, our customers may face financial difficulties, disruption in their supply chains and the unavailability of or reduction in commercial credit or increased debt levels that may result in decreased sales by and revenues to our Company. Certain of our customers may cease operations or seek bankruptcy protection, which would reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our results of operations. Our customers that are financially viable and not experiencing economic distress may nevertheless elect to reduce the volume of orders for our products or close facilities in an effort to remain financially stable or as a result of the unavailability of commercial credit which would negatively affect our results of operations. We may experience difficulties in servicing, renewing or repaying our outstanding debt due to continued volatility in the global economy. We may also have difficulty accessing the global credit markets if there is a tightening of commercial credit availability, which would result in decreased ability to fund capital-intensive strategic projects. 
 Further, we may experience challenges in forecasting revenues and operating results due to these global economic conditions. The difficulty in forecasting revenues and operating results may result in volatility in the market price of our common stock.

 In addition, the lenders under our senior secured credit agreement and other borrowing facilities described in Item 7 of this Form 10-K under Liquidity and Capital Resources - Borrowing Arrangements and the counterparties with whom we maintain interest rate swap agreements, currency forward contracts and derivatives and other hedge agreements may be unable to perform their lending or payment obligations in whole or in part, or may cease operations or seek bankruptcy protection, which would negatively affect our cash flows and our results of operations. 
 The equipment that we use in our manufacturing operations is expensive and requires continued maintenance. We may require significant capital investment to maintain our equipment. If our existing sources of capital prove insufficient, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain capital to finance these expenditures on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability by us to maintain our equipment as needed or any inability to obtain capital for expenditures on equipment maintenance on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Industry Conditions 
 The Continuing Consolidation of our Customer Base and Suppliers may Intensify Pricing Pressure. 
 Over the last few years, many of our large industrial packaging, containerboard and coated and uncoated recycled boxboard and related products customers have acquired, or been acquired by, companies with similar or complementary product lines. In addition, many of our suppliers of raw materials such as steel, resin and paper, have undergone a similar process of consolidation. This consolidation has increased the concentration of our largest customers, resulting in, in some cases, increased pricing pressures from our customers, and in other cases, a decreasing customer base due to customers becoming more vertically integrated. The consolidation of our largest suppliers has resulted in limited sources of supply and increased cost pressures from our suppliers. Any future consolidation of our customer base or our suppliers could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, if one or more of our major customers reduces, delays or cancels substantial orders, if one or more of our major suppliers is unable to timely produce and deliver our orders, or if we are unable to broaden our customer base and increase specialty product offerings to offset the effects of consolidation, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected, particularly for the period in which the reduction, delay or cancellation occurs and also possibly for subsequent periods. 
 We Operate in Highly Competitive Industries. 
 Each of our operating segments operates in highly competitive industries. The most important competitive factors we face are price, quality, customer service and on-time delivery. To the extent any of our competitors become more successful with respect to any of these key competitive factors, we could lose customers and our sales could decline. Moreover, we anticipate that the lower customer demand patterns that we experienced throughout fiscal year 2023 will continue on an overall basis through 2024, which may cause our competitors to reduce prices to maintain or increase their sales volumes, which could adversely impact our sales volumes and our margins. In addition, due to the tendency of certain customers to diversify their suppliers, we could be unable to increase or maintain sales volumes with particular customers. Certain of our competitors are substantially larger and have significantly greater financial resources. 
 In addition, some of our products are made from raw materials that are subject to pronounced and at times, rapid price fluctuations, such as steel, which is used in the manufacture of steel drums and containers, old corrugated containers OCC ), which impacts our paper products, and oil, which in turn affects the price of resin for plastic drums and containers. Particularly in well-developed markets in Europe and in the United States, any substantial increases in the supply of industrial packaging resulting from capacity increases, the stockpiling of raw materials or other types of opportunistic behavior by our competitors in a period of high raw materials prices, or price wars, could adversely affect our margins and the profitability of our business. With many of our customers, we have implemented raw material price adjustment mechanisms based on industrial index pricing, however these price adjustment mechanisms lag market price changes and our ability to pass through costs to our customers could take months to realize which in turn could adversely impact our product margins. Although price is a significant basis of competition in our industry, we also compete on the basis of product reliability, the ability to deliver products on a global scale and our reputation for quality and customer service. If we fail to maintain our current standards for product quality, the scope of our distribution capabilities or our customer relationships, our reputation and business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 Negative media reports about us or our businesses, whether accurate or inaccurate, could damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and suppliers, cause customers and suppliers to terminate their relationship with us, or impair our ability to effectively compete, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 Our Business is Sensitive to Changes in Industry Demands and Customer Preferences. 
 Industry demand for certain of our industrial packaging and paper products in our United States operations, and industrial packaging products in European and other international markets has varied in recent years, and more recently related to inflationary pressures, causing competitive pricing for those products. In addition, disruptions within our customer labor supply could reduce customer demand and negatively impact our business. As demand decreases, we see an increase in competition on price, which could consequentially impact our sales and margins. We see to offset the impacts of these pressures by focusing on quality and customer service. 
 We compete in industries that are capital intensive, which generally leads to continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover marginal costs. We are making significant capital investments in line with our long-term business strategy, such as investments in new and improved equipment automation and technology to increase capacity, productivity and safety. As a result, changes in industry demands (including any resulting industry over-capacity) and increased new capacity for production of industrial packaging products by competitors, may cause substantial price competition and, in turn, we may not be able to derive the expected return on investment from our strategic investments which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, customer preferences are constantly changing based on, among other factors, cost, convenience, health, environmental and social concerns, and customers may choose to use different packaging products than the products we manufacture as their business models change, or may choose to use alternative, more sustainable materials for their packaging products, or simply forego the packaging of certain products entirely. For example, in the United States, sales of fibre drums continue to decline on a year over year basis as some customers select other packaging solutions for their products. Any shift away from packaging products we manufacture or changes in customer preferences to more sustainable supply chain solutions may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Raw Material Shortages, Price Fluctuations, Global Supply Chain Disruptions and High Inflation may Adversely Impact our Results of Operations. 
 The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are steel, resin, pulpwood, recycled pulp from OCC and recycled coated and uncoated boxboard and containerboard and used industrial packaging for reconditioning, which we purchase or otherwise acquire in highly competitive, price sensitive markets. We have long-term supply contracts in place for obtaining a portion of our principal raw materials. These raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. In addition, we manufacture certain component parts for our rigid industrial packaging products and those of some of our competitors. Some of these materials and component parts have been, and in the future may be, in short supply. For example, the availability of these raw materials and component parts and/or our ability to purchase and transport these raw materials and produce and transport these component parts may be unexpectedly disrupted by adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, man-made disasters, geopolitical conflicts, a substantial economic downturn in the industries that provide any of those raw material requirements, or competition for use of raw materials and component parts in other regions or countries. As a result of inflation and continued economic slowdown, we may continue to incur significant raw material prices increases in the future which would likely have an adverse effect on our operating margins. While we have taken steps to minimize the impact of these increased costs by working closely with our suppliers and customers, there can be no assurances that unforeseen future events in the global supply chain, and our ability to pass on inflationary costs on to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The disruptions to the global economy starting in 2020 and continuing throughout 2023, which were intensified by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have impeded global supply chains in some regions in which we operate more than others, resulting in longer lead times. 
 Energy and Transportation Price Fluctuations and Shortages may Adversely Impact our Manufacturing Operations and Costs. 
 The cost of producing our products is sensitive to the price of energy, including its impact on transport costs. Energy prices, in particular oil and natural gas, have fluctuated in recent years, and specifically in Europe related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which had a corresponding effect on our operation and production costs and may have the same effect on our customers causing volatility in demand for our products and services. We are currently seeking alternative energy resources in Europe that may take years to fully implement and savings to be realized, if any. Potential legislation, regulatory action and international treaties related to climate change, especially those related to the regulation of greenhouse gases, may result in significant increases in energy costs as well as taxes, and other governmental charges. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup any past or future increases in the cost of energy and transportation.

 Risks Related to our Operations 
 We may Encounter Difficulties or Liabilities Arising from Acquisitions or Divestitures. 
 We have invested a substantial amount of capital in acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments and we expect that we will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. We are continually evaluating acquisitions, divestitures and strategic investments that are significant to our business both in the United States and internationally. Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments involve numerous risks, including the failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions on acceptable terms and conditions, retain key customers, employees and contracts, the inability to integrate businesses without material disruption, unanticipated costs incurred in connection with integrating businesses, the incurrence of liabilities greater than anticipated or operating results that are less than anticipated, the inability to realize the projected value, and the inability to realize projected synergies. In addition, acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments and associated integration activities require time and attention of management and other key personnel. There can be no assurance that any acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments will be successfully integrated into our operations, that competition for acquisitions will not intensify or that we will be able to complete such acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments on acceptable terms and conditions. The costs of unsuccessful acquisition, joint venture and strategic investment efforts may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Additionally, in connection with any acquisitions or divestitures, we may become subject to contingent liabilities or legal claims, including but not limited to third party liability and other tort claims; claims for breach of contract; employment-related claims; environmental, health and safety liabilities; permitting, regulatory or other legal compliance issues; or tax liabilities. If we become subject to any of these liabilities or claims, and they are not adequately covered by insurance or an enforceable indemnity or similar agreement from a creditworthy counterparty, we may be responsible for significant out-of-pocket expenditures. These liabilities, if they materialize, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We may Incur Additional Rationalization Costs and there is no Guarantee that our Efforts to Reduce Costs will be Successful. 
 We have reorganized portions of our operations from time to time in recent years, particularly following acquisitions or divestments of businesses, and periods of economic downturn due to local, regional or global economic conditions. We will continue to implement continuous improvement initiatives necessary or desirable to improve our business portfolio, address underperforming assets and generate additional cash. These initiatives may include reductions in selling, general and administrative costs throughout our Company and have and will likely continue to result in the rationalization of manufacturing facilities. 
 The rationalization of our manufacturing facilities may result in temporary constraints upon our ability to manufacture the quantity of products necessary to fill orders and thereby complete sales in a timely manner. In addition, system upgrades at our manufacturing facilities that impact ordering, production scheduling and other related manufacturing processes are complex, and could impact or delay production targets. A prolonged delay in our ability to fill orders on a timely basis could affect customer demand for our products and increase the size of our product inventories, causing future reductions in our manufacturing schedules and adversely affecting our results of operations. Moreover, our continuous development and production of new products will often involve the retooling of existing manufacturing facilities. This retooling may limit our production capacity at certain times in the future, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the expansion and reconfiguration of existing manufacturing facilities could increase the risk of production delays, as well as require significant investments of capital. 
 While we expect these initiatives to result in significant profit opportunities and savings throughout our organization, our estimated profits and savings are based on assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, there can be no assurance that we will realize these profits and cost savings or that, if realized, these profits and cost savings will be sustained. Failure to achieve or delays in achieving projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from such measures, or unanticipated inefficiencies resulting from manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in progress or contemplated, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and harm our reputation. 
 Several Operations are Conducted by Joint Ventures that we Cannot Operate Solely for our Benefit. 
 Several operations, particularly in developing countries, are conducted through joint ventures. In countries that require us to conduct business through a joint venture with a local joint venture partner, the loss of a joint venture partner or a joint venture partner s loss of its ability to conduct business in such country may impact our ability to conduct business in that country. 
 12 

Table of Contents 

 Sanctions that apply to a partner of a joint venture or to a joint venture s directors or officers could also impact our ability to conduct business through that joint venture. 
 In joint ventures, we share ownership with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. In general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information, accounting and making decisions. In certain cases, our joint venture partners must agree in order for the applicable joint venture to take certain actions, including acquisitions, the sale of assets, borrowing money and granting liens on joint venture property. Our inability to take unilateral action that we believe is in our best interest may have an adverse effect on the financial performance of the joint venture and the return on our investment. Finally, we may be required on a legal or practical basis or both, to accept liability for obligations of a joint venture beyond our economic interest, including in cases where our co-owner becomes bankrupt or is otherwise unable to meet its commitments. 
 Certain of the Agreements that Govern our Joint Ventures Provide our Partners With Put or Call Options. 
 The agreements that govern certain of our current joint ventures under certain circumstances provide the joint venture partner with the right to sell their participation in the joint venture to us or the right to acquire our participation in the joint venture. Some of the joint venture agreements provide that the joint venture partner can sell its participation for a certain purchase price calculated on the basis of a fixed multiple. Such put and call rights may result in financial risks for us. In addition, such rights could negatively impact our operations if as a result of their exercise we lose access to members of our management teams that are familiar with local markets or distribution and manufacturing channels. 
 Our Ability to Attract, Develop and Retain Talented and Qualified Employees, Managers and Executives is Critical to our Success. 
 Our ability to attract, develop and retain talented and qualified employees at all levels within our organization, including production employees, key managers and executives is critical to the success of our business. We need an engaged workforce to serve our customers and meet our business objectives. Competitive pressures and a tightened labor market within and outside our industry, may make it more difficult and expensive to attract, hire and effectively onboard qualified employees. Increased turnover of production employees, the retirement of or unforeseen loss of key officers and employees without appropriate succession planning or the ability to develop or hire replacements could make it difficult to manage our business and meet our business objectives, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our Business may be Adversely Impacted by Work Stoppages and Other Labor Relations Matters. 
 We are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters, with approximately 27 of our employees around the world represented by unions. We have experienced work stoppages and strikes in the past, and there may be work stoppages and strikes in the future. Any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal manufacturing facilities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements, we may not reach new agreements without union action and any such new agreements may not be on terms satisfactory to us. 
 We may be Subject to Losses that Might not be Covered in Whole or in Part by Existing Insurance Reserves or Insurance Coverage and General Insurance Premium and Deductible Increases. 
 We are self-insured or carry large deductibles for certain types of insurance claims, which includes, but is not limited to, claims made under our employee medical and dental insurance programs and workers compensation, auto and general liability claims. We utilize outside actuarial services to establish reserves for estimated costs related to pending claims, administrative fees and claims incurred but not reported. Because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, currently established reserves may not be adequate to cover the actual liability for claims made under our employee medical and dental insurance programs and for certain of our workers compensation and liability claims. If it is concluded that our estimates are incorrect and our reserves are inadequate for these claims, we will need to increase our reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We have comprehensive liability, fire and extended coverage insurance on our facilities and operations, with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. However, there are certain types of losses, such as losses resulting from wars, acts of terrorism, windstorms, floods, wildfires, earthquakes or other natural disasters, or pollution, that may be uninsurable or subject to restrictive policy conditions or subject to very large deductibles. In these instances, should a loss occur in excess of insured limits, we could lose capital invested in that property, as well as the anticipated future revenues 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 derived from the manufacturing activities conducted at that property, while remaining obligated for any financial obligations related to the property. Any such loss would adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We purchase insurance policies covering general liability and product liability with substantial policy limits. However, there can be no assurance that any liability claim would be adequately covered by our applicable insurance policies or would not be excluded from coverage based on the terms and conditions of the policy. This could also apply to any applicable contractual indemnity. We also purchase environmental liability policies where legally required and may elect to purchase coverage in other circumstances in order to transfer all or a portion of environmental liability risk through insurance. However, there can be no assurance that any environmental liability claim would be adequately covered by our applicable insurance policies or would not be excluded from coverage based on the terms and conditions of the policy. We do not purchase crop insurance for our timberland holdings, and a forest fire or other event could damage a material amount of timber. 
 The costs of insurance coverage continue to increase, along with increases in the level of deductibles, and the availability of some insurance coverages is decreasing due to extensive property damage caused by natural disasters, increased cyber security breaches, large jury verdicts and other business and employment litigation and losses. Any substantial increases in our insurance premiums, deductibles or the availability of insurance policies could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our Business Depends on the Uninterrupted Operations of our Facilities, Systems and Business Functions, Including our Information Technology IT and Other Business Systems. 
 Our business is dependent upon our ability to execute, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as accessing key business data, financial information, order processing, invoicing and the operation of IT dependent manufacturing equipment. A significant portion of the communication between our employees, customers and suppliers around the world depends on the reliability of our IT systems. A significant interruption or major failure of the Internet, a shut-down of or inability to access one or more of our facilities, a power outage, unavailability or a failure of one or more of our IT, telecommunications or other systems would substantially impair our ability to perform daily functions on a timely basis and could result in a material adverse impact on our operations and adversely affect our sales. 
 We have established a business continuity plan in an effort to ensure the continuation of core business operations in the event that normal operations could not be performed due to a catastrophic event. While we continue to test and assess our business continuity plan to ensure it meets the needs of our core business operations and addresses multiple business interruption events, there is no assurance that core business operations could be performed upon the occurrence of such an event which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 A Cyber-Attack, Security Breach of Customer, Employee, Supplier or Company Information and Data Privacy Risks and Costs of Compliance with New Regulations may have a Material Adverse Effect on our Business, Financial Condition, Results of Operations and Cash Flows. 
 In the conduct of our business, we rely extensively on computer systems, including third-party systems, to collect, use, transmit, store and report data on information systems and interact with customers, vendors and employees. Increased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime and increased ransomware attacks pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and third-party systems and networks with our data (including employee and customer data), and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches caused by employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions, and heightened focus since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Any such threat could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. A security breach of our computer systems or third-party systems with our data could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation, or both. In addition, we could be subject to legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties if confidential information relating to customers, suppliers, employees or other parties is misappropriated from our computer system or third-party systems with our data. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these threats. However, we cannot ensure that our security efforts will prevent unauthorized access or loss of functionality to our or our third-party providers systems. 
 The regulatory framework for privacy issues continues to evolve worldwide with increased regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the U.S. and abroad, and an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data protection laws, regulations or other data protection standards in the countries in which we do business may expose us to litigation (including in some instances, class action litigation), fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could harm our business reputation, and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The data privacy landscape is continuously expanding and has significantly increased responsibilities for companies collecting, using and processing personal data, as well as significantly increased penalties for noncompliance of security and data breach obligations, 
 14

 specifically in the European Union EU under the General Data Protection Regulation, in China under the Personal Information Protection Law, and in Brazil under the General Personal Data Protection Law, in addition to U.S. privacy laws in numerous states. Many of these regulations are complex and their interpretation, application and enforcement are often uncertain. This regulatory and enforcement environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligations and risks to our business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens and enforcement risks and could result in substantial costs and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Risks Related to Financial Reporting 
 We Could be Subject to Changes in our Tax Rates, the Adoption of New U.S. or Foreign Tax Legislation or Exposure to Additional Tax Liabilities. 
 The multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has issued proposed guidance which establishes a 15 global minimum tax Pillar Two tax ). In December 2022, the EU issued a directive requiring member states to enact a 15 minimum tax into their domestic laws effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023. We will continue to monitor the status of the Pillar Two tax implementation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Implementation of the Pillar Two tax by jurisdictions in different ways may cause increased complexities as to compliance and increased audit controversy with tax authorities over the application or interpretation of the applicable rules. 
 Tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. At this time, we believe we are properly reflecting the provision for taxes on income using all current enacted global tax laws in every jurisdiction in which we operate. However, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. 
 We have a Significant Amount of Goodwill and Long-lived Assets Which, if Impaired in the Future, Would Adversely Impact our Results of Operations. 
 At October 31, 2023, the carrying value of our goodwill was 1,693.0 million. We may be required to record future impairments of our long-lived assets as we continue to restructure our business. Decisions to sell or close plants could reduce the estimated useful life of an asset group or indicate that the fair value of the asset group is less than the carrying value. We may also experience declines in particular businesses due to competition or other outside forces indicating our long-lived assets are not recoverable. Any resulting impairments will impact net income in the period in which the triggering event, such as permanent or sustaining reduction in cash flows, occurs and could be significant, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Costs 
 Changing Climate, Global Climate Change Regulations and Greenhouse Gas Effects may Adversely Affect our Operations and Financial Performance. 
 There is continuing concern from members of the scientific community and the general public that emissions of greenhouse gases GHG and other human activities have or will cause significant changes in weather patterns and increase the frequency or severity of extreme weather events, including droughts, wildfires and flooding. These types of extreme weather events have and may continue to adversely impact us, our suppliers, our customers and their ability to purchase our products and our ability to timely receive appropriate raw materials to manufacture and transport our products on a timely basis. 
 We believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent and causes of climate change will continue, with new and more restrictive legislation regulations and focus on environmental, social and governance ESG initiatives that could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Foreign, federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies have enacted or proposed various legislative and regulatory measures relating to increased transparency and standardization of reporting related to factors that may include climate change, regulating GHG emissions, recycling of plastic materials, and energy policies, including waste tax, and other governmental charges and mandates. For instance, it is anticipated that the Securities and Exchange Commission will issue a climate change disclosure rule in 2024, which, if implemented as proposed, would significantly expand climate-related disclosure obligations. The State of California has enacted legislation that will require large U.S. companies doing business in California to make broad-based climate-related 
 15 

Table of Contents 

 disclosures starting as early as 2026, and other states are also considering new climate change disclosure requirements. In addition, the European Union Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive CSRD became effective in 2023. CSRD applies to both EU and non-EU in-scope entities and would require them to provide expansive disclosures on various sustainability topics. We are assessing our obligations under CSRD and expect that compliance could require substantial effort in the future. We will likely need to be prepared to contend with overlapping, yet distinct, climate-related disclosure requirements in multiple jurisdictions. The compliance with foreign, federal, state and local legislation and regulations concerning climate-related disclosures may result in our Company incurring additional costs and capital expenditures, and the failure to comply with such legislation and regulations could result in fines to our Company and could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change. 
 We, along with other companies in many business sectors, including our customers, are considering and implementing ESG and sustainability strategies, specifically ways to reduce GHG emissions. As a result, our customers may request that changes be made to our products or facilities, as well as other aspects of our production processes, that increase costs and may require the investment of capital. The failure to comply with these requests could adversely affect our relationships with some customers, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We may be Unable to Achieve Our Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Targets by 2030. 
 In April 2021, we announced a GHG emission reduction target to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 28 percent by 2030 as part of our ESG and sustainability strategy. Achievement of these targets depends on our execution of operational strategies relating to investments in energy efficient equipment and options to utilize other alternative energy sources. Execution of these strategies and achievements of our 2030 target is subject to risk and uncertainties, many of which are out of our control. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to our ability to execute our strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and expected timeframes; availability, use and success of on and off-site renewable energy; availability and cost of zero-emissions electric equipment and vehicles; outcome of research efforts and future technology developments such as growing our post-consumer resin product offerings and downgauging our current portfolio; availability of purchasing high quality recycled materials; growing our life cycle services network; the increased cost and availability of virtual power purchase agreements; and the long timeline to complete certain sustainability projects. There are no assurances that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve our 2030 targets. Failure to achieve our targets could damage our reputation, customer and investor relationships or our access to financing. Further, given investors increased focus related to environmental, social and governance matters, such a failure could cause stockholders to reduce their ownership holdings, all of which, in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and reduce our stock price. 
 Legislation/Regulation Related to Environmental and Health and Safety Matters Could Negatively Impact our Operations and Financial Performance. 
 We must comply with extensive laws, rules and regulations in the United States and in each of the countries where we conduct business regarding environmental matters, such as air, soil and water quality and waste disposal. We must also comply with extensive laws, rules and regulations regarding safety, health and corporate social responsibility matters. There can be no assurance that compliance with existing and new laws, rules and regulations will not require significant expenditures. 
 In addition, laws, rules and regulations, as well as the interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations by governmental agencies, can change and restrict or prohibit the manner in which we conduct our current operations, require additional permits to engage in some or all of our current operations, or increase the cost of some or all our operations. For example, the U.S. EPA has indicated potential forthcoming changes to the regulatory framework that may impact our reconditioning business requiring a change to our processes and operations going forward. Such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We are also subject to transportation safety regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation DOT and agencies in other jurisdictions. Both the DOT regulations and standards issued by the United Nations and adopted by various jurisdictions outside the United States set forth requirements related to the transportation of both hazardous and nonhazardous materials in some of our packaging products and subject our Company to random inspections and testing to ensure compliance. Failure to comply could result in fines to us and could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We are subject to laws, rules and regulations relating to certain raw materials used in our business or present in our products. For example, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances PFAS are a group of chemicals that have been manufactured and used in consumer and industrial products since the 1940 s. PFAS compounds do not easily degrade and have been shown to accumulate 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 over time in the environment. In the U.S., Europe and other countries where we operate, there is heightened governmental and regulatory scrutiny on PFAS usage in packaging products and its role in the contamination of soil, air and water. Governmental inquiries or requirements involving PFAS could lead to us incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil proceedings, including personal injury claims, class actions, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward. These laws, rules and regulations, as well as investigations and resulting claims by individuals and other businesses, could adversely affect our reputation with our customers generally, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 At the EU-level, many laws and regulations are designed to protect human health and the environment. For example, Directive 2004/35/EC concerns obligations to remedy damages to the environment, which could require us to remediate contamination identified at sites we own or use. Other EU regulations and directives limit pollution from industrial activities, reduce emissions to air, water and soil, protect water resources, reduce waste, promote recycling, reuse or reduction of materials used, achieving a circular economy, protect employee health and safety and regulate the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals. The European Commission published its Fit for 55 package in July 2021; a collection of new legislative proposals and amendments to existing rules aimed at implementing the EU s target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55 by 2030. In addition to existing green taxes on energy use, a new EU plastic tax has been introduced. Specifically, there is heightened focus and in some cases a requirement by customers and regulators to use Post-Consumer Resin ("PCR") to manufacture more sustainable packaging. If we are unable to effectively source PCR or innovate our current product offerings to meet this demand, this could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we are closely monitoring the discussions on the proposed EU Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation, which is currently being discussed by the European Parliament and Council with the intention to become law in 2024 and could potentially impose new requirements in terms of recycled content, recyclability and reuse for our products. Failure to comply with these and other laws, or a change in the applicable legal framework, for example the increased enforcement of environmental regulations in the U.S., Europe, China or other countries or customer requirements, could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, in addition to those of our customers. 
 Our customers in the food and pharmaceutical industry are subject to increasing laws, rules and regulations relating to safety. As a result, customers may demand that changes be made to our products or facilities, as well as other aspects of our production processes, that may require the investment of capital. The failure to comply with these requests could adversely affect our relationships with some customers and result in negative effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Product Liability Claims and Other Legal Proceedings Could Adversely Affect our Operations and Financial Performance. 
 We produce products and provide services related to other parties products, including sensitive products such as food ingredients, pharmaceutical ingredients and hazardous substances. Incidents involving these product types can involve risk of recall, contamination, spillage, leakage, fires, and explosions, which can threaten individual health, impact the environment and cause the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and the performance of facilities below expected levels of capacity. If any of our customers have such incidents involving our products, they may bring product liability claims against us. While we have built extensive operational processes to ensure that the design and manufacture of our products meet rigorous quality standards, there can be no assurance that we or our customers will not experience operational process failures that could result in potential product, safety, regulatory or environmental claims and associated litigation. We are also subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in our areas of operation around the globe. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management s attention and resources. In accordance with customary practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims. In the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium and deductible levels at all. In addition, the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. If any significant judgment or claim is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We may Incur Fines or Penalties, Damage to our Reputation or other Adverse Consequences if our Employees, Agents or Business Partners Violate, or are Alleged to have Violated, Anti-bribery, Competition or Other Laws. 
 We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and non-U.S. laws, including anti-bribery, competition, trade sanctions and regulation, and other laws. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries, and could damage our reputation. Even the allegation or appearance of our employees, agents or business partners acting improperly or illegally could damage our reputation and result in significant expenditures in investigating and responding to such actions.

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are not a party to any pending legal proceedings that are material to our business or financial condition. 
 From time to time, we have been a party to legal proceedings arising at the country, state or local level involving environmental sites to which we have shipped, directly or indirectly, small amounts of toxic waste, such as paint solvents. As of the filing date of this Form 10-K, we have been classified only as a de minimis participant in such proceedings. We are not a party to any legal proceedings involving a governmental authority and arising under any federal, state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment and involving potential monetary sanctions in excess of 300,000, other than described below. 
 As previously reported under Item 3 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, in November 2022, Container Life Cycle Management LLC, our U.S. reconditioning joint venture CLCM ), reached agreement

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The terms Greif, the Company, we, us and our as used in this discussion refer to Greif, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements, in accordance with these principles, require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Historical revenues and earnings may or may not be representative of future operating results due to various economic and other factors. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used throughout the following discussion of our results of operations, both for our consolidated and segment results. For our consolidated results, EBITDA is defined as net income, plus interest expense, net, plus debt extinguishment charges, plus income tax expense, plus depreciation, depletion and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus restructuring charges, plus timberland gains, net, plus acquisition and integration related costs, plus non-cash asset impairment charges, plus non-cash pension settlement (income) charges, plus incremental COVID-19 costs, net, plus (gain) loss on disposal of properties, plants, equipment and businesses, net. 
 Since we do not calculate net income by reportable segment, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by reportable segment are reconciled to operating profit by reportable segment. In that case, EBITDA is defined as operating profit by reportable segment less other (income) expense, net, less non-cash pension settlement (income) charges, less equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net of tax, plus depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for that reportable segment, and Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus restructuring charges, plus timberland gains, net, plus acquisition and integration related costs, plus non-cash asset impairment charges, plus non-cash pension settlement (income) charges, plus incremental COVID-19 costs, net, plus (gain) loss on disposal of properties, plants, equipment and businesses, net, for that reportable segment. 
 We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as financial measures to evaluate our historical and ongoing operations and believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to enable investors to perform meaningful comparisons of our historical and current performance. The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement and should be read together with our financial results. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative or substitute for, and should not be considered superior to, our reported financial results. Accordingly, users of this financial information should not place undue reliance on the non-GAAP financial measures.

 Year 2023 Compared to Year 2022 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales were 5,218.6 million for 2023 compared with 6,349.5 million for 2022. The 1,130.9 million decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices and lower volumes across the Global Industrial Packaging segment and the Paper Packaging Services segment and the 148.8 million impact to net sales resulting from the sale of our approximately 50 equity interest in the Flexible Products Services business in the second quarter of 2022 (the FPS Divestiture ). See the Segment Review below for additional information on net sales by reportable segment. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit was 1,146.1 million for 2023 compared with 1,285.4 million for 2022. The 139.3 million decrease was primarily due to the same factors that impacted net sales, partially offset by lower raw material, transportation and manufacturing costs. See the Segment Review below for additional information on gross profit by reportable segment. Gross profit margin was 22.0 percent for 2023 compared to 20.2 percent for 2022. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses were 549.1 million for 2023 compared with 581.0 million for 2022. The 31.9 million decrease was primarily due to incentive compensation expense reduction. SG A expenses were 10.5 percent of net sales for 2023 compared with 9.2 percent of net sales for 2022. 
 Financial Measures 
 Operating profit was 605.5 million for 2023 compared with 621.2 million for 2022. Net income was 379.1 million for 2023 compared with 394.0 million for 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was 818.8 million for 2023 compared with 917.5 million for 2022. The reasons for changes in operating profit and Adjusted EBITDA for each reportable segment are described below in the Segment Review. 
 Trends 
 We anticipate that the lower customer demand patterns that we experienced throughout the 2023 fiscal year will continue into the 2024 fiscal year. Although we have seen some increase in demand for our containerboard products in the U.S. the past two months, we do not see that as an overall inflection point. 
 We expect the prices for steel, old corrugated containers, resin and other direct materials, as well as prices for transportation, labor and utilities, to remain relatively stable through the year. 
 We continue to actively monitor the impact and consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As of October 31, 2023, our operations in Russia account for approximately 4 percent of our net sales, approximately 9 percent of our operating profit and approximately 2 percent of our total assets. 
 The foregoing discussion of 2024 trends in our businesses does not consider the impact of our proposed acquisition of Ipackchem. See Item 1(g) of this Form 10-K, Recent Events - Proposed Acquisition of Ipackchem, for information concerning this proposed acquisition. 
 Segment Review 
 Global Industrial Packaging 
 Key factors influencing profitability in the Global Industrial Packaging reportable segment are: 
 Selling prices, product mix, customer demand and sales volumes; 
 Raw material costs, primarily steel, resin, containerboard and used industrial packaging for reconditioning; 
 Energy and transportation costs; 
 Benefits from executing the Greif Business System; 
 Restructuring charges; 
 Acquisition of businesses and facilities;

Table of Contents 

 Divestiture of businesses and facilities; and 
 Impact of foreign currency translation. 
 Net sales were 2,936.8 million for 2023 compared with 3,652.4 million for 2022. The 715.6 million decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower volumes, lower average selling prices as a result of contractual price adjustment mechanisms, the 148.8 million impact to net sales resulting from the FPS Divestiture and negative foreign currency translation impacts. 
 Gross profit was 634.4 million for 2023 compared with 692.6 million for 2022. The 58.2 million decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the same factors that impacted net sales, largely offset by lower raw material, transportation and manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin increased to 21.6 percent in 2023 from 19.0 percent in 2022. 
 Operating profit was 334.3 million for 2023 compared with 313.7 million for 2022. The 20.6 million increase was primarily due to the 62.4 million non-cash impairment charge during the first quarter of 2022 related to the FPS Divestiture, a 9.8 million gain recognized on our previously held minority ownership interest in Centurion and lower SG A expenses, partially offset by the same factors that impacted gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA was 423.7 million for 2023 compared with 458.2 million for 2022. The 34.5 million decrease was primarily due to the same factors that impacted gross profit, partially offset by lower SG A expenses. 
 Paper Packaging Services 
 Key factors influencing profitability in the Paper Packaging Services reportable segment are: 
 Selling prices, product mix, customer demand and sales volumes; 
 Raw material costs, primarily old corrugated containers; 
 Energy and transportation costs; 
 Benefits from executing the Greif Business System; 
 Restructuring charges; 
 Acquisition of businesses and facilities; and 
 Divestiture of businesses and facilities. 
 Net sales were 2,260.5 million for 2023 compared with 2,675.1 million for 2022. The 414.6 million decrease was primarily due to lower volumes and lower average selling prices due to lower published containerboard prices. 
 Gross profit was 502.5 million for 2023 compared with 584.5 million for 2022. The 82.0 million decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the same factors that impacted net sales, partially offset by lower old corrugated container and other raw material input costs, as well as lower transportation and labor costs. Gross profit margin increased to 22.2 percent in 2023 from 21.8 percent in 2022. 
 Operating profit was 264.1 million for 2023 compared with 298.5 million for 2022. The 34.4 million decrease in operating profit was primarily due to the same factors that impacted gross profit, partially offset by the 54.3 million gain from the divestiture of Tama Paperboard, LLC in the Paper Packaging Services segment (the Tama Divestiture during the first quarter of 2023 and lower SG A expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was 386.2 million for 2023 compared with 450.5 million for 2022. The 64.3 million decrease was primarily due to the same factors that impacted gross profit, partially offset by lower SG A expenses. 
 Land Management 
 As of October 31, 2023, our Land Management reportable segment consisted of approximately 175,000 acres of timber properties in the southeastern United States. Key factors influencing profitability in the Land Management reportable segment are: 
 Planned level of timber sales; 
 Selling prices and customer demand; 
 Gains on timberland sales; and 
 Gains on the disposal of development, surplus and HBU properties special use property ). 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 Net sales were 21.3 million for 2023 compared with 22.0 million for 2022. 
 Gross profit was 9.2 million for 2023 compared with 8.3 million for 2022. 
 Operating profit was 7.1 million for 2023 compared with 9.0 million for 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was 8.9 million for 2023 compared with 8.8 million for 2022. 
 In order to maximize the value of our timber properties, we continue to review our current portfolio and explore the development of certain of these properties. This process has led us to characterize our property as follows: 
 Surplus property, meaning land that cannot be efficiently or effectively managed by us, whether due to parcel size, lack of productivity, location, access limitations or for other reasons; 
 HBU property, meaning land that in its current state has a higher market value for uses other than growing and selling timber; 
 Development property, meaning HBU land that, with additional investment, may have a significantly higher market value than its HBU market value; and 
 Core timberland, meaning land that is best suited for growing and selling timber. 
 We report the sale of core timberland property in timberland gains, the sale of HBU and surplus property in gain on disposal of properties, plants and equipment, net and the sale of timber and development property under net sales and cost of products sold in our interim condensed consolidated statements of income. All HBU and development property, together with surplus property, is used to productively grow and sell timber until the property is sold. 
 Whether timberland has a higher value for uses other than growing and selling timber is a determination based upon several variables, such as proximity to population centers, anticipated population growth in the area, the topography of the land, aesthetic considerations, including access to lakes or rivers, the condition of the surrounding land, availability of utilities, markets for timber and economic considerations both nationally and locally. Given these considerations, the characterization of land is not a static process, but requires an ongoing review and re-characterization as circumstances change. 
 As of October 31, 2023, we estimated that there were 18,800 acres in the United States of special use property, which we expect will be available for sale in the next four to six years. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense for 2023 was 117.8 million on 494.7 million of pretax income and for 2022 was 137.1 million on 525.7 million of pretax income. The 19.3 million decrease in income tax expense for 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease in pre-tax earnings in 2023, as well as an increase in tax benefit of 5.4 million related to a net decrease in valuation allowances, including releases of valuation allowances. These reductions to income tax expense were offset by a decrease in tax benefit of uncertain tax position of 6.9 million, primarily driven by lapses in the statute of limitations. Additionally, in 2022 we recognized a net book loss of 58.6 million related to the FPS Divestiture and disposal of other businesses for which limited tax benefits were available.

 Year 2022 Compared to Year 2021 
 Results of our fiscal year 2022 compared to our fiscal year 2021 are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022, File No. 001-00566 (see Item 7 therein). 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are operating cash flows and borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and proceeds from our trade accounts receivable credit facilities. We use these sources to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, cash dividends, debt repayment and acquisitions. We anticipate continuing to fund these items in a like manner. We currently expect that operating cash flows, borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and proceeds from our trade accounts receivable credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital, capital expenditures, cash dividends, debt repayment, potential acquisitions of businesses and other liquidity needs for at least 12 months.

 2022 Credit Agreement 
 We and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to a senior secured credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. 
 The 2022 Credit Agreement provides for (a) an 800.0 million secured revolving credit facility, consisting of a 725.0 million multicurrency facility and a 75.0 million U.S. dollar facility, maturing on March 1, 2027, (b) a 1,100.0 million secured term loan A-1 facility with quarterly principal installments commencing on July 31, 2022 and continuing through January 31, 2027, with any outstanding principal balance of such term loan A-1 facility being due and payable on maturity on March 1, 2027 and (c) a 515.0 million secured term loan A-2 facility with quarterly principal installments commencing on July 31, 2022 and continuing through January 31, 2027, with any outstanding principal balance of such term loan A-2 being due and payable on maturity on March 1, 2027. 
 Interest is based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment or a base rate that resets periodically plus, in each case, a calculated margin amount that is based on our leverage ratio. Subject to the terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement, we have an option to add borrowings to the 2022 Credit Agreement with the agreement of the lenders. As of October 31, 2023, we had 722.7 million of available borrowing capacity under the 800.0 million secured revolving credit facility. 
 The repayment of all borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement is secured by a security interest in our personal property and the personal property of certain of our U.S. subsidiaries, including equipment and inventory and certain intangible assets, as well as a pledge of the capital stock of substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries, and is secured, in part, by the capital stock of the non-U.S. borrowers. However, in the event that we receive and maintain an investment grade rating from either Moody s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard Poor s Financial Services LLC, we may request the release of such collateral. 
 The 2022 Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, which include financial covenants that require us to maintain a certain leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. The leverage ratio generally requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter we will not permit the ratio of (a) our total consolidated indebtedness (less the aggregate amount of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents), to (b) our consolidated net income plus depreciation, depletion and amortization, interest expense (including capitalized interest), income taxes, and minus certain extraordinary gains and non-recurring gains (or plus certain extraordinary losses and non-recurring losses) and plus or minus certain other items for the preceding twelve months (as used in this paragraph only EBITDA to be greater than 4.00 to 1.00; provided that such leverage ratio is subject to (i) a covenant step-up (as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) increase adjustment of 0.50 upon the consummation of, and the following three fiscal quarters after, certain specified acquisitions, and (ii) a collateral release decrease adjustment of 0.25x during any collateral release period (as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement). The interest coverage ratio generally requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter we will not permit the ratio of (a) our consolidated EBITDA, to (b) our consolidated interest expense to the extent paid or payable, to be less than 3.00 to 1.00, during the applicable preceding twelve month period. As of October 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants and other agreements in the 2022 Credit Agreement.

 2023 Credit Agreement 
 On May 17, 2023, we and Greif Packaging LLC, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Greif, Inc. entered into a 300.0 million senior secured credit agreement (the 2023 Credit Agreement with CoBank, ACB CoBank ), who acted as lender and is acting as administrative agent of the 2023 Credit Agreement. The 2023 Credit Agreement is permitted incremental equivalent debt under the terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement. The 2023 Credit Agreement provides for a 300.0 million secured term loan facility with quarterly principal installments commencing on July 31, 2023 and continuing through January 31, 2028, with any outstanding principal balance of such term loan being due and payable on maturity on May 17, 2028. We used the borrowing under the 2023 Credit Agreement to repay and refinance a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement. Interest accruing under the 2023 Credit Agreement is based on SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment or a base rate that resets periodically plus, in each case, a calculated margin amount that is based on our leverage ratio. 
 The repayment of all borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement is secured by a security interest in certain of our personal property and certain of the personal property of certain of our U.S. subsidiaries, including equipment and inventory and certain intangible assets, as well as a pledge of the capital stock of substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries. However, in the event that we receive and maintain an investment grade rating from either Moody s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard Poor s Financial Services LLC, we may request the release of such collateral. Our obligations under the 2023 Credit Agreement are secured on a pari passu basis with the obligations arising under the 2022 Credit Agreement. 
 The 2023 Credit Agreement contains covenants, including financial covenants, substantially the same as the covenants in 2022 Credit Agreement, as described above, and a most favored lender provision related to the 2022 Credit Agreement. As of October 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants and other agreements in the 2023 Credit Agreement. 
 United States Trade Accounts Receivable Credit Facility 
 We have a 300.0 million U.S. Receivables Financing Facility Agreement (the U.S. RFA that matures on May 17, 2024. As of October 31, 2023, there was a 270.9 million outstanding balance under the U.S. RFA that is reported as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets because we intend to refinance these obligations on a long-term basis and have the intent and ability to consummate a long-term refinancing by renewing the existing agreement or entering into new financing arrangements. The U.S. RFA also contains events of default and covenants that are substantially the same as the covenants under the 2022 Credit Agreement. As of October 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants. Proceeds of the U.S. RFA are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
 International Trade Accounts Receivable Credit Facilities

 See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our financial obligations. 
 
 Financial Instruments 
 Interest Rate Derivatives 
 As of October 31, 2023, we have various interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 1,300.0 million, amortizing down over the term, in which we receive variable interest rate payments based on SOFR and in return are obligated to pay interest at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 2.62 . These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and will mature between March 11, 2024 and July 16, 2029. 
 We are actively monitoring the interest rate market and may execute new interest rate swaps as appropriate. Subsequent to October 31, 2023, we entered into additional interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 250.0 million maturing November 3, 2028, in which we receive variable rate interest payments based on SOFR and in return are obligated to pay interest at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 4.20 .

Table of Contents 

 Accordingly, the gain or loss on these derivative instruments are reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transactions and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 
 Foreign Exchange Hedges 
 We conduct business in international currencies and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates. Our objective is to reduce volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on business operations. Accordingly, we enter into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of certain existing foreign currency assets and liabilities, commitments and anticipated foreign currency cash flows. 
 As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts in the notional amount of 66.0 million and 132.1 million, respectively. 
 We are actively monitoring the foreign exchange hedges market and may execute new foreign currency forward contracts as appropriate. Subsequent to October 31, 2023, we entered into additional foreign currency forward contract in the notional amount of 268.0 million maturing February 29, 2024. 
 Cross Currency Swaps 
 We have operations and investments in various international locations and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates. We have cross currency interest rate swaps that synthetically swap 319.3 million of fixed rate debt to Euro denominated fixed rate debt. We receive a weighted average rate of 1.39 . These agreements are designated as either net investment hedges or cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and will mature between March 2, 2024 and October 5, 2026. 
 We are actively monitoring the cross currency interest rate swap market and may execute new cross currency interest rate swaps as appropriate. Subsequent to October 31, 2023, we entered into additional cross currency interest rate swaps that synthetically swap 213.2 million of fixed rate debt to Euro denominated fixed rate debt maturing November 3, 2028. We receive a weighted average rate of 1.31 on these swaps. 
 Accordingly, the gain or loss on the net investment hedge derivative instruments is included in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income until the net investment is sold, diluted or liquidated. The gain or loss on the cash flow hedge derivative instruments is included in the unrealized foreign exchange component of other expense, offset by the underlying gain or loss on the underlying cash flows that are being hedged. Interest payments received from the cross currency swap are excluded from the net investment hedge effectiveness assessment and are recorded in interest expense, net on the consolidated statements of income. 
 See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional disclosures regarding our financial instruments. 
 
 Other Liquidity Considerations 
 Post-Retirement Benefit Plans 
 We have no near-term post-retirement benefit plan funding obligations. We intend to make a post-retirement benefit plan contribution of 21.9 million during 2024, which we anticipate will consist of 16.2 million of employer contributions and 5.7 million of benefits paid directly by the employer. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our post-retirement benefit plans. 
 Contingent Liabilities and Environmental Reserves 
 Environmental reserves are estimates based on current remediation plans, and actual liabilities could significantly differ from the reserve estimates. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our contingent liabilities and environmental reserves. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 In June 2022, the Stock Repurchase Committee of our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 150.0 million of shares of our Class A or Class B Common Stock or any combination thereof. On June 23, 2022, we entered into a 75.0 million accelerated share repurchase agreement ASR with Bank of America, N.A. for the repurchase of shares

 of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, at that time we initiated a plan to repurchase an aggregate of 75.0 million of shares of our Class A or Class B Common Stock, or any combination thereof, in open market purchases OSR program (collectively, the Stock Repurchase Program ). 
 Under the ASR, on June 24, 2022, we made a payment of 75.0 million and received an initial delivery of approximately 80 of the expected share repurchases, or 1,021,451 shares of Class A Common Stock. On February 28, 2023, we received the remaining 94,259 shares of Class A Common Stock. 
 We began making repurchases of Class B Common Stock under the OSR program on September 9, 2022 and repurchases of Class A Common Stock under the OSR program on March 16, 2023 in accordance with Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The OSR program was completed on May 26, 2023, with 25.0 million of shares of Class A Common Stock, or 406,343 shares, and 50.0 million of shares of Class B Common Stock, or 676,598 shares, being repurchased under the OSR program. 
 See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding this program and the repurchase of shares of Class A and B Common Stock. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We believe that the consistent application of these policies enables us to provide readers of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about our results of operations and financial condition. The following are the accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial condition and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. 
 Other items that could have a significant impact on the financial statements include the risks and uncertainties listed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors. Actual results could differ materially using different estimates and assumptions, or if conditions are significantly different in the future. 
 Business Combinations 
 Under the acquisition method of accounting, we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration transferred to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition. The fair values assigned, defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants, are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management. The excess purchase consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets, net of liabilities assumed, is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. 
 Valuation of Goodwill 
 We account for goodwill in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. Under ASC 350, goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment either annually on August 1 or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Our goodwill impairment assessment is performed by reporting unit. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment (the component level) if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. However, components are aggregated as a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. In conducting the annual impairment tests, the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units is compared to its carrying amount including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount, then no impairment exists. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, we record an impairment of goodwill equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, not to exceed the recorded amount of goodwill. 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 The Global Industrial Packaging reportable segment consists of four operating segments: Global Industrial Packaging North America; Global Industrial Packaging Latin America; Global Industrial Packaging Europe, Middle East and Africa; Global Industrial Packaging Asia Pacific. Each of these operating segments also qualify as a component that has discrete financial information available that is reviewed by segment management on a regular basis. As such, these components also represent our reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. 
 The Paper Packaging Services reportable segment is also an operating segment. This operating segment consists of multiple components that have discrete financial information available that is reviewed by segment management on a regular basis. We have evaluated those components and concluded that they are economically similar and should be aggregated into single reporting unit. For the purpose of aggregating our components, we review the long-term performance of gross profit margin and operating profit margin. Additionally, we review qualitative factors such as common customers, similar products, similar manufacturing processes, sharing of resources, level of integration and interdependency of processes across components. We place greater weight on the qualitative factors outlined in ASC 280 Segment Reporting and consider the guidance in ASC 350 in determining whether two or more components of an operating segment are economically similar and can be aggregated into a single reporting unit. 
 The estimated fair value of the reporting units utilized in the impairment test is based on a discounted cash flow analysis or income approach and market multiple approach. Under this method, the principal valuation focus is on the reporting unit s cash-generating capabilities. The discount rates used for impairment testing are based on a market participant s weighted average cost of capital. The use of alternative estimates, peer groups or changes in the industry, or adjusting the discount rate, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, multiples or price earnings ratios used could affect the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in impairment. Any identified impairment would result in an adjustment to our results of operations. 
 In performing the test, we first evaluate qualitative factors, such as macroeconomic conditions and our overall financial performance to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We then evaluate how significant each of the identified factors could be to the fair value or carrying amount of a reporting unit and weigh those factors in totality in forming a conclusion of whether or not it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount (the Step 0 Test). If necessary, the next step in the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each of the reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss would be recognized (not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill). We did not utilize any Step 0 tests in 2023. 
 For all reporting units with goodwill balances, we proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment testing and the fair value exceeded carrying value by at least 31 , so no impairment was deemed to exist. Net sales, gross profit margin and operating expense forecasts, as well as the selection of discount rates, are the assumptions that are most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. In addition, certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in actual and expected consumption and demand, could result in changes to those assumptions and judgments. A revision of those assumptions could cause the fair value of the reporting unit to fall below its respective carrying value. If in future years, our reporting units actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill. 
 The following table summarizes the carrying amount of goodwill by reporting unit for the year ended October 31, 2023 and 2022: 
 Goodwill Balance (in millions) October 31, 2023 October 31, 2022 Global Industrial Packaging North America 461.6 286.0 Europe, Middle East and Africa 330.0 315.4 Asia Pacific 96.0 95.2 Paper Packaging Services 805.4 767.9 Total 1,693.0 1,464.5 The Global Industrial Packaging: Latin America and Land Management reporting units have no goodwill balance at either reporting period.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk related to our financial instruments that include borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement, the 2023 Credit Agreement and proceeds from U.S. RFA and the European RFA and cross currency and interest rate swap agreements. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The interest rate swap agreements have been entered into to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates. 
 We have various interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 1,300.0 million, maturing between March 11, 2024 and July 16, 2029. We receive variable interest rate payments based upon one-month U.S. dollar SOFR, and in return are obligated to pay interest at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 2.62 , plus a spread. 
 Gains (losses) reclassified to earnings under these interest rate swaps were recorded in the amount of 28.5 million, (8.4) million and (18.1) million for the years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 We have various cross currency interest rate swaps that synthetically swap 319.3 million of fixed rate debt to Euro denominated fixed rate debt. We receive a weighted average rate of 1.39 . These agreements are designated as either net investment hedges or cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and will mature between March 2, 2024 and October 5, 2026. 
 The gain or loss on the net investment hedge derivative instruments is included in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income until the net investment is sold, diluted, or liquidated. The gain or loss on the cash flow hedge derivative instruments is included in the unrealized foreign exchange component of other expense, offset by the underlying gain or loss on the underlying cash flows that are being hedged. Interest payments received from the cross currency swap are excluded from the net investment hedge effectiveness assessment and are recorded in interest expense, net on the consolidated statements of income. 
 Gains on the cross currency swap agreement was recorded in interest expense for the amount of 5.1 million, 5.8 million and 2.2 million for the years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Currency Risk 
 As a result of our international operations, our operating results are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The geographic presence of our operations mitigates this exposure to some degree. Additionally, our transaction exposure is somewhat limited because we produce and sell a majority of our products in local currency within most countries in which we operate. 
 As of October 31, 2023 and 2022 we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts in the notional amount of 66.0 million and 132.1 million, respectively. The purpose of these contracts is to hedge our exposure to foreign currency transactions and short-term intercompany loan balances in our international businesses. These contracts resulted in realized gains (losses) recorded in other expense, net of 1.2 million, (6.2) million and 0.4 million for the years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 A sensitivity analysis (with respect only to these instruments) to changes in the foreign currencies hedged indicates that if the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10 percent, the fair value of these instruments would increase by 0.5 million to a net asset of 0.5 million. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar weakened by 10 percent, the fair value of these instruments would decrease by 0.4 million to a net liability of 0.4 million. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We purchase commodities such as steel, resin, containerboard, pulpwood and energy. We do not currently engage in material hedging of these commodities.

 countries. 
 Due to the variety of its products, the Company has many customers buying different products and due to the scope of the Company s sales, no one customer is considered principal in the total operations of the Company. 
 The Company supplies a cross section of industries, such as chemicals, paints and pigments, food and beverage, petroleum, industrial coatings, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, minerals, packaging, automotive and building products, and makes spot deliveries on a day-to-day basis as its products are required by its customers. The Company does not operate on a backlog to any significant extent and maintains only limited levels of finished goods. Many customers place their orders weekly for delivery during the same week. 
 The Company s raw materials are principally steel, resin, containerboard, old corrugated containers, pulpwood, recycled coated and uncoated paperboard and used industrial packaging for reconditioning. 
 There were approximately full time employees of the Company as of October 31, 2023.

 million and million as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company recognizes allowances for bad debts based on the length of time receivables are past due with allowance percentages, based on its historical experiences, applied on a graduated scale relative to the age of the receivable amounts. If the Company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, the Company records a specific allowance for bad debts. Amounts deemed uncollectible are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. 
 . The Company did t incur any losses related to these investments during the years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. 
 Trade receivables can be potentially exposed to a concentration of credit risk with customers or in particular industries. Such credit risk is considered by management to be limited due to the Company s many customers, none of which are considered principal in the total operations of the Company, and its geographic scope of operations in a variety of industries throughout the world. The Company does not have an individual customer that exceeds 10 percent of total revenue. In addition, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial conditions and maintains reserves for credit losses. Such losses historically have been within management s expectations.

 Depreciation expense was million, million and million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When properties are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the asset and related allowance accounts. Gains or losses are credited or charged to income as incurred. 
 The Company capitalizes interest on long-term fixed asset projects using a rate that approximates the weighted average cost of borrowing. For the years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company s capitalized interest costs were not material. 
 The Company tests for impairment of properties, plants and equipment if certain indicators are present to suggest that impairment may exist. Long-lived assets are grouped together at the lowest level, generally at the plant level, for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other groups of long-lived assets. As events warrant, the Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, by assessing whether the carrying value can be recovered over their remaining useful lives through the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows of the underlying business. Future decisions to change the Company s manufacturing processes, exit certain businesses, reduce excess capacity, temporarily idle facilities and close facilities could also result in material impairment losses. Any impairment loss that may be required is determined by comparing the carrying value of the assets to their estimated fair value. 
 As of October 31, 2023, the Company s timber properties consisted of approximately acres, all of which were located in the southeastern United States. The Company s land costs are maintained by tract. Upon acquisition of a new timberland tract, the Company records separate amounts for land, merchantable timber and pre-merchantable timber allocated as a percentage of the values being purchased. The Company begins recording pre-merchantable timber costs at the time the site is prepared for planting. Costs capitalized during the establishment period include site preparation by aerial spray, costs of seedlings, including refrigeration rental and trucking, planting costs, herbaceous weed control, woody release and labor and machinery use. The Company does not capitalize interest costs in the process. Property taxes are expensed as incurred. New road construction costs are capitalized as land improvements and depreciated over a to year period. Road repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Costs after establishment of the seedlings, including management costs, pre-commercial thinning costs and fertilization costs, are expensed as incurred. Once the timber becomes merchantable, the cost is transferred from the pre-merchantable timber category to the merchantable timber category in the depletion block. 
 Merchantable timber costs are maintained by product classes: pine sawtimber, pine chip-n-saw, pine pulpwood, hardwood sawtimber and hardwood pulpwood, within a depletion block, with each depletion block based upon a geographic district or subdistrict. Currently, the Company has depletion blocks. These same depletion blocks are used for pre-merchantable timber costs. Each year, the Company estimates the volume of the Company s merchantable timber for the product classes by each depletion block and depletion costs recognized upon sales are calculated as volumes sold times the unit costs in the respective depletion block. For the years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company s depletion expense was not material.

 The Company reviews goodwill by reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as required by ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, either annually on August 1, or whenever events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment (the component level) if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. The components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent they share similar qualitative and quantitative characteristics. 
 The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of August 1, 2023. The fair value of the Company s goodwill reporting units exceeded the carrying value, resulting in no impairment. Discount rates, revenue growth rates and gross margins are the assumptions that are most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. In addition, certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in actual and expected consumption and demand, could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. A revision of these assumptions could cause the fair value of the reporting unit to fall below its respective carrying value. As for all of the Company s reporting units, if in future years, the reporting unit s actual results are not consistent with the Company s estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, the Company may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill.

 Expected Return on plan assets Rate of compensation increase 
 The discount rate is determined by developing a hypothetical portfolio of individual high-quality corporate bonds available at the measurement date, the coupon and principal payments of which would be sufficient to satisfy the plans expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligation. The discount rate by country is equivalent to the average yield on that hypothetical portfolio of bonds and is a reflection of current market settlement rates on such high quality bonds, government treasuries and annuity purchase rates. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the Company considers current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. In developing future return expectations for the defined benefit pension plans assets, the Company formulates views on the future economic environment, both in the U.S. and globally. The Company evaluates general market trends and historical relationships among a number of key variables that impact asset class returns, such as expected earnings growth, inflation, valuations, yields and spreads, using both internal and external sources. The Company takes into account expected volatility by asset class and diversification across classes to determine expected overall portfolio results given current and expected allocations. The Company uses published mortality tables for determining the expected lives of plan participants and believes that the tables selected are most-closely associated with the expected lives of plan participants as the tables are based on the country in which the participant is employed. 
 Based on the Company s analysis of future expectations of asset performance, past return results and its current and expected asset allocations, the Company has assumed a long-term expected return on those assets for cost recognition in 2023. For the defined benefit pension plans, the Company applies its expected rate of return to a market-related value of assets, which stabilizes variability in the amounts to which the Company applies that expected return. 
 The Company amortizes experience gains and losses as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions over a period no longer than the average future service of employees. 
 During the year ended October 31, 2023, plan assets of million were used to purchase million in annuity contracts and pay million in lump sums to retirees to settle the pension obligation and close the Canada pension plans.

 The Company combines lease and non-lease components for all leases, except real estate, for which these components are presented separately. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not capitalized and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The implicit rate is not readily determinable for substantially all of the Company s leases, therefore the initial present value of lease payments is calculated utilizing an estimated incremental borrowing rate determined at the portfolio level based on market and Company specific information. 
 Certain of the Company s leases include variable costs. As the right of use asset recorded on the balance sheet was determined based upon factors considered at the commencement date, changes in these variable expenses are not capitalized and are expensed as incurred throughout the lease term. 
 As of October 31, 2023, the Company had no significant leases that had not commenced.

 HBU property, meaning land that in its current state has a higher market value for uses other than growing and selling timber. 
 Development property, meaning HBU land that, with additional investment, may have a significantly higher market value than its HBU market value. 
 Timberland, meaning land that is best suited for growing and selling timber. 
 The disposal of surplus and HBU property is reported in the consolidated statements of income under gain on disposals of properties, plants and equipment, net and the sale of development property is reported under net sales and cost of products sold.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Greif, Inc. and subsidiary companies 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Greif, Inc. and subsidiary companies (the Company as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated December 18, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Goodwill - Global Industrial Packaging Asia Pacific Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 3 to the Financial Statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Descriptio n 
 The Company s evaluation of goodwill for impairment for the Global Industrial Packaging Asia Pacific GIP APAC reporting unit involves comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The Company s determination of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is based on both the market approach and a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing the income approach. The determination of the estimated fair value using the market approach and the discounted cash flow model requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to the valuation of the reporting unit. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The Company s consolidated goodwill balance was 1.7 billion as of October 31, 2023, of which 96 million was allocated to the GIP APAC reporting unit. The estimated fair value of the GIP APAC reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, therefore no impairment was recognized. 
 We identified the valuation of the GIP APAC reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value the GIP APAC reporting unit. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of 
 83 

Table of Contents 

 future net sales, gross profit margins and operating expenses as well as the selection of valuation multiples and discount rate, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to forecasts of future net sales, gross profit margins and operating expenses and the selection of the valuation multiples and discount rate for the GIP APAC reporting unit included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over management s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of the GIP APAC reporting unit, such as controls related to management s development of forecasts of future net sales, gross profit margins and operating expenses, and the selection of valuation multiples and discount rate. 
 We performed a sensitivity analysis of the forecasts of future net sales, gross profit margins, operating expenses and the discount rate, which included their impact on future cash flows. 
 We evaluated management s ability to accurately forecast net sales, gross profit margins, and operating expenses and evaluated the reasonableness of these assumptions by comparing management s forecast for historical periods to actual results for those periods. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of management s forecasts of future net sales and gross profit margins by comparing the forecasts to historical and forecasted information included in macroeconomic benchmarking reports. 
 With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the long-term revenue growth rate, the discount rate, and the valuation multiples by: 
 Testing the source information underlying the determination of long-term revenue growth rate, the discount rate, and the valuation multiples and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations. 
 Developing a range of independent estimates for the discount rate and valuation multiples and comparing the discount rate and valuation multiples selected by management to those ranges. 
 Comparing the long-term revenue growth rate to macroeconomic benchmarking.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We completed the Lee Container Acquisition on December 15, 2022 , the Centurion Acquisition on March 31, 2023, the ColePak Acquisition on August 23, 2023 and the Reliance Acquisition on October 1, 2023. The scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023, will not include the Lee Container Acquisition, the Centurion Acquisition, the ColePak Acquisition and the Reliance Acquisition. This exclusion is in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of assessment in the year of acquisition. 
 With the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report: 
 Information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission; 
 Information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is the process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to allow for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements; and 
 provide reasonable assurance as to the detection of fraud. 
 All internal control systems have inherent limitations, including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls, and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the designed control objectives. The Company s internal control system is supported by written policies and procedures, contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and is audited by the internal audit function. Appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified. As allowed by the Securities and Exchange Commission s general guidance, management excluded Lee Container, Centurion, ColePak, and Reliance, which were acquired in 2023, from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting. These acquisitions constituted approximately 13 of total assets and approximately 3 of net sales, included in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended October 31, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 As of October 31, 2023, management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. In making this assessment, we used the criteria described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2023. 
 Our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the shareholders and Board of Directors of Greif, Inc. and subsidiary companies 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Greif, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of October 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended October 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated December 18, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 As described in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Lee Container Corporation, Inc., Centurion Container LLC, ColePak, LLC, and Reliance Products Ltd., which were acquired on December 15, 2022, March 31, 2023, August 23, 2023, and October 1, 2023, respectively, and whose financial statements constitute approximately 13 of total assets and approximately 3 of total revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Lee Container Corporation, Inc., Centurion Container LLC, ColePak, LLC, and Reliance Products Ltd. and their subsidiaries. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

GREIF, INC. 

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY 

A. Introduction 
 
 The Board of Directors (the Board of Greif, Inc. (the Company is dedicated to maintaining and enhancing a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability. As a result, the Board has adopted this incentive compensation recovery policy (the Policy ), which provides for the recovery by the Company of incentive-based compensation received by Executive Officers under certain circumstances. 
 
 B. Purpose of Policy 
 
 The purpose of this Policy is to provide for the Company s recovery of erroneously awarded compensation received by Executive Officers. This Policy is intended to comply in all respects with Section 303A.14 of the New York Stock Exchange NYSE Listed Company Manual, as hereafter amended or modified Section 303A.14 
 
 C. Administration 
 
 The Board has determined that the Compensation Committee (the Committee of the Board is best suited to administer this Policy. The Committee is authorized, subject to the provisions of this Policy and Section 303A.14, to make such determinations and interpretations and to take such actions in connection with this Policy as it deems necessary or advisable. All determinations and interpretations made by the Committee or the Board in respect of the Policy will be final, binding, and conclusive. 
 
 D. Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation 
 
 The Company will recover reasonably promptly the amount of erroneously awarded compensation in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (in each case, an Accounting Restatement ). 
 
 This Policy applies to all incentive-based compensation received by a person 
 
 (a) After beginning service as an Executive Officer 
 
 (b) Who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for that incentive-based compensation 
 
 (c) While the Company has a class of securities listed on the NYSE and 
 
 (d) During the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date for which the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement. The Company s obligation to recover erroneously awarded compensation is not dependent on if or when the Company s restated financial statements are 
 1 

filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission ), but is based on the date or period in respect of which the Accounting Restatement is required. 
 
 (2) For purposes of determining the relevant recovery period, the date that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement is the earlier to occur of 
 
 (a) The date the Board, the Committee, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if action of the Board or the Committee is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement or 
 
 (b) The date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. 
 
 (3) The amount of incentive-based compensation that is subject to this Policy (the erroneously awarded compensation is the amount of incentive-based compensation received that exceeds the amount of incentive-based compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts and must be computed without regard to any taxes paid. For incentive-based compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of erroneously awarded compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement 
 
 (a) The amount must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the incentive-based compensation was received and 
 
 (b) The Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the NYSE. 
 
 (4) The Company shall recover erroneously awarded compensation in compliance with this Policy except to the extent that one of the three conditions set forth below are met, and the Committee has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable. 
 
 (a) The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of erroneously awarded compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to the NYSE. 
 
 (b) Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of erroneously awarded compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company must obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the NYSE, that recovery would result in such a violation, and must provide such opinion to the NYSE. 
 
 (c) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to 
 2 

fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. 
 
 (5) The Company shall be prohibited from indemnifying any current or former Executive Officer against the loss of erroneously awarded compensation. 
 
 E. Disclosure in Commission Filings 
 
 The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the Federal securities laws, including the disclosures required by the applicable Commission filings. 
 
 F. Exemptions from Policy 
 
 This Policy shall not apply to any securities specifically exempt from the requirements of Section 303A.14. 
 
 G. Definitions 
 
 For purposes of this Policy, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below 
 
 (1) Executive Officer . An Executive Officer is any one of the Company s Section 16 officers, as identified by the Board of Directors. 
 
 (2) Financial reporting measures . Financial reporting measures are measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock price and total shareholder return are also financial reporting measures. A financial reporting measure need not be presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the Commission. 
 
 (3) Incentive-based Compensation . Incentive-based compensation is any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure. For the avoidance of doubt, annual salary is not incentive- based compensation and is not subject to this Policy. 
 
 (4) Received . For purposes of this Policy, incentive-based compensation is deemed received in the Company s fiscal period during which the financial reporting measure specified in the incentive-based compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the incentive-based compensation occurs after the end of that period. 
 
 H. Amendment 
 
 Subject to the provisions of Section 303A.14, the Committee or Board may, from time to time, suspend, discontinue, revise, or amend this Policy in any respect whatsoever. 
 
 I. Other Recoupment Rights 
 
 This Policy shall be construed and interpreted to comply with Section 303A.14. Nothing in this Policy will be deemed to limit or restrict (a) the Company from seeking recoupment, repayment and or forfeiture of compensation (including incentive compensation) under circumstances not set forth in this Policy and against employees who are not covered by the 
 3 

Policy, including other disciplinary action, termination of employment, criminal action or other available remedies, or (b) the Committee s discretion in administering any incentive plans of the Company.
