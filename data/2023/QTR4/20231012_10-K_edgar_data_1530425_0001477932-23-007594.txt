In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may , will , should , could , expects , plans , intends , anticipates , believes , estimates , predicts , potential or continue or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about our market opportunity, our strategies, competition, expected activities and expenditures as we pursue our business plan, and the adequacy of our available cash resources. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Actual results may differ materially from the predictions discussed in these forward-looking statements. The economic environment within which we operate could materially affect our actual results. Additional factors that could materially affect these forward-looking statements and/or predictions include, among other things: the volatility of minerals prices, the possibility that exploration efforts will not yield economically recoverable quantities of minerals, accidents and other risks associated with mineral exploration and development operations, the risk that the Company will encounter unanticipated geological factors, the Company s need for and ability to obtain additional financing, the possibility that the Company may not be able to secure permitting and other governmental clearances necessary to carry out the Company s exploration and development plans, other factors over which we have little or no control; and other factors discussed in the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Our management has included projections and estimates in this Form 10-K, which are based primarily on management s experience in the industry, assessments of our results of operations, discussions and negotiations with third parties and a review of information filed by our competitors with the SEC or otherwise publicly available. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. All references in this Form 10-K to the Company , Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc. , we , us, or our are to Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc. 3 Table of Contents PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Organization On September 14, 2009, the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. Until the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we were engaged in the business of acquisition, exploration and development of natural resource properties. On April 17, 2018, under the laws of the State of Nevada, we changed our name from Lash, Inc. to Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc. On October 19, 2016, under the laws of the State of Nevada, we changed our name from Cassidy Ventures Inc. to Lash, Inc. Amber Joy Finney has served as our President and Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer and sole director since September 28, 2016. Ms. Finney is also the holder of 2,271,429 shares of our common stock, amounting to 51.6 of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. William Drury has served as our Secretary since February 19, 2013. William Drury also served as our Treasurer and sole director from February 19, 2013, until September 28, 2016. Mr. Drury also served as our President from July 31, 2015 until September 28, 2016. As of June 30, 2023, we were authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value .001 per share, and 25,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, par value 0.001 per share. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement raising substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our Business and Immediate Need for Financing On July 15, 2021, we acquired the assets of Paleo Scavenger, LLC for 10,000. Paleo owns the Within / Without Granola WWG brand. The purchase price includes the WWG trademarks, brands, books, records, intellectual property, commercial sales channel, customer lists and manufacturing rights. Early in 2021, WWG ceased operations and we restarted the manufacturing process in June 2022. We generated our first sales since inception during August 2022. We are currently selling our original and maple flavored granola products on Shopify. During February 2023, the inventory from the first run of the Within / Without Granola products expired and the remaining inventory was written off. The Company is searching for a new manufacturer to produce smaller batches of the Within / Without Granola products. As of October 12, 2023, a new manufacturer has not been engaged. We must raise at least 100,000 to commence our plan of operation, described above, and fund our ongoing operational expenses. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. If that financing is not available, we may be unable to continue our operations. Management believes that if we are successful in raising 100,000, we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, if such financing is not available, we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. Management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful, we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. If we are unsuccessful in raising at least 100,000 through a private placement, we will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a new, development stage business to obtain. Therefore, the Company is highly dependent upon the success of an anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in the Company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to the Company. However, if such financing were available, because we are a development stage company with little in the way of operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high-risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. If and when these funds are obtained, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load. If we cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of our common stock or secure debt financing, we would be required to cease business operations and as a result, investors in our common stock would lose all of their investment. Facilities We currently do not rent any real property or offices. Our current administrative business address is 999 N Northlake Way Ste 203, Seattle, Washington 98103-3442. We do not conduct any operations at such an address. The Company is looking for principal office space, appropriate for the Company s stage of development, in Gold Bar, Washington. ITEM 1A.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. OVERVIEW The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 14, 2009 and has established a fiscal year end of June 30. CASH FLOWS Our financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our company obtaining additional capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we could be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations. We have only realized nominal revenues from our business. In the next 12 months, we plan to identify business to whom we can license and/or distribute our brand and product(s) as well as seek additional opportunities to continue as a going concern. CRITICAL ACCOUTNING POLICIES Please refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview. Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc. is a Nevada corporation, originally formed on September 19, 2009. We are attempting to restart the Within / Without Granola WWG brand acquired on July 15, 2021. We generated our first sales in August 2022. We generated sales of 7,648 and -0- for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company has generated net losses of 42,825 and 38,537 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in net loss of 4,288 is attributable to the factors discussed below. Revenues. We had revenues of 7,648 and -0- for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We had our first sales of our original and maple flavored granola products in August 2022. During February 2023, the inventory from the first run of the Within / Without Granola products expired. The Company is searching for a new manufacturer to produce smaller batches of the Within / Without Granola products. As of October 12, 2023, a new manufacturer has not been engaged. Gross Margin. Once cost of revenue and other expenses to generate revenue are considered, we had reported gross margins of 1,752) and -0- for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The negative gross margin for the years ended June 30, 2023 resulted from the expiration of the Within / Without Granola inventory in February 2023. Expenses. For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, we incurred total operating expenses of 41,102 and 30,297. The increase of 10,805 was primarily a result from our July 15, 2021 acquisition of the Within / Without Granola brand, which resulted in an approximate increase of 8,000 of general and administrative expenses and an approximate increase in professional fees of 3,000. Other Income (Expense). Our total other income (expense) was 29 and 8,240) for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase of 8,269 was attributable to a 44 increase in other income related to the change in market value of shares issued to Mr. Drury but not yet sold (See Note 3 Related Party Transaction in the accompanying notes to the financial statements) and an 8,225 inventory impairment charge during the year ended June 30, 2022. The following table provides selected financial data about our company for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Balance Sheet Data June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Cash 2,067 13,555 Total Assets 6,192 28,904 Total Liabilities 266,445 248,187 Shareholders Deficit (260,253 (219,283 GOING CONCERN Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc. currently has limited operations. The financial statements in Item 8, have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has generated minimal revenues and incurred a loss since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of 19,258,251 at June 30, 2023 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock. In addition, our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc. which includes a statement raising substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our cash balance was 2,067 and working capital deficit was 264,378 at June 30, 2023. Total expenditures over the next 12 months are expected to be approximately 100,000. If we experience a shortage of funds prior to generating revenues from operations we may utilize funds from our directors, who have informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for operating costs, however they have no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to us. Management believes our current cash balance will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. 6 Table of Contents As at June 30, 2023, our total assets were 6,192 and were comprised of cash for 2,067, inventory for -0-, intellectual property for 3,125 (net of accumulated amortization) and trademarks for 1,000. The intellectual property and trademarks resulted from our July 15, 2021 acquisition of the Within / Without Granola brand. As at June 30, 2023, our current liabilities of 266,445 were comprised of accounts payable of 49,522, accrued liabilities for 48,257 and related party loans of 168,666. As at June 30, 2023, our stockholders deficiency was 260,253. Cash Flows from Operating Activities We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. Net cash used in operations was 35,938 and 25,678 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash Flows from Investing Activities For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, net cash flows used by investing activities was -0- and 10,000, respectively, from our asset purchase of Within / Without Granola on July 15, 2021. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, net cash flows provided by financing activities was 24,450 and 51,719, respectively from cash advances from our CEO. PLAN OF OPERATION Our plan of operation for the following twelve months is as follows: On July 15, 2021, we acquired the assets of Paleo Scavenger, LLC for 10,000. Paleo owns the Within / Without Granola WWG brand. The purchase price includes the WWG trademarks, brands, books, records, intellectual property, commercial sales channel, customer lists and manufacturing rights. Early in 2021, WWG ceased operations and we restarted the manufacturing process in June 2022. We generated our first sales since inception during August 2022. We are currently selling our original and maple flavored granola products on Shopify. During February 2023, the inventory from the first run of the Within / Without Granola products expired and the remaining inventory was written off. The Company is searching for a new manufacturer to produce smaller batches of the Within / Without Granola products. As of October 12, 2023, a new manufacturer has not been engaged. We must raise at least 100,000 to commence our plan of operation, described above, and fund our ongoing operational expenses. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. If that financing is not available, we may be unable to continue our operations. Management believes that if we are successful in raising 100,000, we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, if such financing is not available, we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. Management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful, we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. If we are unsuccessful in raising at least 100,000 through a private placement, we will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a new, development stage business to obtain. Therefore, the Company is highly dependent upon the success of an anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in the Company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to the Company.

If and when these funds are obtained, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load. If we cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of our common stock or secure debt financing, we would be required to cease business operations and as a result, investors in our common stock would lose all of their investment. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. ITEM 7A.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc. June 30, 2023 and 2022 Index to the Financial Statements Contents Page(s) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB: F-1 Balance Sheets at June 30, 2023 and 2022 F-2 Statements of Operations for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 F-3 Statement of Changes in Stockholders Deficiency for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 F-4 Statements of Cash Flow for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 F-5 Notes to the financial statements F-6 8 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the shareholders and the board of directors of Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc. as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. /S/ BF Borgers CPA PC (PCAOB ID 5041) We have served as the Company's auditor since 2021 October 11, 2023 F-1 Table of Contents ARTISAN CONSUMER GOODS, INC.

When it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through future income the Company must allow for this future tax benefit. We provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset, consisting of net operating loss carryforwards, because management has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carryforward period.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, we are responsible for conducting an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures means that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to our company, including any consolidating subsidiaries, and was made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2023. MANAGEMENT S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING As of June 30, 2023, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive officer and the principal financial officer and effected by the Company s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; Provide reasonable assurance our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statement. In evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on that evaluation, completed only by Amber Joy Finney, our President and Chief Officer, Treasurer and sole director, who also serves as our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, Ms. Finney concluded that, as of June 30, 2023, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (i) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (ii) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (iii) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our President and Chief Executive Officer, and sole Director, who also serves as our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, in connection with the review of our financial statements as of June 30, 2023. Management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION. None. 9 Table of Contents PART III ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Our executive officer s and director s and their respective ages as of June 30, 2023 are as follows: Name Age Positions and Offices Amber Joy Finney 44 President and Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer and director William Drury 60 Secretary The directors named above will serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders or until their respective resignation or removal from office. Thereafter, directors are anticipated to be elected for one-year terms at the annual stockholders meeting. Officers will hold their positions at the pleasure of the Board of Directors, absent any employment agreement, of which none currently exists or is contemplated. Set forth below is a brief description of the background and business experience of our executive officers and directors for the past five years. AMBER JOY FINNEY Ms. Finney has served as our President and Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and director since September 28, 2016. From October 2012 until December 2016, Ms. Finney served as President of VoiceFlix, a Seattle-area based advertising and marketing company, which she had founded. In 2004, Ms. Finney obtained a BA degree from The Evergreen State College. Ms. Finney s experience in advertising, marketing and sales led to our conclusion that Ms. Finney should be serving as a member of our board of directors in light of our business and structure. WILLIAM DRURY Mr. Drury has served as our secretary since February 19, 2013. Mr. Drury also served as our Treasurer and sole director from February 19, 2013, until September 28, 2016, and also served as our President from July 31, 2015 until September 28, 2016. Mr. Drury also serves as President and sole Director of Hub Deals Corp. Mr. Drury has over 19 years of executive level experience in a wide range of disciplines. Mr. Drury is President at General 3D Corp. Previously, Mr. Drury served as President of Quantum Genomics Corp., an international biochemical development business based in Paris, France. Mr. Drury has also served as Director of Production and Content Services at NewSight Corp., a software and hardware company that invents, manufactures, markets and sells auto stereoscopic LCD and Plasma displays and content. Prior to his time at NewSight, Mr. Drury was the Vice President of Production at VRex, a stereoscopic visualization technology company. At VRex, Mr. Drury designed, constructed, and staffed one of the first full time true 3D stereoscopic production facilities in the world, creating content for clients, such as, the United States Army, Merck, Merrill Lynch, and Pfizer. At VRex Mr. Drury s work was instrumental in the sale of VRex to the Malaysian Government for inclusion in their Cyber Jaya Technology Park. Mr. Drury holds degrees from Boston University and Baruch College. Mr. Drury is also a member of the boards of directors of Quantum Genomics Corporation, ICN Corporation and Global Oxygen Development Corp. TERM OF OFFICE All directors hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. The Company s Bylaws provide that the Board of Directors will consist of no less than three members. Officers are elected by and serve at the discretion of the Board of Directors. DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Our board of directors is currently composed of one member, which director does not qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of his or her family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, our board of directors has not made a subjective determination as to each director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made these determinations, our board of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each director s business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management. CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS No director, nominee for director, or executive officer of the Company has appeared as a party in any legal proceeding material to an evaluation of his ability or integrity during the past five years. SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS Other than our officers and directors, we currently have no other significant employees. AUDIT COMMITTEE AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee and does not have an audit committee financial expert, nor has the Board of Directors established a nominating committee. The Board is of the opinion that such committees are not necessary since the Company is an early exploration stage company and has only two directors, and to date, such directors have been performing the functions of such committees. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation, nominations, and audit issues that may affect management decisions. 10 Table of Contents There are no family relationships among our directors or officers. Other than as described above, we are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executive officers or directors. CODE OF ETHICS The Company has not adopted a code of ethics that applies to its principal executive officers, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. The Company has not adopted a code of ethics because it has only commenced operations. ITEM 11.
