 Overview 
 
 We are the leading independent designer and manufacturer of school buses, with more than 601,000 buses sold since our formation in 1927. 
 
 We review and present our business in two operating segments, which are also our reportable segments: (i) the Bus segment, which involves the design, engineering, manufacture and sale of school buses and extended warranties; and (ii) the Parts segment, which includes the sale of replacement bus parts. Financial information is reported on the basis that it is used internally by the chief operating decision maker CODM in evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments. The Chief Executive Officer of the Company has been identified as the CODM. Management evaluates the segments based primarily upon revenues and gross profit. Refer to Note 11, Segment Information , to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional financial information regarding our reportable segments including the primary geographic areas in which we earn revenues. 
 
 Throughout this Report, we refer to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 as fiscal 2023, the fiscal year ended October 1, 2022 as fiscal 2022 and the fiscal year ended October 2, 2021 as fiscal 2021. There were 52 weeks in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021.

Our performance in recent years has been driven by the implementation of repeatable processes focused on product initiatives, continuous improvement of both competitiveness and manufacturing flexibility, and lowering our cost of capital, as described below: 
 
 1. Alternative Power Initiatives We believe Blue Bird is the clear leader in alternative powered school buses (defined as buses that do not operate on diesel fuel) and we continue to introduce new products to support growing consumer demand for these products. 
 
 Propane In the fiscal year ended September 29, 2012 ("fiscal 2012"), we entered into our exclusive relationship with Ford Motor Company and Roush Clean Tech to offer propane powered Type C school buses. We have continued to lead the industry with this offering. 
 We launched the industry s first .05g/bhp-hr nitrogen oxide ("NOx") propane engine in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 ("fiscal 2017"). This engine operates four times cleaner than the current emission standard and is significantly better for the environment than competitors' published offerings. 
 We launched the industry s first .02g/bhp-hr NOx propane engine in August 2018. This engine complies with Ultra Low NOx classification and has an emissions level at 10 of the current standard and competitive offerings. 
 
 Electric Blue Bird is the first major school bus manufacturer to market, and presently the clear leader in, electric bus sales among all major original equipment manufacturers ("OEM"). We have partnered with Cummins, one of our long-standing engine suppliers, to design and develop our electric vehicle offering. We offer electric solutions in both our Type C and Type D buses and commenced delivery to customers in the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018 ("fiscal 2018"). With demand and interest growing quickly, we have taken, and will continue to take, actions to expand our electric vehicle production capacity. 
 
 Gasoline In the fiscal year ended October 1, 2016 ("fiscal 2016"), we re-introduced gasoline engines in school buses, again using a Ford engine and transmission and a Roush Clean Tech fuel usage evaporative emissions certification. This product has been successful and continues to grow the Blue Bird customer base. 
 
 2. Diesel Blue Bird works closely with Cummins on diesel engines, which continue to be the power source for the majority of buses sold in the school bus industry. 
 
 3. Product Initiatives We continue to update and improve our products. 
 
 During fiscal 2021, we successfully launched the all-new, Ford 7.3L V8 engine in our gasoline and propane powered offerings. 
 
 4. Manufacturing and Process Initiatives We commenced and have continued a number of initiatives to continue to build customer loyalty, reduce costs, and enhance competitiveness. 
 
 We launched our state-of-the-art 60,000 square foot paint facility in July 2019. Using robotic technology, the paint facility is designed to paint a bus three times faster than can be done manually, with a higher paint transfer rate and consistent, outstanding coverage. In keeping with Blue Bird's environmental awareness focus, the facility features a zero-to-landfill design. All paint over spray is captured, dried and sent to a power generation plant to be used as fuel. 
 
 During fiscal 2023, we opened the new Electric Vehicle Build-up Center, a transformed 40,000 square foot facility at the Fort Valley, Georgia manufacturing plant, designed to meet increasing demand for electric school buses. 
 
 5. Access to Capital We refinanced our term debt with substantially better terms in November 2023 via execution of the 2023 Credit Agreement (as defined below), which also provides total revolving commitments of 150.0 million. Additional details and discussion of this debt facility can be found in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of Item 7. "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Report. 
 
 Our management believes that Blue Bird is in a leading position in the industry due to our range of alternative power offerings and our strong diesel offering. We believe that our alternative power options will continue to capture market share in the industry as customers realize benefits on the total cost of ownership and as the adoption of green technology gains traction. Furthermore, we believe that our product, process, and manufacturing initiatives are appropriately aligned with our long-term objectives. 
 4 

As a result of the concentration of Blue Bird s sales in the school bus industry in the U.S. and Canada, our operations are affected by national, state, and local economic and political factors that impact spending for public and, to a lesser extent, private education. Unlike the discretionary portion of school budgets, the offering of school bus services is typically viewed as a mandatory part of the public infrastructure across the U.S. and Canada, ensuring that funding for new school buses receives some level of priority in all economic climates. All 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the 13 Canadian Provinces and Territories have fleets of school buses in operation. 
 
 Bus Segment 
 
 Our buses are sold through an extensive network of over 70 U.S. and Canadian dealer locations that, in their territories, are exclusive to our Company on Type C and Type D school buses. We also sell directly to major fleet operators, the U.S. Government, state governments and authorized dealers in certain limited foreign countries. 
 
 In fiscal 2023, we sold 8,514 buses throughout the world. Refer to Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion of our unit volumes. 
 
 Approximately 99 of our buses sold in fiscal 2023 were sold through distributors and dealers. The Company holds no equity or control position in any of the distributors or dealers. 
 
 We design, engineer, manufacture, and sell three types of buses: (i) Type C school buses, (ii) Type D school buses, and (iii) specialty buses. Each of our Type C and Type D buses is manufactured and assembled on its own dedicated purpose-built chassis in Fort Valley, Georgia. Regardless of specifications, all school bus bodies that we manufacture include our signature 14-gauge one-piece steel bows roof system, complemented by a rugged and sturdy floor structure. 
 
 Specialty buses include school buses that are converted to suit applications required by the U.S. Government, state and local governments, and various customers for commercial and export markets. 
 
 The Blue Bird Micro Bird by Girardin Type A bus is produced through Micro Bird Holdings, Inc., an unconsolidated Canadian joint venture with Girardin Minibus JV Inc. Micro Bird ), and is sold through our dealer network. This is a smaller bus than the Type C or Type D bus and is produced on a traditional chassis provided by either Ford or GM or on an electric chassis produced by a Micro Bird subsidiary. 
 
 Parts Segment 
 
 Parts are key for routine maintenance, replacement of parts that are damaged in service, and replacement of parts that suffer from wear and tear throughout the useful life of the vehicle. 
 
 In fiscal 2023, parts sales represented 8.7 of Company net sales. 
 
 We maintain a parts distribution center in Delaware, Ohio that fills demand for our Company specific and all-makes parts. Additional demand for parts is fulfilled by drop ship and direct sales. To fulfill demand for parts that are not maintained at the distribution center, we are linked to approximately 40 suppliers that ship directly to dealers and independent service centers. 
 
 Our network of dealers and authorized repair centers operate over 200 locations to support the fleet across the U.S. and Canada, the majority of which are owned by independent operators, to complement their primary locations. Field service engineers provide technical support to our dealer network. Service engineers are strategically placed throughout the U.S. and Canada to better serve both dealers and end-customers. The network leverages our parts inventory, technical training, and online warranty network to address customer service needs. 
 
 Our Industry 
 
 The school bus serves a critical role in the U.S. and Canadian education systems. In normal non-pandemic years, approximately half of the U.S. student population rides a school bus. School buses are distinguished from other types of buses by design characteristics associated with increased safety as mandated by federal, state, and municipal regulations. 
 
 Our management has developed a forecasting model using R.L. Polk vehicle registration data, population of school age children forecasts from the National Center for Education Statistics and bus ridership data collected and published by School Transportation News. Our management utilizes this and other models to assess historical experience and to predict demand for school buses in future 
 5 

periods. The ability to purchase new buses to fulfill predicted demand, however, is based on the assumption that funds will be available through property taxes and other state and federal sources. 
 
 The U.S. and Canadian school bus industry for Type C and Type D buses has averaged approximately 30,600 unit sales annually between 1985 and 2023. Unit sales for 2023 are projected to be about 29,000, an increase of 21.3 when compared with 2022. Both fiscal years were impacted by supply chain constraints that resulted in shortages of critical components that hindered the production of units across the school bus industry to meet strong demand for buses. 

Source: Historical registration data are based on R.L. Polk vehicle registration data. 
 
 The low point in the industry occurred in 2011, at approximately 23,800 units, and was the result of the decline in the U.S. economy and, in particular, the collapse of the housing market in 2008 and 2009. Property taxes are the primary source of funds for school bus purchases and were impacted in the 2010-2011 period as a result of the substantial recession in the U.S. economy in general, and housing market in particular, preceding and during that period. 
 
 The school bus industry fully recovered from the downturn in 2010-2011 and from 2016 to 2019 had been operating at levels approximately 10 higher than the long-term average, supported by positive demographic trends, pent-up demand from several years of below-trend bus sales, and a growing tax base for education-related spending. In 2020, countermeasures taken to battle the COVID-19 pandemic included virtual and hybrid schooling in many jurisdictions throughout the U.S. and Canada. The uncertainty of when and how schools would open materially affected demand within the Type C and Type D school bus industry in the second half of the Company's fiscal year ended October 3, 2020 ("fiscal 2020") that continued into the first half of fiscal 2021. However, demand for Type C and Type D school buses strengthened substantially throughout 2021 as COVID-19 vaccines were administered and many school jurisdictions returned to in-person learning environments. Nonetheless, subsequent supply chain shortages for certain components, such as microchips and products containing resins, that are critical to the manufacture of school buses, depressed sales during the latter half of fiscal 2021 and throughout fiscal 2022. Although management began to see improvements in the challenges caused by supply chain disruptions during fiscal 2023, there were still occasional shortages of certain components, as well as ongoing increases in raw materials costs. 
 
 Our management believes, based on our models, that Type C and Type D school bus registrations will return to a similar level as has been experienced over recent pre-pandemic years (2016-2019) once the supply chain constraints are fully addressed. We believe that (i) since the start of the pandemic and continuing through the subsequent period that has been significantly impacted by supply chain disruptions (i.e., the cumulative period beginning in the last half of fiscal 2020 and continuing through fiscal 2023), the industry has been operating below its historical long-term average of approximately 30,600 unit sales per year, (ii) there are over 146,000 buses in the U.S. and Canadian fleets that have been in service for 15 or more years, and (iii) the population of school age children is increasing. 
 
 6 

Local property and municipal tax receipts are key drivers of school district transportation budgets. Budgets for school bus purchases are directly related to property tax receipts. Home prices have risen in recent years as home inventories have not met demand, inflation of building materials cost has increased cost of construction, and as home-buyers have taken advantage of historically low mortgage rates prior to 2023. However, the forecast for continued appreciation in housing prices is uncertain due to, among others, recent rises in mortgage rates and significant inflationary pressures that have reduced consumer purchasing power. Nonetheless, such challenges are not expected to have a significant effect on property tax receipts in the near-term due to the lag that occurs in tax authorities reflecting declining home prices in property tax invoices, and school transportation budgets are expected to directly benefit from larger municipal spending budgets. We believe that incremental demand may be achieved as a result of (i) the average age of a school bus in service and (ii) an increased student population (based on information from the most recent National Center of Education Studies Projection of Education Statistics , we expect total student enrollment in the U.S. to increase by 2 , or 1 million students, from 2016 to 2028). 
 
 In addition to strong property tax collections, additional funding for school buses is being made available in connection with the Volkswagen ("VW") settlement with the U.S. Government in regard to emissions violations. Of the 14.7 billion in settlement funds, 2.9 billion was allocated to the VW Diesel Emissions Environmental Mitigation Trust for state government projects to reduce NOx output from ten categories; school buses are one of the ten categories. Of the grants awarded thus far, over 160 million has been issued to school bus projects and several states are continuing and/or increasing their focus on similar projects. Given the historical trend and future projections, we expect as much as 1 billion in additional VW settlement funds may ultimately be allocated, or have a high probability of allocation, to the purchases of "cleaner running" school buses through 2028. 
 
 Beyond the VW funds, traditional grant programs are expected to continue, including the U.S Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") National Clean Diesel Program and its various state versions. These are valuable programs for potential propane engine platform sales, as annual budgets for these programs usually range from 40.0 to 100.0 million. Additionally, in November 2020, the Bezos Earth Fund awarded a grant of 100 million, to be disbursed over a five-year period, to the World Resources Institute, a global research organization that focuses on climate initiatives, among others. A portion of this grant will be used to accelerate the adoption of zero emission school buses in the U.S. 
 In mid-November 2021, the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ("IIJA") was signed into law. The IIJA allocates 5 billion of federal funds to help local school jurisdictions purchase zero and low emission school buses over five years. Specifically, 2.5 billion of the funds are allocated solely for the purchase of electric powered buses, while the remaining 2.5 billion of funds are allocated for the purchase of low and zero emission school buses, including buses that are propane or electric powered. In October 2022, the EPA announced the awarding of approximately 913 million from the IIJA as part of its first round of funding for the Clean School Bus Rebate Program. Although the EPA has not yet released the final count of school buses that were awarded during the first round, it is estimated that approximately 2,000 zero and low emission school buses were ordered by awardees. The Company received orders for over 500 school buses, or approximately 25 of the estimated total. 
 
 In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA") was signed into law. The IRA authorizes a 369 billion investment in energy security and combating climate change. This funding includes 1 billion in grants for clean Class 6 and 7 heavy-duty vehicles, up to 40,000 in tax credits for zero-emission commercial vehicles, up to 100,000 in tax credits for heavy-duty charging infrastructure, and 2 billion for grants to support electric and fuel cell manufacturing. 
 Finally, in April 2023, the EPA released a second round of funding for the Clean School Bus Rebate Program, which made 400 million available in the form of competitive grants. The Company and its dealer network submitted grant applications on behalf of certain school district customers and also assisted certain other school district customers with completing and submitting their own grant applications. Awarding of grants is anticipated to begin in December 2023, with management estimating, based on the Company's historical market share as well as the number of school bus manufacturers competing for these orders, that the Company's share could approximate 25 or more. 
 We believe our leadership in alternative power options, coupled with this external funding, provides a strong foundation to continue to increase sales of our propane, gasoline and electric powered bus platforms. 
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 
 We believe that our competitive strengths are derived from the following factors: 
 
 Reputation for safety, product quality/reliability/durability, and drivability . Our longevity and reputation in the school bus industry have made us an iconic American brand. We are the only principal manufacturer with chassis and body production specifically designed for school bus applications in the U.S. and the only school bus company to offer as a standard feature compliance with industry recognized safety tests - Altoona Testing, Colorado Rack Test and the Kentucky Pole Test - as a standard specification across our entire product line. 
 
 Alternative powered bus leadership . We believe we are the market leader in propane, gasoline and electric powered buses, having sold approximately 64 of all alternative powered school buses from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2023, we sold 5,283 
 7 

propane, gasoline, compressed natural gas ("CNG") and electric powered buses, an increase of 33 when compared with the prior year, as market demand for alternative powered buses remained robust. To maintain our leadership position, we continue to expand the available features requested by our customers and during fiscal 2022, added a hydraulic braking system with electronic stability control and a fuel-fired heater for cold-weather markets to our Type C electric powered bus offering. Additionally, during fiscal 2023, we opened the new Electric Vehicle Build-up Center, a transformed 40,000 square foot facility at the Fort Valley, Georgia manufacturing plant, designed to meet increasing demand for electric school buses. 
 
 Innovative product leadership . We believe we have consistently led the school bus industry with innovative product leadership through several industry firsts, including the first unique school bus chassis and the first OEM-manufactured propane powered bus. In fiscal 2016, years ahead of our competition, we launched the industry's first gasoline powered Type C bus (utilizing an exclusive Ford engine and transmission and Roush CleanTech fuel usage evaporative emissions certification) and we were first-to-market with electronic stability control. In fiscal 2018, we sold our first Type D electric vehicles and in the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019 ("fiscal 2019"), we introduced our Type C electric vehicle. In fiscal 2023, we sold 546 Type C and Type D electric vehicles. 
 
 Strong distribution model . We have built an extensive, experienced network of over 70 dealer locations to distribute our buses across the U.S. and Canada, and during recent years have significantly enhanced our relationships with large fleet operators. Our dealers have an average tenure of more than 31 years with us and do not sell competing Type C or Type D school bus products in the areas assigned to them by us. 
 
 Highly-skilled and committed workforce . We benefit from a highly-skilled, committed hourly workforce of approximately 1,574 employees who support our customized assembly operations at our 900,000 square foot integrated chassis manufacturing and body assembly facility and 340,000 square foot component fabrication facility. Our employees are trained to maximize production efficiency by following customized processes developed by us. 
 
 Strong management team . We are led by a highly experienced and committed management team with an established track record in the U.S. and Canadian school bus and heavy-duty vehicle industries. 
 
 Sales Volume 
 
 In fiscal 2023, we sold 8,514 Type C and Type D buses, including 8,410 school buses, 61 commercial buses, 16 export buses and 27 Government Services Administration ("GSA") buses. Our Type C school bus accounted for 87 of unit sales and our Type D school bus accounted for 12 of unit sales. Commercial, GSA and export buses, which can be ordered with either the Type C or Type D chassis, accounted for the remaining 1 of unit sales. 
 
 Our Dealer Network 
 
 In fiscal 2023, we sold approximately 99 of our vehicles through our U.S. and Canadian dealer network, currently consisting of over 70 dealer locations that, in their territories, are exclusive to us with Type C and D school buses. School buses sold in the U.S. and Canada through our dealer network are purchased by school districts and private schools, as well as small and medium size contractors that provide services to school districts on a fee basis. Bus purchases and contractor fees are funded through local school district budgets. Purchases of school buses are typically made through a bid process at the district or state level, with dealers coordinating this process. Dealers develop collaborative relationships with school districts, district transportation directors, and key officials in their states. 
 
 Our dealers have access to financing through a financing product maintained by an independent third party, Huntington Distribution Finance, Inc. ("Huntington"). We do not assume any balance sheet risk with respect to this type of financing and do not receive any direct economic benefit from Huntington. 
 
 Other Distribution Channels 
 
 Fleet Operators . We also sell school buses directly to large national fleets that span multiple states and such sales are managed internally by our National Account Sales Team. 
 
 Export Dealers . We regularly monitor opportunities to sell our Type C and Type D buses in either school bus or other configurations in certain limited international markets and typically sell these products through dealers assigned to those territories. 
 
 U.S. Government; Other Specialty Sales . We also sell buses through our U.S. GSA contract, an expedited procurement procedure designed to meet the needs of bus customers authorized to purchase through the GSA contracting offices, including the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This full line of bus models is configured for adult or school bus use. In addition to the base GSA specifications, we offer several additional configurations to provide a wide range of 
 8 

passenger capacities and optional features. We also offer a full line of activity bus and Multi-Function School Activity Bus MFSAB products. With varying vehicle sizes, capacities, power choices, and engine types, our bus options enable our customers to tailor their transportation solutions to their specific needs, be it transporting a church congregation or shuttling workers to job sites. 
 
 Government Contracts 
 
 As a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to specific regulations and requirements as mandated by our contracts. These regulations include Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the Code of Federal Regulations. We are also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Management Agency and Defense Contract Audit Agency. These agencies review and assess compliance with contractual requirements, cost structure, cost accounting, and applicable laws, regulations, and standards. 
 
 A portion of our existing U.S. government contracts extend over multiple years and are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations. In addition, our U.S. government contracts generally permit the contracting government agency to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, either for the convenience of the government or for default based on our failure to perform under the terms of the contract. 
 
 Suppliers 
 
 We purchase our engine and transmission components on a single-source basis from major OEMs with sophisticated engineering, production and logistics capabilities, as reflected in the table below: 
 Component OEM Supplier Diesel engines 
 Cummins Inc. Diesel emissions kits Cummins Inc. Electric powertrains and battery systems Cummins Inc. Propane and gasoline engines and transmissions Ford Motor Company Transmissions Allison Transmission Propane fueling kits 
 Roush CleanTech 

Our purchasing department continually works to improve our purchasing processes by rationalizing the supplier base and by implementing improved control processes. We regularly perform supplier audits and, when necessary, will meet with under-performing suppliers in order to enhance performance. At September 30, 2023, we had in place long-term supply contracts (addressing both component price and supply) covering nearly 69 of the value of our purchases from suppliers, including long-term agreements with our major single-source suppliers. 
 
 As a result of ongoing supply chain disruptions that began in the latter half of fiscal 2021 and continued throughout fiscal 2023, we have experienced significant supplier shortages of critical components, which prevented the Company from initiating or completing, as applicable, the production process for certain units that were otherwise scheduled to be delivered to customers during fiscal 2021, fiscal 2022 and, to a lesser extent, fiscal 2023. For further details and discussion about the impact of these supply chain disruptions, refer to the "Impacts of COVID-19 and Subsequent Supply Chain Constraints on Our Business" section of Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
 
 Competition 
 
 The U.S. and Canadian school bus industry is highly competitive. Our two principal competitors are Thomas Built Bus and IC Bus. Thomas Built Bus is a subsidiary of Daimler Trucks North America and IC Bus is a subsidiary of Navistar, Inc. 
 
 We compete primarily on the basis of product diversification, school bus innovation, safety, quality, durability and drivability of our products, the scope and strength of our dealer network and price. As our principal competitors are parts of larger corporations, our competitors may have greater access to financial capital, human resources, and business opportunities. Such access, in turn, may be used by such companies to compete with us and others in the industry. 
 
 Facilities 
 
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Macon, Georgia and we have an additional office in Troy, Michigan. Our Bus segment operates a fabrication plant and an integrated chassis manufacturing and body assembly plant in Fort Valley, Georgia, where components for Type C, Type D, and specialty buses are manufactured and assembled. Our Parts segment operates a parts distribution 
 9 

center located in Delaware, Ohio. We own our facilities in Fort Valley, Georgia (approximately 1.5 million square feet). We lease facilities in Macon, Georgia (approximately 0.3 million square feet), Troy, Michigan (approximately 5 thousand square feet) and Delaware, Ohio (approximately 0.1 million square feet). Our Micro Bird joint venture leases its facility (0.2 million square feet) in Drummondville, Quebec, Canada. 
 
 Intellectual Property and Technology 
 
 We seek trademark protection in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. where available and when appropriate. Among other trademarks, we have registered trademark rights in the principal names and designs used by us and Micro Bird in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere. We use these registered marks in connection with all aspects of our branding. However, we also rely on a number of significant unregistered trademarks and other unregistered intellectual property in the day-to-day operation of our business. Without the protections afforded by registration, our ability to protect and use our trademarks and other unregistered intellectual property may be limited and could negatively affect our business. 
 
 In addition to trademarks, we rely heavily on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our product designs, manufacturing processes and cost containment steps are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, suppliers and other commercial partners. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, designs and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our suppliers or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how. 
 
 Government Regulation 
 
 Our products must satisfy various legal, environmental, health and safety requirements at federal, state and municipal levels. Compliance with such requirements adds to the costs that must be incurred in order to manufacture a school bus. Failure to comply with such requirements could lead to substantial additional regulatory costs. 
 
 At the federal level, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards FMVSS govern the safety of all motor vehicles sold for use in the U.S. More than half of the FMVSS regulations apply to school buses. For example, federal regulations require school buses to be painted school bus yellow and to be equipped with specific warning and safety devices. School buses are also built with the body on top of chassis frame rails. This so-called high floor construction moves the passenger compartment above the typical automotive crash zone and therefore provides an added measure of safety should a collision occur. Steel rollover cages and heavy-duty bumpers are designed to provide incremental protection, in contrast with standard transit buses with low floor construction that offer lower curb height access with limited or no steel reinforcement. 
 
 After a school bus is sold, regulation of the operation of the school bus becomes the responsibility of the state in which it operates. Today, each state has its own rules and regulations pertaining to the manufacture, design, operation and safety of the school buses operated in their jurisdictions. As a result, we cannot manufacture to a single set of specifications, but rather must assure that each manufactured bus conforms to the specifications of the particular jurisdiction in which it will be operated. 
 
 We must also consider the rules and regulations of foreign jurisdictions. In Canada, where our Micro Bird joint venture operates, school buses are governed by the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations. These regulations are patterned after the FMVSS regulations, although differences do exist between the two regulatory systems. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Historically, our business has been highly seasonal with school districts buying their new school buses so that they will be available for use on the first day of the school year, typically in mid-August to early September. This has resulted in our third and fourth fiscal quarters becoming our two busiest quarters, the latter ending on the Saturday closest to September 30. Our quarterly results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity have historically been, and are likely to be in future periods, impacted by seasonal patterns. Working capital has historically been a significant use of cash during the first fiscal quarter due to planned shutdowns and a significant source of cash generation in the fourth fiscal quarter. 
 
 10 

As a result of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply chain constraints, seasonality and working capital trends have become unpredictable. Accordingly, seasonality and variations from historical seasonality have impacted the comparison of working capital and liquidity results between fiscal periods. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and health and safety, including those regulating the following: soil, surface water and groundwater contamination; the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of materials, including greenhouse gases GHG into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. We have taken various steps to comply with these numerous and sometimes complex laws, regulations and permits. Compliance with environmental requirements historically has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures pursuant to such requirements. If we violate or fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to fines, penalties, enforcement actions or lawsuits. 
 
 For additional information regarding potential environmental issues at Blue Bird s Fort Valley, Georgia facility, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risk Factors Relating to Our Business and Industry - Environmental obligations and liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial condition, cash flows and profitability." 
 
 Environmental laws, regulations, and permits and the enforcement thereof, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. Among other things, more rigorous GHG emission requirements are in various stages of development. For example, the U.S. EPA has promulgated the GHG Reporting Rule, which requires reporting of GHG data and other relevant information from large sources and suppliers in the U.S., and the GHG Tailoring Rule, which requires certain facilities with significant GHG emissions to obtain emissions permits under the authority of the Clean Air Act (typically limited to only the largest stationary sources of GHG). The U.S. Congress has also considered imposing additional restrictions on GHG emissions. Any additional regulation of GHG emissions by either the U.S. Congress and/or the U.S. EPA could include a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement, or other program and could subject us to significant costs, including those relating to emission credits, pollution control equipment, monitoring, and reporting, as well as increased energy and raw material prices. 
 
 Our facilities and operations could in the future be subject to regulations related to climate change and climate change itself may also have some impact on the Company s operations. However, these impacts are currently uncertain and the Company cannot presently predict the nature and scope of those impacts. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards , to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on research and development. 
 
 Warranty 
 
 We provide warranties on virtually all of the buses and parts we sell. Warranties are offered for specific periods of time and mileage, and vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale. Pursuant to these warranties, we will repair, replace, or adjust certain parts on a bus that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship during the specified warranty period. In addition to the costs associated with this warranty coverage provided on our vehicles, we also incur costs as a result of field service actions (i.e., safety recalls and service bulletins), and customer satisfaction actions. Component suppliers, in particular major component suppliers such as engines and transmissions, provide warranties on their products. 
 
 Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are engaged in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. Although no assurances can be given about the final outcome of pending legal proceedings, at the present time our management does not believe that the resolution or outcome of any of our pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 
 
 11 

Human Capital Management 
 
 Blue Bird delivers market value to stockholders through a people centered human capital strategy, critical to our ability to deliver on our strategic plans. Our success in delivering high quality products and solutions for our customers is only achievable through the talent, expertise, and dedication of our workforce. 
 
 Attraction, Development, and Retention 
 
 We recognize that attracting, developing and retaining skilled talent and promoting a diverse and inclusive culture are essential to maintaining our leadership position in the markets we serve. We offer employees resources to continuously improve their skills and performance with the goal of further cultivating the diverse, entrepreneurial talent to fill key positions. We seek people who are proactive and dedicated, demonstrate an ownership mindset and share our commitment to the pursuit of operational excellence. We continue to make significant investments in talent development and recognize that the growth and development of our employees is essential for our continued success. Employee training and development programs are extensive and comprehensive, including professional and technical skills training, compliance training, leadership development and management training. 
 
 We view the diversity of our employees as a strength to better serve our customers and communities. We also believe the diversity of our workforce enables us to attract new talent, keeps our employees engaged and productive, and advances ideas reflecting the diversity of our employees' backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. To that end, we have taken various actions to enhance diversity, including partnering with organizations that can support our efforts to identify and recruit talented and diverse candidates. 
 
 We aim to cultivate an inclusive culture that enables employees to feel connected to Blue Bird's three foundational objectives (Care, Delight, Deliver) while being valued for their contributions. One of the ways in which we seek to promote an inclusive work environment is by supporting the establishment of employee resource groups. These groups allow for collaboration and serve as an open forum for networking, professional development, and mentoring. We are committed to our efforts to maintain a work environment that is professional, inclusive, and free from discrimination and harassment. 
 
 The Company s benefit packages support employee physical, emotional and financial well-being. Employee satisfaction and engagement are measured through periodic surveys. 
 
 Health and Safety 
 
 Safety is a key priority at all of our facilities and as such, we have invested in a safety and health department staffed with trained medical personnel. The Company s leaders and managers continuously address safety enhancements, provide regular and ongoing safety training, and use displays located near our employee work areas to provide all employees with safety-related information. 
 
 Employees 
 
 At September 30, 2023, we employed 1,830 employees, of which 1,829 were full-time. 
 
 On May 22, 2023, the National Labor Relations Board NLRB certified the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC USW as the exclusive bargaining representative for a bargaining unit of the Company s full-time and regular part-time production, maintenance, quality control, and warehouse employees at the Company s Fort Valley and Macon, Georgia locations, with certain exceptions. The bargaining unit consists of approximately 1,400 employees. As a result, the Company is obligated to bargain with the USW as the bargaining representative for employees within the designated bargaining unit. The Company has recently commenced bargaining sessions and thus, has not yet entered into any collective bargaining agreement as of September 30, 2023. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Report, including matters addressed in the section entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. We may face additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the financial statements included in this Report. 
 
 Risk Factors Relating to Our Business and Industry 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply chain constraints have had, and other public health crises, epidemics or pandemics could have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, particularly resulting from reductions in demand for our products, shortages of critical components that hinder the 
 12 

production of units to fulfill sales orders, disruptions or other developments negatively impacting our workforce or workplace conditions, and/or reduced access to capital markets and reductions in liquidity. 
 
 Beginning in our second quarter of fiscal 2020, the novel coronavirus known as "COVID-19" began to spread throughout the world, resulting in a global pandemic. The pandemic has, among other impacts: 
 
 negatively impacted demand for school buses due to schools operating totally or partially virtually, primarily during the second half of fiscal 2020 and first half of fiscal 2021; 
 
 triggered significant volatility in capital markets; 
 
 caused significant disruptions in global supply chains primarily impacting the Company beginning during the second half of fiscal 2021, all of fiscal 2022 and continuing, to a lesser extent, throughout fiscal 2023; 
 
 significantly altered global consumer demand; 
 
 halted a material number of global manufacturing operations resulting from permanent and temporary plant shut-downs; and 
 
 changed global workplace conditions resulting from "shelter-in-place" orders and "work from home" employer policies. 
 
 The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic and other future outbreaks could impact our future business, results of operations and financial condition depends on future developments, which are uncertain, including but not limited to the duration, spread and severity of future outbreaks, government responses and other actions to mitigate the spread of and to treat COVID-19, and when and to what extent business, economic and social activity and conditions are disrupted. We are similarly unable to predict the extent to which any future COVID-19 outbreaks could impact our customers, suppliers and other partners and their financial conditions, but adverse effects on these parties would likely also adversely affect us. Finally, the threat of future COVID-19 outbreaks makes it challenging for management to estimate the future performance of our business. 
 
 While the reduction in the demand of school buses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic began subsiding around the middle of calendar year 2021, the industry began experiencing significant supply chain constraints resulting from, among others, labor shortages due to the great resignation; the lack of maintenance on, and acquisition of, capital assets during the extended COVID-19 global lockdowns; significant increased demand for consumer products containing certain materials required for the production of vehicles, such as microchips, as consumers spent stimulus and other funds on items for their homes; etc. These supply chain disruptions had a significant adverse impact our operations and results due to higher purchasing costs, including freight costs incurred to expedite receipt of critical components, increased manufacturing inefficiencies and hindered ability to complete the production of buses to fulfill sales orders, primarily during the latter half of fiscal 2021 and most of fiscal 2022. The continuing development and fluidity of COVID-19 outbreaks and subsequent supply chain constraints precludes any prediction as to the ultimate severity of the adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 
 At the present time, we consider the following areas to be the most significant material risks to our business resulting from the pandemic and subsequent supply chain constraints: 
 
 Supply Chain Disruptions 
 
 We rely on specialist suppliers, some of which are single-source suppliers, for critical components (including but not limited to engines, transmissions and axles) and replacement of any of these components with like parts from another supplier normally requires engineering and testing resources, which entail costs and take time. We also currently rely on a limited number of single-source suppliers and/or have limited alternatives for important bus parts such as diesel engines and emission components, propane and gasoline engines including powertrains, control modules, steering systems, seats, specialty resins, and other key components. Future delays or interruptions in the supply chain expose us to the following risks which would likely significantly increase our costs and/or impact our ability to meet customer demand: 
 
 we or our third-party suppliers may lose access to critical services and components, resulting in an interruption in the manufacture, assembly, and delivery or shipment of our products; 
 
 we or our third-party suppliers may not be able to respond to unanticipated changes in customer orders; 
 
 we or our suppliers may have excess or inadequate inventory of materials and components; 
 
 13 

we or our third-party suppliers may be subject to price fluctuations, including for inbound freight costs that are incurred to transport goods and supplies to production facilities, and a lack of long-term supply arrangements for key components; 
 
 we may experience delays in delivery by our third-party suppliers due to changes in demand from us or their other customers; 
 
 fluctuations in demand for products that our third-party suppliers manufacture for others may affect their ability or willingness to deliver components to us in a timely manner; 
 
 we may not be able to find new or alternative components or reconfigure our products and manufacturing processes in a timely manner if the necessary components become unavailable; and 
 
 our third-party suppliers may encounter financial hardships unrelated to our demand, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements. 
 
 Disruptions or other developments negatively impacting our workforce or workplace conditions 
 
 Almost all U.S. states, including Georgia where our headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located, issued, primarily during calendar years 2020 and 2021, shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders, restrictions and recommendations for their residents to control the spread of COVID-19. These orders could be re-issued in the future and could introduce broader restrictions. Such orders, restrictions and recommendations resulted in widespread closures of businesses, work stoppages, interruptions, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies and travel restrictions. While our business was deemed "essential" by the State of Georgia, we employed remote work policies when and where necessary to be responsive to the health risks that could impact our employees. Given the nature of our business, we do not have the ability to manufacture a bus without our on-site manufacturing personnel. While we have not experienced any pervasive COVID-19 illnesses to date, if we were to experience some form of outbreak within our facilities, we would take all appropriate measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, which could include a temporary halt in production. Any extended production halt or diminution in production capacity would have a negative impact on our ability to fulfill orders and thus negatively impact our revenues, profitability and cash flows. 
 
 Reduced profitability and liquidity, resulting in the restructuring of our credit facilities, and/or inadequate access to credit and capital markets 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply chain disruption have materially adversely impacted global commercial activity and contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. The supply chain constraints, including the resulting inflationary environment that has developed, continue to have a material adverse impact on economic and market conditions, potentially reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. 
 
 Future COVID-19 outbreaks and/or continuing supply chain constraints could cause a more severe contraction in our profits and/or liquidity, which could lead to issues complying with the financial covenants in our credit facility. Beginning in the fiscal year ending September 28, 2024 ("fiscal 2024") and thereafter, our primary financial covenants are (i) a pro forma Total Net Leverage Ratio ("TNLR"), defined as the ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA (which is an adjusted EBITDA metric that could differ from Adjusted EBITDA appearing in the Company s periodic filings on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q as the adjustments to the calculations are not uniform) on a trailing four quarter basis, of not greater than 3.00:1.00 and (ii) a pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the 2023 Credit Agreement, which is discussed below) of not less than 1.20:1.00. If we are not able to comply with such covenants, we may need to seek amendment for covenant relief or even refinance the debt to a "covenant lite" or "no covenant" structure. We can offer no assurances that we would be successful in amending or refinancing the debt. An amendment or refinancing of our debt could lead to higher interest rates and possible up-front expenses not included in our historical financial statements. 
 
 The military conflict in Ukraine, and future military conflicts in other countries, could cause additional supply chain disruptions that could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, the ongoing pressure on the global supply chain was further exacerbated as a result of Russia s invasion of Ukraine towards the end of February 2022. Both countries have large quantities of minerals and other natural resources that impact commodity costs, such as diesel fuel, steel, rubber and resin, among others, and the conflict has further restricted access to inventory that is at least partially dependent upon such commodities, primarily for the Company s suppliers. Such restricted access has, in certain cases, limited our ability to obtain critical component parts and/or resulted in us paying premium prices for freight and to access the limited supply of inventory. The degree to which this conflict impacts our future business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments, which are uncertain, including but not limited to the duration of, 
 14 

potential spread and severity of, and additional governmental actions in response to, the conflict and when and to what extent normal business and economic activity and conditions resume and continue without further disruption. 
 
 General economic conditions in the markets we serve have a significant impact on demand for our buses. 
 
 The school bus market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in the level of spending by municipalities. The principal factors underlying spending by municipalities are housing prices, property tax levels, municipal budgeting issues and voter initiatives. Demand for school buses is further influenced by overall acquisition priorities of municipalities, availability of school bus financing, student population changes, school district busing policies, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices and environmental regulations. Significant deterioration in the economic environment, housing prices, property tax levels or municipal budgets could result in fewer new orders for school buses or could cause customers to seek to postpone or reduce orders, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows. 
 
 We may be unable to obtain critical components from suppliers, which could disrupt or delay our ability to deliver products to customers. 
 
 We rely on specialist suppliers for critical components (including engines, transmissions and axles) and replacement of any of these components with like parts from another supplier normally requires engineering and testing resources, which entail costs and take time. The lack of ready-to-implement alternatives could give such suppliers, some of which have substantial market power, significant leverage over us if these suppliers elected to exert their market power over us, which leverage could adversely impact the terms and conditions of purchase, including pricing, warranty claims and delivery schedules. We seek to mitigate supply chain risks with our key suppliers by entering into long-term agreements, by commencing contract negotiations with suppliers of critical components significantly before contract expiration dates, and by diversifying our suppliers of key components with contingency programs when possible. 
 
 If any of our critical component suppliers limit or reduce the supply of components due to commercial reasons, financial difficulties or other problems, we could experience a loss of revenues due to our inability to fulfill orders, as was the case in the second half of fiscal 2021 and throughout much of fiscal 2022. These single-source and other suppliers are each subject to quality and operational issues, materials shortages, unplanned demand, reduction in capacity and other factors that may disrupt the flow of goods to us or to our customers, which would adversely affect our business and customer relationships. 
 
 We have no assurance that our suppliers will continue to meet our requirements. If supply arrangements are interrupted, we may not be able to find another supplier on a timely or satisfactory basis. We may incur significant set-up costs, delays and lag time in manufacturing should it become necessary to replace any key suppliers. Our business interruption insurance coverage may not be adequate for any interruptions that we could encounter and may not continue to be available in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. Production delays could, under certain circumstances, result in penalties or liquidated damages in certain of our GSA contracts. 
 
 We rely substantially on single-source suppliers which could materially and adversely impact us if they were to interrupt the supply of component parts to us. 
 
 We currently rely on a limited number of single-source suppliers and/or have limited alternatives for important bus parts such as diesel engines and emission components, propane and gasoline engines including powertrains, control modules, air brakes, steering systems, seats, specialty resins, and other key components. Shortages and allocations by such manufacturers may result in inefficient operations and a build-up of inventory, which could negatively affect our working capital position, as was the case during the second half of fiscal 2021 and throughout much of fiscal 2022. 
 
 Our products may not achieve or maintain market acceptance or competing products could gain market share, which could adversely affect our competitive position. 
 
 We operate in a highly competitive domestic market. Our principal competitors are Thomas Built Bus (owned by Daimler Trucks North America) and IC Bus (owned by Navistar, Inc.), which, at the consolidated level, have potential access to more technical, financial and marketing resources than the Company. Our competitors may develop or gain access to products that are superior to our products, develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services, or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. IC Bus and Thomas Built Bus both sell electric powered school buses. This brings both competitors into direct competition with our electric powered product offerings. Our competitors may achieve cost savings or be able to withstand a substantial downturn in the market because their businesses are consolidated with other vehicle lines. In addition, our competitors could be, and have been in the past, vertically integrated by designing and manufacturing their own components (including engines) to reduce their costs. The school bus market does not have Buy America regulations, so competitors or new entrants to the market could manufacture school buses in more cost-effective jurisdictions and import them to the U.S. to 
 15 

compete with us. Any increase in competition may cause us to lose market share or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced sales, profitability and cash flows. 
 
 Our business is cyclical, which has had, and could have future, adverse effects on our sales and results of operations and lead to significant shifts in our results of operations from quarter to quarter that make it difficult to project long-term performance. 
 
 The school bus market historically has been and is expected to resume being, at some point in the relatively near future, cyclical. This cyclicality has an impact both on the school bus industry and also on the comparative analysis of quarterly results of our Company. 
 
 Customers historically have replaced school buses in lengthy cycles. Moreover, weak macroeconomic conditions can adversely affect demand for new school buses and lead to an overall aging of school bus fleets beyond a typical replacement cycle. To the extent the increase in school bus demand is attributable to pent-up demand rather than overall economic growth, future school bus sales may lag behind improvements in general economic conditions or property tax levels. During downturns, we may find it necessary to reduce line rates and employee levels due to lower overall demand. An economic downturn may reduce, and in the past, including during the first half of fiscal 2021, has reduced, demand for school buses, resulting in lower sales volumes, lower prices and decreased profits. 
 
 Primarily as a result of the historical seasonal nature of our business, we may operate with negative working capital for significant portions of our fiscal year. During economic downturns, this tends to result in our utilizing a substantial portion of our cash reserves. 
 
 Our ability to sell our products may be negatively affected by trade policies and tariffs. 
 
 We import some of our components from China and other foreign countries. Our purchases may be subject to the effects of the U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and anti-dumping/countervailing duties on these components. We can provide no assurance that our ability to sell our products at reasonable margins will not be impaired by the imposition of tariffs or other changes in trade policy which may make it more difficult or more expensive to purchase our products. 
 
 At times we enter into firm fixed-price school bus sales contracts without price escalation clauses that could subject us to reduced gross profits or losses if we have cost overruns or if our costs increase. 
 
 We sometimes provide fixed-price bids on potential school bus orders months before the expected delivery date. Also, a substantial amount of time may lapse between the bid date and the date that a school bus sales contract containing a fixed price is executed. The sales bids historically have not included price escalation provisions to account for economic fluctuations between the bid date and delivery date. As a result, we have historically been unable to pass along to our customers increased costs due to economic fluctuations between these dates as was the case during the second half of fiscal 2021, all of fiscal 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which is generally not expected to continue as the Company now includes price escalation provisions when bidding on contracts. However, once a sales contract containing a fixed bus price is executed with a customer, we are generally unable to pass along increased costs resulting from economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date. We generally purchase steel at fixed prices up to four quarters in advance, with larger quantities subject to fixed price purchase contracts in the more immediate upcoming quarters with quantities decreasing in later quarters, but because we usually do not hedge our other primary raw materials (rubber, aluminum and copper), changes in prices of raw materials can significantly impact operating margins. Our actual costs and any gross profit realized on fixed-price sales contracts could vary from the estimated costs on which these contracts were originally based. 
 
 New laws, regulations or governmental policies regarding environmental, health and safety standards, or changes in existing ones, may have a significant negative impact on how we do business. 
 
 Our products must satisfy various legal, environmental, health and safety requirements, including applicable emissions and fuel economy requirements. Meeting or exceeding government-mandated safety standards can be difficult and costly. Such regulations are extensive and may, in certain circumstances, operate at cross purposes. While we are managing our product development and production operations to reduce costs, unique local, state, federal and international standards can result in additional costs for product development, testing and manufacturing. We depend on third party single-source suppliers to comply with applicable emissions and fuel economy standards in the manufacture of engines supplied to us for our buses. Increased environmental, safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulations may result in additional costs and lag time to introduce new products to market. 
 16 

Safety or durability incidents associated with a school bus malfunction may result in loss of school bus sales that could have material adverse effects on our business. 
 
 The school bus industry has few participants due to the importance of brand and reputation for safety and durability, compliance with stringent safety and regulatory requirements, an understanding of the specialized product specifications in each region and specialized technological and manufacturing know-how. If incidents associated with school bus malfunction transpired that called into question our reputation for safety or durability, it could harm our brand and reputation and cause consumers to question the safety, reliability and durability of our products. Lost school bus sales resulting from safety or durability incidents could materially adversely affect our business. 
 
 Disruption of our manufacturing and distribution operations would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We manufacture school buses at facilities in Fort Valley, Georgia and distribute parts from a distribution center located in Delaware, Ohio. If operations at our manufacturing or distribution facilities were to be disrupted for a significant length of time as a result of significant equipment failures, critical component shortages, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, adverse weather conditions, labor disputes, cyber-attacks or other reasons, we may be unable to fulfill dealer or customer orders and otherwise meet demand for our products, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any interruption in production or distribution capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to fulfill customer orders, which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition. We maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations. Also, our property damage and business interruption insurance coverage may not be applicable or adequate for any such disruption and may not continue to be available in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. 
 
 Rationalization or restructuring of manufacturing facilities, including plant expansions and system upgrades at our manufacturing facilities, may cause production capacity constraints and inventory fluctuations. 
 
 The rationalization of our manufacturing facilities has at times resulted in, and similar rationalizations or restructurings in the future may result in, temporary constraints upon our ability to produce the quantity of products necessary to fulfill orders and thereby complete sales in a timely manner. In addition, system upgrades at our manufacturing facilities that impact ordering, production scheduling and other related manufacturing processes are complex, and could impact or delay production targets. A prolonged delay in our ability to fulfill orders on a timely basis could affect customer demand for our products and increase the size of our raw material inventories, causing future reductions in our manufacturing schedules and adversely affecting our results of operations. Moreover, our continuous development and production of new products will often involve the retooling of existing manufacturing equipment. This retooling may limit our production capacity at certain times in the future, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the expansion, reconfiguration, maintenance and modernization of existing manufacturing facilities and the start-up of new manufacturing operations, could increase the risk of production delays and require significant investments of capital. 
 
 We may incur material losses and costs related to product warranty claims. 
 
 We are subject to product warranty claims in the ordinary course of our business. Our standard warranty covers the bus for one year and certain components for up to five years. We attempt to adequately price ongoing warranty costs into our bus purchase contracts; however, our warranty reserves are estimates and if we produce poor quality products, develop new products with deficiencies or receive defective materials or components, we may incur material unforeseen costs in excess of what we have provided for in our contracts or reserved in our financial statements. 
 
 In addition, we may not be able to enforce warranties and extended warranties received or purchased from our suppliers if such suppliers refuse to honor such warranties or go out of business. Also, a customer may choose to pursue remedies directly under its contract with us over enforcing such supplier warranties. In such a case, we may not be able to recover our losses from the supplier. 
 
 17 

We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability claims and recalls. 
 
 We face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in personal injury and/or property damage. If we manufacture a defective product or if component failures result in damages that are not covered by warranty provisions, we may experience material product liability losses in the future. In addition, we may incur significant costs to defend product liability claims. We could also incur damages and significant costs in correcting any defects, lose sales and suffer damage to our reputation. Our product liability insurance coverage may not be adequate for all liabilities we could incur and may not continue to be available in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. Significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, the adverse publicity that may result from a product liability claim or perceived or actual defect with our products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully. 
 
 We are subject to potential recalls of our products from customers to cure manufacturing defects or in the event of a failure to comply with customers order specifications or applicable regulatory standards, as well as potential recalls of components or parts manufactured by suppliers that we purchase and incorporate into our school buses. We may also be required to remedy or retrofit buses in the event that an order is not built to a customer s specifications or where a design error has been made. Significant retrofit and remediation costs or product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 A failure to renew dealer agreements or cancellation of, or significant delay in, new bus orders may result in unexpected declines in revenue and profitability. 
 
 We rely to a significant extent on our dealers to sell our products to the end consumer. A loss of one or more significant dealers or a reduction in the market share of existing dealers would lead to a loss of revenues that could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 
 Our dealer agreements are typically for a five-year term; however, the dealer can usually cancel the agreement for convenience without penalty upon 90 days notice. While most of our dealers have been purchasing from us for more than two decades, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to renew our dealer agreements on favorable terms, or at all, at their scheduled expiration dates. If we are unable to renew a contract with one or more of our significant dealers, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected until an alternative solution is implemented (e.g., a new dealer or combining the territory with another, existing Blue Bird dealer). If dealer agreements are terminated with one or more of our top 10 dealers, significant orders are canceled or delayed or we incur a significant decrease in the level of purchases from any of our top 10 dealers, our sales and operating results would be adversely impacted. In addition, our new bus orders are subject to potential reduction, cancellation and/or significant delay. Although dealers generally only order buses from us after they have a firm order from a school district, orders for buses are also generally cancellable until 14 weeks prior to delivery. 
 
 Changes in laws or regulations related to the manufacture of school buses, or a failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments, including non-U.S. governments, related to the manufacture of our school buses. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Our products must satisfy a complex compliance scheme due to variability in and potentially conflicting local, state, federal and international laws and regulations. The cost of compliance may be substantial in a period due to the potential for modification or customization of our school buses in any of the 50 plus jurisdictions in which our buses are sold. In addition, if we expand into more international jurisdictions, we could potentially incur additional costs in order to tailor our products to the applicable local law requirements of such jurisdictions. Further, we must comply with additional regulatory requirements applicable to us as a federal contractor for our GSA contracts, which increase our costs. GSA contracts are also subject to audit and increased inspections and costs of compliance. Any potential penalties for non-compliance with laws and regulations may not be covered by insurance that we carry. 
 
 Environmental obligations and liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial condition, cash flows and profitability. 
 
 Potential environmental issues have been identified at our facility in Fort Valley, Georgia, including the solid waste management units at the facility s old landfill. Potential remediation costs and obligations could require the expenditure of capital and, if greater than expected, or in excess of applicable insurance coverage, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. We are cooperating with the Georgia Environmental Protection Division and have conducted a site-wide investigation under the current hazardous waste management law. All investigations of suspect areas have been completed. Implementation of a corrective action plan has commenced, which will consist of re-surfacing the landfill cap, ongoing monitoring, and ground water use restrictions for the old landfill. There are currently no proposed remediation actions to be included in the 
 18 

corrective action plan. Based on the data generated from the latest site investigation, we believe our environmental risks have been reduced substantially, but not eliminated. 
 
 Our future competitiveness and ability to achieve long-term profitability depend on our ability to control costs, which requires us to improve our organization continuously and to increase operating efficiencies and reduce costs. 
 
 In order to operate profitably in our market, we are continually transforming our organization and rationalizing our operating processes. Our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiatives throughout our operations. While some of the elements of cost reduction are within our control, others, such as commodity costs, regulatory costs and labor costs, depend more on external factors, and there can be no assurance that such external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our costs. 
 
 Our operating results may vary widely from period to period due to the sales cycle, seasonal fluctuations and other factors. 
 
 Our orders with our dealers and customers generally require time-consuming customization and specification. We incur significant operating expenses when we are building a bus prior to sale or designing and testing a new bus. If there are delays in the sale of buses to dealers or customers, such delays may lead to significant fluctuations in results of operations from quarter to quarter, making it difficult to predict our financial performance on a quarterly basis. Further, if we were to experience a significant amount of cancellations of or reductions in purchase orders, it would reduce our future sales and results of operations. 
 
 Our business is subject to seasonal and other fluctuations. In particular, we have historically experienced higher revenues during the third and fourth quarters when compared with the first and second quarters during each fiscal year. This seasonality is caused primarily by school districts ordering more school buses prior to the beginning of a school year. Our ability to meet customer delivery schedules is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, access to components and raw materials, an adequate and capable workforce, assembling/engineering expertise for certain projects and sufficient manufacturing capacity. The availability of these factors may in some cases be subject to conditions outside of our control. A failure to deliver in accordance with our performance obligations may result in financial penalties under certain of our GSA contracts and damage to existing customer relationships, damage to our reputation and a loss of future bidding opportunities, which could cause the loss of future business and could negatively impact our financial performance. 
 
 Our defined benefit pension plan is currently underfunded and pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors, including weak performance of financial markets, decreasing interest rates and investments that do not achieve adequate returns. 
 
 Our defined benefit pension plan currently holds a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities. Our future funding requirement for our frozen defined benefit pension plan Pension Plan qualified with the Internal Revenue Service depends upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for this plan, the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels, the level of benefits provided for by the Pension Plan and any changes in government laws and regulations. Future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns, as other factors are held constant. If future funding requirements increase, we would be required to contribute more funds, which would negatively impact our cash flows. 
 
 Our current or future indebtedness could impair our financial condition and reduce the funds available to us for growth or other purposes. Our debt agreements impose certain operating and financial restrictions, with which failure to comply could result in an event of default that could adversely affect our business. 
 
 We have substantial indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund the interest payments on our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and other debt service obligations and keep us in compliance with the covenants under our debt agreements or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We can provide no assurance that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, which may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs; obtain standby letters of credit, bank guarantees or performance bonds required to bid on or secure certain customer contracts; make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances; withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general; engage in business activities, including future opportunities for growth, that may be in our interest; and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. 
 
 If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, or if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements, we will be in default and, as a result, our lenders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, could terminate their 
 19 

commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing our borrowings, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. 
 
 In addition, we and certain of our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness, including additional secured and/or unsecured indebtedness. Although the terms of our debt agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant. Incurring additional indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness, including our ability to service our indebtedness. 
 
 Our profitability depends on achieving certain minimum school bus sales volumes and margins. If school bus sales deteriorate, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows will suffer. 
 
 Our profitability requires us to maintain certain minimum school bus sales volumes and margins. As is typical for a vehicle manufacturer, we have significant fixed costs and, therefore, changes in our school bus sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on profitability. If our school bus sales decline to levels significantly below our assumptions, due to a financial downturn, recessionary conditions, changes in consumer confidence, geopolitical events, inability to secure an adequate supply of critical components or any other reason that would limit our ability to produce sufficient quantities of school buses, limited access to financing or other factors, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially adversely affected. 
 
 If Huntington Distribution Finance, Inc. cannot provide financial services to our dealers and customers to acquire our products, our sales and results of operations could deteriorate. 
 
 Our dealers and customers benefit from their relationships with Huntington, which provides (i) floorplan financing for certain of our network dealers and (ii) a modest amount of vehicle lease financing to school districts. Although we neither assume any balance sheet risk nor receive any direct economic benefit from Huntington, we could be materially adversely affected if Huntington was unable to provide this financing and our dealers were unable to obtain alternate financing, at least until a replacement for Huntington was identified. Huntington faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations and its ability to provide financing and leasing to our dealers and customers. Because Huntington serves as an additional source of leasing and financing options for dealers and customers, an impairment of Huntington s ability to provide such financial services could negatively affect our efforts to expand our market penetration among customers that rely on these financial services to acquire new school buses and dealers that seek financing. 
 
 We rely heavily on trade secrets to gain a competitive advantage in the market and the unenforceability of our nondisclosure agreements may adversely affect our operations. 
 
 Historically, we have not relied upon patents to protect our design or manufacturing processes or products. Instead, we rely significantly on maintaining the confidentiality of our trade secrets and other information related to our operations. Accordingly, we require all executives, engineering employees and suppliers to sign a nondisclosure agreement to protect our trade secrets, business strategy and other proprietary information. If the provisions of these agreements are found unenforceable in any jurisdiction in which we operate, the disclosure of our proprietary information may place us at a competitive disadvantage. Even where the provisions are enforceable, the confidentiality clauses may not provide adequate protection of our trade secrets and proprietary information in every such jurisdiction. 
 
 We require training sessions for our employees regarding the protection of our trade secrets, business strategy and other proprietary information. Our employee training may not provide adequate protection of our trade secrets and proprietary information. 
 
 We may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property rights, including trade secrets and know-how, without our authorization or from independently developing intellectual property that is the same as or similar to our intellectual property, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the U.S. The unauthorized use of our trade secrets or know-how by third parties could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business or increase our expenses as we attempt to enforce our rights. 
 
 Our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. 
 
 We rely on a number of significant unregistered trademarks and other unregistered intellectual property in the day-to-day operation of our business. Without the protections afforded by registration, our ability to protect and use our trademarks and other unregistered intellectual property may be limited, which could negatively affect our business in the future. In addition, while we have not faced intellectual property infringement claims from others in recent years, in the event successful infringement claims are brought against 
 20 

us, particularly claims (under patents or otherwise) against our product design or manufacturing processes, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. 
 
 Our business could be materially adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 We sell the majority of our buses and parts in U.S. Dollars. Our foreign customers have exposures to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our sales in that region. Foreign currency exchange rates can have material adverse effects on our foreign customers' ability to purchase our products. Further, we have certain sales contracts that are transacted in Canadian Dollars. While we generally aim to hedge any such transactions, that may not always be the case. As a result, foreign currency fluctuations and the associated remeasurements and translations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The manufacture of our Type A buses is conducted by the Micro Bird joint venture that we do not control and cannot operate solely for our benefit. 
 
 The manufacture of Type A buses is carried out by a 50/50 Canadian joint venture, Micro Bird, which we do not control or consolidate. In joint ventures, we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. In joint ventures, we are required to foster our relationships with co-owners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes or relationships deteriorate, our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected. The benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so that we do not receive all the benefits from our joint venture. 
 
 General Risk Factors 
 
 The inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 
 Our ability to operate our business and implement our strategies depends, in part, on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including manufacturing personnel, sales professionals and engineers. The unexpected loss of services of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business. 
 
 While we have enjoyed good relations and a collaborative approach with our work force, employment relationships can deteriorate over time. Given the extent to which we rely on our employees, any significant deterioration in our relationships with our key employees or overall workforce could materially harm us. Work stoppages or instability in our relationships with our employees could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues that would adversely affect our operations. In addition, local economic conditions in the Central Georgia area (where our principal manufacturing facilities are located) may impact our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. 
 
 The ability to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement on terms that are favorable to the Company is uncertain and the final terms of, and costs associated with, the collective bargaining agreement could adversely affect our business, cash flow, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The Company's business is labor intensive. As a result of the USW election, a large majority of our workforce is now represented by a labor union. The Company expects to negotiate in good faith toward a collective bargaining agreement, and any such resulting agreement may cause it to incur higher labor costs for our employees than we would have incurred absent such agreement. At this time, it is uncertain as to when and if an agreement with the USW will be reached. As such, uncertainty exists regarding labor costs and labor actions, which may include increased labor costs, strikes, work stoppages, unfair labor practices claims and other disturbances and disputes. 
 
 Union actions that may occur in the future could cause disruptions to our operations and may cause us to incur additional costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Our worker s compensation insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. 
 
 Although we maintain a workers compensation insurance stop loss policy to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur resulting from work-related injuries to our employees over our self-insured limit, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities as we incur the costs and expenses up to our self-insured limit. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order 
 21 

to comply with current or future health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may negatively impact our manufacturing operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. 
 
 We may need additional financing to execute our business plan and fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. 
 
 Our ability to execute current and future business plans, including the potential for future market and/or product expansion and opportunities for future international growth, may require substantial additional capital. We will consider raising additional funds through various financing sources, including the sale of our equity securities or the procurement of additional commercial debt financing. However, there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to execute our growth strategy, and operating results may be adversely affected. Any additional debt financing will increase expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results and may involve restrictions limiting our operating flexibility. If we issue equity securities to raise additional funds, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced, and our stockholders may experience additional dilution in net book value per share. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our revenues from operations, are not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may be required to decrease the pace of, or eliminate, our future product offerings and market expansion opportunities and potentially curtail operations. 
 
 Interest rates could change substantially, materially impacting our profitability. 
 
 Our borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable market rates and expose us to interest rate risk. We monitor and manage this exposure as part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of interest rates and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our business. However, changes in interest rates cannot always be predicted, hedged, or offset with price increases to eliminate earnings volatility. 
 
 An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our operating results. 
 
 We have a substantial amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet, concentrated in our bus segment and specifically related to the dealer network and our trade name. These long-lived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if potential interim indicators exist that could result in impairment. If any business conditions or other factors cause profitability or cash flows to significantly decline, we may be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which could adversely affect our operating results. Events and conditions that could result in impairment include a prolonged period of global economic weakness, a further decline in economic conditions or a slow, weak economic recovery, sustained declines in the price of our common stock, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, adverse changes in the market share of our products, adverse changes in interest rates or other factors leading to reductions in the long-term sales or profitability that we expect. 
 
 Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems could substantially interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of our proprietary information, notwithstanding the fact that no such breaches or disruptions have materially impacted us to date. 
 
 We rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain management, manufacturing, invoicing and collection of payments from our dealer network and customers.

Other Risk Factors Relating to an Investment in Our Common Stock 
 
 Our only significant asset is ownership of 100 of the capital stock of School Bus Holdings and we do not currently intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Consequently, stockholders' ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock. 
 
 We have no direct operations and no significant assets other than the ownership of 100 of the capital stock of School Bus Holdings. We depend on School Bus Holdings and its subsidiaries for distributions, loans and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, including our expenses as a publicly traded company, and to pay any dividends with respect to our common stock, if any. Legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing our current indebtedness, as well as our financial condition and operating requirements, may limit our ability to obtain cash from School Bus Holdings and its subsidiaries. While we are permitted to pay dividends in certain circumstances under our credit facility, as long as we are in compliance with our obligations under the credit facility, we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any future dividend payments are within the absolute discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of dividends, business opportunities, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. 
 
 Concentration of ownership of our common stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. 
 
 At September 30, 2023, approximately 20 of our common stock was owned by ASP, an affiliate of American Securities LLC ("American Securities"). As a result, American Securities has the ability to significantly influence the outcome of corporate actions of our Company requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 
 Shares of our common stock are reserved for current and future issuance, which would have the effect of diluting the existing shareholders. 
 
 On May 28, 2015 and March 12, 2020, we registered 3,700,000 and 1,500,000 common stock shares, respectively, representing the shares of common stock issuable under the Blue Bird Corporation 2015 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the Incentive Plan and, pursuant to Rule 416(c) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, an indeterminable number of additional shares of common stock issuable under the Incentive Plan, as such amount may be adjusted as a result of stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, anti-dilution provisions and similar transactions. At September 30, 2023, there were 718,034 common stock shares remaining to be issued under the Incentive Plan. 
 
 On December 15, 2021, we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate 4,687,500 shares of our common stock at 16.00 per share. The approximate 74.8 million of net proceeds that we received from this transaction were used to repay outstanding revolving borrowings as required by the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement (defined below), which increased the available borrowing capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility (defined below) that could be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, investments in technologies or businesses, operating expenses and capital expenditures. 
 
 Additionally, on November 16, 2021, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 that allows the Company to sell up to 200.0 million in the aggregate of any combination of several different types of securities, including shares of common stock, from time to time in one or more offerings. The number of shares is indeterminable and is dependent on whether or not common stock is a security being sold in a future offering and, if so, the amount of capital we are attempting to raise and the price at which the shares of common stock can be sold. Any such sale of shares may also be adjusted as a result of stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, anti-dilution provisions and similar transactions. 
 
 Anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt. 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include: 
 
 no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; 
 
 the exclusive right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director with or without cause by stockholders, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors; 
 
 23 

subject to any rights of holders of existing preferred shares, if any, the ability of our Board of Directors to determine whether to issue shares of our preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer; 
 
 a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders; 
 
 the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, or the Board of Directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; 
 
 limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers; 
 
 controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings; 
 
 providing for a staggered board, in which the members of the Board of Directors are divided into three classes to serve for a period of three years from the date of their respective appointment or election; 
 
 permitting the removal of directors with or without cause by stockholders voting a majority of the votes cast if, at any time and for so long as, American Securities beneficially owns, in the aggregate, capital stock representing at least 40 of the outstanding shares of our common stock; 
 
 advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our Company; 
 
 requiring an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of our entire Board of Directors and by the holders of at least 66.67 of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock in order to adopt an amendment to our certificate of incorporation if, at any time and for so long as, American Securities beneficially owns, in the aggregate, capital stock representing at least 50 of the outstanding shares of our common stock; and 
 
 requiring an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of our entire Board of Directors or by the holders of at least 66.67 of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock to amend our bylaws if, at any time and for so long as, American Securities beneficially owns, in the aggregate, capital stock representing at least 50 of the outstanding shares of our common stock. 
 
 These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our Company or changes in our Board of Directors and management. 
 
 As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.

 Other than Lion Electric Company, Blue Bird is the only publicly traded school bus company. As such, our peer group is not constructed on a line-of-business basis. Given our business model and brand recognition, we believe that the specialty vehicle OEMs and branded industrial companies that we have selected represent the most comparable publicly traded companies to Blue Bird. While Lion Electric Company is within Blue Bird's peer group, it is not included in the chart above as it has only been publicly traded since May 2021. Additionally, NFI Group Inc. is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canadian Dollars. The hypothetical investment in NFI Group Inc. assumes investing 100 U.S. Dollars to acquire shares on September 29, 2018. The value of such shares at each of the above dates is then translated from Canadian Dollars to U.S. Dollars for inclusion in the peer group index.

Executive Overview 
 
 Blue Bird is the leading independent designer and manufacturer of school buses. Our longevity and reputation in the school bus industry have made Blue Bird an iconic American brand. We distinguish ourselves from our principal competitors by dedicating our focus to the design, engineering, manufacture and sale of school buses, and related parts. As the principal manufacturer of chassis and body production specifically designed for school bus applications in the U.S., Blue Bird is recognized as an industry leader for school bus innovation, safety, product quality/reliability/durability and, during more normal times, efficiency and lower operating costs. In addition, Blue Bird is the market leader in alternative powered product offerings with its propane, gasoline and electric powered school buses. 
 
 Blue Bird sells its buses and parts through an extensive network of U.S. and Canadian dealers that, in their territories, are exclusive to Blue Bird on Type C and Type D school buses. Blue Bird also sells directly to major fleet operators, the U.S. Government, state governments, and authorized dealers in certain limited foreign countries. 
 
 Impacts of COVID-19 and Subsequent Supply Chain Constraints on Our Business 
 
 Beginning in our second quarter of fiscal 2020, COVID-19 began to spread throughout the world, resulting in a global pandemic. The pandemic triggered a significant downturn in global commerce as early as February 2020 and the challenging market conditions continued into the early months of calendar year 2021. Countermeasures taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic included virtual and hybrid schooling in many jurisdictions throughout the U.S. and Canada. The uncertainty of when and how schools would open materially affected demand within the Type C and Type D school bus industry in the second half of the Company's fiscal 2020. 
 
 While demand for school buses remained suppressed during the first half of fiscal 2021 as a result of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it strengthened substantially during the second half of the fiscal year as COVID-19 vaccines were administered and many jurisdictions began preparing for a return to in-person learning environments for the new school year that began in mid-August to early September 2021. However, during the second half of fiscal 2021, the Company, and automotive industry as a whole, began experiencing significant supply chain constraints resulting from, among others, labor shortages due to the great resignation; the lack of maintenance on, and acquisition of, capital assets during the extended COVID-19 global lockdowns; significant increased demand for consumer products containing certain materials required for the production of vehicles, such as microchips, as consumers spent stimulus and other funds on items for their homes; etc. These supply chain disruptions had a significant adverse impact our operations and results due to higher purchasing costs, including freight costs incurred to expedite receipt of critical components, increased manufacturing inefficiencies and our inability to complete the production of buses to fulfill sales orders primarily during the latter half of fiscal 2021 and most of fiscal 2022. Specifically, management estimates that the sale of approximately 2,000 units was deferred from fiscal 2021 into fiscal 2022 as a result of the shortage of critical components that prevented the Company from initiating or completing, as applicable, the production process for certain units that were otherwise scheduled to be delivered to customers during the year. Including these units, the Company's backlog exceeded 4,200 units as of October 2, 2021. 
 
 Although there were pockets of COVID-19 outbreaks in the U.S. throughout fiscal 2022, most school systems maintained partial or full in-person learning environments for the entirety of the school year. Accordingly, new bus orders during fiscal 2022 remained extremely robust, primarily due to pent-up demand resulting from the cumulative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic when many school systems conducted virtual learning (i.e., approximately January 2020 through June 2021). This strong demand, when coupled with an already challenged global supply chain for automotive parts that continued from fiscal 2021 but that was further impacted, including continuing escalating inventory purchase costs, by additional stress resulting from Russia s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 (see further discussion below) and several complete shutdowns in China as a result of widespread COVID-19 outbreaks, resulted in the Company s order backlog continuing to grow during fiscal 2022, exceeding 5,000 units as of October 1, 2022 (only minimal sales orders were canceled during the fiscal year as a result of continued delays in our production process). 
 
 Shortages of key components during the second half of fiscal 2021 and most of fiscal 2022 hindered the Company's ability to complete the production of buses to fulfill sales orders, which had a significant, adverse impact on the Company's revenues during these periods. The Company also experienced significant increased purchase costs for many of its raw materials as a result of supply chain disruptions over these same periods and continuing, to a lesser extent, into fiscal 2023 that have negatively impacted the gross profit it recognized on sales. In response, beginning in July 2021 and continuing throughout fiscal 2022, the Company announced a number of 
 28 

sales price increases that applied to new sales orders and partially applied to backlog orders that were both intended to mitigate the impact of rising purchase costs on our operations and results. Additionally, during fiscal 2022, the Company began including price escalation provisions when bidding on contracts so that it could consider economic fluctuations between the bid date and the contract date to determine whether increased costs should be passed along to customers. Most of these price increases were generally not realized in the first half of fiscal 2022 as sales recorded during such quarters related to the backlog of orders that existed prior, and therefore were not subject, to the price increases. While they began to impact sales and gross profit in the latter half of fiscal 2022, such impact did not offset the significant continued increase in the Company's production costs, resulting in further deterioration of the Company's gross profit during the second half of fiscal 2022 and continuing into the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as it produced and sold the oldest units included in the backlog as of the end of fiscal 2022. However, they had a positive impact on sales and gross profit during the remainder of fiscal 2023, as the Company fulfilled sales orders (i) from the backlog existing as of the end of fiscal 2022 and (ii) that were taken during fiscal 2023, both of which contained most or all of the cumulative sales price increases that have been announced since July 2021. 
 
 New bus orders during fiscal 2023 remained robust, primarily due to a combination of (i) pent-up demand resulting from the cumulative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic when many school systems conducted virtual learning and (ii) the challenged global supply chain for automotive parts that hindered the school bus industry's ability to produce and sell buses during the latter half of fiscal 2021 and most of fiscal 2022. Accordingly, the Company's backlog remained strong at approximately 4,600 units as of September 30, 2023 despite it selling over 8,500 units during fiscal 2023, the majority of which were included in the backlog that existed as of October 1, 2022. 
 
 In general, management believes that supply chain disruptions could continue in future periods and could materially impact our results if we are unable to i) obtain parts and supplies in sufficient quantities to meet our production needs and/or ii) pass along rising costs to our customers. Additionally, although we have not experienced any pervasive COVID-19 illnesses to date, if we were to experience some form of outbreak within our facilities, we would take all appropriate measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, which could include a temporary halt in production. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply chain constraints have resulted, and could continue to result, in significant economic disruption and have adversely affected our business. They could adversely impact our business in fiscal 2024 and perhaps beyond. Significant uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of any future COVID-19 outbreaks and their potential impact on the overall economy, both within the U.S and globally. Accordingly, the magnitude and duration of any demand reductions, production and supply chain disruptions, and related financial impacts on our business cannot be estimated at this time. 
 
 The impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply chain constraints on the Company's business and operations during the second half of fiscal 2020 and continuing into fiscal 2023 negatively affected our revenues, gross profit, income and cash flows. We continue to monitor and assess the level of future customer demand, the ability of school boards to maintain normal in-person learning in the foreseeable future, the ability of suppliers to maintain operations and to provide parts and supplies in sufficient quantities to meet our production needs, the ability of our employees to continue to work, and our ability to maintain continuous production. See PART I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors," of this Report for a discussion of the material risks we believe we face particularly related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Impact of Russia s Invasion of Ukraine on Our Business 
 
 On February 24, 2022, Russian military forces launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. While the Company has no assets or customers in either of these countries, this military conflict has had a significant negative impact on the Company s operations, cash flows and results during fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, primarily in an indirect manner since the Company does not sell to customers located in, or source goods directly from, either country. 
 
 Specifically, Ukraine has historically been a large exporter of ferroalloy materials used in the manufacture of steel and the disruption in the supply of these minerals resulted in a significant increase in the price of steel from 1,057 per ton the third week of February 2022 to as high as 1,492 per ton the third week of April 2022 before finally decreasing to an average of 1,078 per ton the last two weeks of June 2022 and continuing to decline to 791 per ton the last week in September 2022. During fiscal 2023, the decrease in the price of steel continued during the first quarter to 664 per ton the last week in December 2022 but began to increase significantly during the second quarter to 1,152 per ton the last week in March 2023 before slowly decreasing during the third and fourth quarters to 878 and 666 per ton the last weeks in June 2023 and September 2023, respectively (source for all per ton prices: sheet prices published by the CRU Index every Wednesday that provide price benchmarking in North America for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel). While the Company has generally mitigated its direct exposure to steel prices by executing fixed price purchase contracts (generally purchased up to four quarters in advance) for the majority of the significant amount of steel used in the manufacture of school bus bodies, many suppliers from which the Company purchases components containing steel increased the price that they charge the Company to acquire such inventory, primarily on a lagged basis, during the latter half of fiscal 2022 and into 
 29 

fiscal 2023, as applicable. These inventory costs impact gross profit when school buses are sold and cash flows when the related invoices are paid. 
 
 Additionally, Russia has historically been a large global exporter of oil and many countries have ceased buying Russian oil in protest of the invasion and to comply with sanctions imposed by the U.S. and many European countries. Accordingly, the disruption in the supply of oil has significantly impacted the price of goods refined from oil, such as diesel fuel, which increased from 4.055 per gallon the week ending February 21, 2022 to as high as 5.810 per gallon the week ending June 20, 2022, before decreasing slightly throughout the remainder of our fiscal 2022 to 4.889 per gallon the week ending September 26, 2022 and fluctuating within a range from 5.341 and 3.767 per gallon during fiscal 2023 (source: U.S Energy Information Administration - Weekly U.S. No 2 Diesel Retail Prices). These increases have significantly impacted the Company both as a result of the price that suppliers charge the Company to acquire inventory (since diesel fuel impacts their cost of acquiring the inventory used in producing their goods) and the price that the Company pays for freight to deliver the inventory that it acquires. Additionally, such increases are generally implemented with very little lag so that they impact the purchase cost of inventory and cash flows on an almost real-time basis. 
 
 Finally, both countries have large quantities of other minerals that impact commodity costs, such as rubber and resin, among others, and the disruption caused by the ongoing military conflict has increased the cost and/or decreased the supply of components containing these materials, further impacting an already challenged global supply chain for automotive parts. 
 
 Russia s invasion of Ukraine has resulted, and is likely to continue to result, in significant economic disruption and has adversely affected our business. Specifically, it has contributed to higher inventory purchase costs, including freight costs, that negatively impacted the gross profit recognized on sales during the latter part of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023. Because peace negotiations do not appear to be productive and because Russia has announced its intention to continue military operations in Ukraine in the immediate term, we currently believe that this matter will continue to adversely impact our business into fiscal 2024 and perhaps beyond. Significant uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the ongoing military conflict and its impact on the overall economy, both within the U.S. and globally. Accordingly, the duration of any production and supply chain disruptions, and related financial impacts, cannot be estimated at this time. 
 
 Factors Affecting Our Revenues 
 
 Our revenues are driven primarily by the following factors: 
 
 Property tax revenues . Property tax revenues are one of the major sources of funding for school districts, and therefore new school buses. Property tax revenues are a function of land and building prices, based on assessments of property value by state or county assessors and millage rates voted by the local electorate. 
 Student enrollment and delivery mechanisms for learning . Increases or decreases in the number of school bus riders have a direct impact on school district demand. Evolving protocols for public health concerns and/or continued technological advancements could shift the future form of educational delivery away from in-person learning on a more permanent basis, with increased remote learning reasonably expected to decrease the number of school bus riders. 
 Revenue mix . We are able to charge more for certain of our products (e.g., Type C propane powered school buses, electric powered buses, Type D buses, and buses with higher option content) than other products. The mix of products sold in any fiscal period can directly impact our revenues for the period. 
 Strength of the dealer network . We rely on our dealers, as well as a small number of major fleet operators, to be the direct point of contact with school districts and their purchasing agents. An effective dealer is capable of expanding revenues within a given school district by matching that district s needs to our capabilities, offering options that would not otherwise be provided to the district. 
 Pricing . Our products are sold to school districts throughout the U.S. and Canada. Each state and each Canadian province has its own set of regulations that govern the purchase of products, including school buses, by their school districts. We and our dealers must navigate these regulations, purchasing procedures, and the districts specifications in order to reach mutually acceptable price terms. Pricing may or may not be favorable to us, depending upon a number of factors impacting purchasing decisions. Additionally, in certain cases, prices originally quoted with dealers and school districts may have become less favorable, or more unfavorable, to us given increasing inventory costs between the time the sales order was contractually agreed upon and the bus is built and delivered as a result of ongoing supply chain disruptions and general inflationary pressures. 
 Buying patterns of major fleets . Major fleets regularly compete against one another for existing accounts. Fleets are also continuously trying to win the business of school districts that operate their own transportation services. These activities can have either a positive or negative impact on our sales, depending on the brand preference of the fleet that wins the business. 
 30 

Major fleets also periodically review their fleet sizes and replacement patterns due to funding availability as well as the profitability of existing routes. These actions can impact total purchases by fleets in a given year. 
 Seasonality. Historically, our sales have been subject to seasonal variation based on the school calendar with the peak season during our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Sales during the third and fourth fiscal quarters are typically greater than the first and second fiscal quarters due to the desire of municipalities to have any new buses that they order available to them at the beginning of the new school year. With the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the demand for Company products and the impact of the subsequent supply chain constraints hindering the Company's ability to produce and sell buses, seasonality has become unpredictable. Seasonality and variations from historical seasonality have impacted the comparison of results between fiscal periods. 
 Inflation. As discussed previously above, supply chain disruptions developing subsequent to the COVID-19 pandemic and, more recently, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have significantly increased our inventory purchase costs, including freight costs incurred to expedite receipt of critical components, reflected in cost of goods sold during the latter half of fiscal 2021, all of fiscal 2022, and continuing, to a lesser extent, throughout fiscal 2023. In response, the Company announced a number of sales price increases that applied to new sales orders and partially applied to backlog orders that were both intended to mitigate the impact of rising purchase costs on our operations and results. Most of these price increases were generally not realized in the first half of fiscal 2022 as sales recorded during such quarters related to the backlog of orders that existed prior, and therefore were not subject, to the price increases. While they began to impact sales and gross profit in the latter half of fiscal 2022, such impact did not offset the significant continued increase in the Company's production costs, resulting in further deterioration of the Company's gross profit during the second half of fiscal 2022 and continuing into the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as it produced and sold the oldest units included in the backlog as of the end of fiscal 2022. However, they had a positive impact on sales and gross profit during the remainder of fiscal 2023, as the Company fulfilled sales orders (i) from the backlog existing as of the end of fiscal 2022 that originated more recently (i.e., during the latter months of fiscal 2022) and (ii) that were taken during fiscal 2023, both of which contained most or all of the cumulative sales price increases that have been announced since July 2021. 
 
 F actors Affecting Our Expenses and Other Items 
 
 Our expenses and other line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations are principally driven by the following factors: 
 
 Cost of goods sold . The components of our cost of goods sold consist of material costs (principally powertrain components, steel and rubber, as well as aluminum and copper) including freight costs, labor expense, and overhead. Our cost of goods sold may vary from period to period due to changes in sales volume, efforts by certain suppliers to pass through the economics associated with key commodities, fluctuations in freight costs, design changes with respect to specific components, design changes with respect to specific bus models, wage increases for plant labor, productivity of plant labor, delays in receiving materials and other logistical challenges, and the impact of overhead items such as utilities. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses . Our selling, general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our selling and marketing efforts, engineering, centralized finance, human resources, purchasing, and information technology services, along with other administrative matters and functions. In most instances, other than direct costs associated with sales and marketing programs, the principal component of these costs is salary expense. Changes from period to period are typically driven by the number of our employees, as well as by merit increases provided to experienced personnel. 
 Interest expense . Our interest expense relates to costs associated with our debt instruments and reflects both the amount of indebtedness and the interest rate that we are required to pay on our debt. Interest expense also includes unrealized gains or losses from interest rate hedges, if any, and changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships, if any, as well as expenses related to debt guarantees, if any. 
 Income taxes . We make estimates of the amounts to recognize for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. In addition, provisions are established for withholding taxes related to the transfer of cash between jurisdictions and for uncertain tax positions taken. 
 Other income/expense, net . This balance includes periodic pension expense or income as well as gains or losses on foreign currency, if any. Other amounts not associated with operating expenses may also be included in this balance. 
 Equity in net income or loss of non-consolidated affiliate . We include in this line item our 50 share of net income or loss from our investment in Micro Bird, our unconsolidated Canadian joint venture. 

Key Non-GAAP Financial Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Performance 
 
 The consolidated financial statements included in this Report in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. U.S. GAAP ). This Report also includes the following 
 31 

financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP ("non-GAAP"): Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Free Cash Flow. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are financial metrics that are utilized by management and the Board of Directors to determine (a) the annual cash bonus payouts, if any, to be made to certain members of management based upon the terms of the Company s Management Incentive Plan, and (b) whether the performance criteria have been met for the vesting of certain equity awards granted annually to certain members of management based upon the terms of the Company s Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan. Additionally, consolidated EBITDA, which is an adjusted EBITDA metric defined by our Amended Credit Agreement (defined below) that could differ from Adjusted EBITDA discussed above as the adjustments to the calculations are not uniform, is used to determine the Company's ongoing compliance with several financial covenant requirements, including being utilized in the denominator of the calculation of the TNLR, as and when applicable, which is also utilized in determining the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement or 2023 Credit Agreement, as applicable (both defined below). Accordingly, management views these non-GAAP financial metrics as key for the above purposes and as a useful way to evaluate the performance of our operations as discussed further below. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss prior to interest income; interest expense including the component of operating lease expense (which is presented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in our U.S. GAAP financial statements) that represents interest expense on lease liabilities; income taxes; and depreciation and amortization including the component of operating lease expense (which is presented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in our U.S. GAAP financial statements) that represents amortization charges on right-of-use lease assets; as adjusted for certain non-cash charges or credits that we may record on a recurring basis such as share-based compensation expense and unrealized gains or losses on certain derivative financial instruments; net gains or losses on the disposal of assets as well as certain charges such as (i) significant product design changes; (ii) transaction related costs; (iii) discrete expenses related to major cost cutting and/or operational transformation initiatives; or (iv) costs directly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. While certain of the charges that are added back in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation, such as transaction related costs and operational transformation and major product redesign initiatives, represent operating expenses that may be recorded in more than one annual period, the significant project or transaction giving rise to such expenses is not considered to be indicative of the Company s normal operations. Accordingly, we believe that these, as well as the other credits and charges that comprise the amounts utilized in the determination of Adjusted EBITDA described above, should not be used in evaluating the Company s ongoing annual operating performance. 
 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of performance defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The measures are used as a supplement to U.S. GAAP results in evaluating certain aspects of our business, as described below. 
 
 We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because the measures consider the performance of our ongoing operations, excluding decisions made with respect to capital investment, financing, and certain other significant initiatives or transactions as outlined in the preceding paragraph. We believe the non-GAAP measures offer additional financial metrics that, when coupled with the U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of our results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss as an indicator of our performance or as alternatives to any other measure prescribed by U.S. GAAP as there are limitations to using such non-GAAP measures. Although we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may enhance an evaluation of our operating performance based on recent revenue generation and product/overhead cost control because they exclude the impact of prior decisions made about capital investment, financing, and certain other significant initiatives or transactions, (i) other companies in Blue Bird s industry may define Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin differently than we do and, as a result, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in Blue Bird s industry, and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin exclude certain financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. 
 
 We compensate for these limitations by providing disclosure of the differences between Adjusted EBITDA and U.S. GAAP results, including providing a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP results, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of our ongoing operating results. 
 
 Our measure of Free Cash Flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and it should not be relied upon to the exclusion of U.S. GAAP financial measures. Free Cash Flow reflects an additional way of evaluating our liquidity that, when viewed with our U.S. GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 
 
 We define Free Cash Flow as total cash provided by/used in operating activities as adjusted for net cash paid for the acquisition of fixed assets and intangible assets. We use Free Cash Flow, and ratios based on Free Cash Flow, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since purchases 
 32 

of fixed assets and intangible assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. Accordingly, we expect Free Cash Flow to be less than operating cash flows. 
 
 Our Segments 
 
 We manage our business in two operating segments, which are also our reportable segments: (i) the Bus segment, which involves the design, engineering, manufacture and sale of school buses and extended warranties; and (ii) the Parts segment, which includes the sale of replacement bus parts. Financial information is reported on the basis that it is used internally by the chief operating decision maker CODM in evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments. The Chief Executive Officer of the Company has been identified as the CODM. Management evaluates the segments based primarily upon revenues and gross profit.

 The following provides the results of operations of Blue Bird's two reportable segments: 
 (in thousands) 2023 2022 Net Sales by Segment 
 Bus 
 1,034,625 723,505 Parts 
 98,168 77,132 Total 1,132,793 800,637 Gross Profit by Segment

 91,003 5,065 Parts 
 47,847 31,481 Total 
 138,850 36,546 
 
 Net sales . Net sales were 1,132.8 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of 332.2 million, or 41.5 , compared to 800.6 million for fiscal 2022. The increase in net sales is primarily due to increased unit bookings, product and mix changes, as well as pricing actions taken by management in response to increased inventory purchase costs. Significant supply chain disruptions began limiting the availability of certain critical components primarily beginning towards the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and continuing throughout fiscal 2022. However, during fiscal 2023, supply chain constraints began to improve slightly, allowing for increased production during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. 
 
 33 

Bus sales increased 311.1 million, or 43.0 , reflecting an increase in units booked and a 14.6 increase in average sales price per unit. In fiscal 2023, 8,514 units were booked compared to 6,822 units booked for fiscal 2022. The increase in units sold was primarily due to constraints in the Company's ability to produce and deliver buses due to shortages of critical components in fiscal 2022. The 14.6 increase in average sales price per unit reflects pricing actions taken by management as well as product and customer mix changes. 
 
 Parts sales increased 21.0 million, or 27.3 , for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. This increase is primarily attributed to pricing actions taken by management to offset increases in purchased parts costs and increased inventory availability as supply chain constraints began to improve during fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022. 
 
 Cost of goods sold . Total cost of goods sold was 993.9 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of 229.9 million, or 30.1 , compared to 764.1 million for fiscal 2022. As a percentage of net sales, total cost of goods sold decreased from 95.4 to 87.7 . 
 
 Bus segment cost of goods sold increased 225.2 million, or 31.3 , for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the 24.8 increase in units booked during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Also contributing was increased inventory costs, as the average cost of goods sold per unit for fiscal 2023 was 5.2 higher compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to increases in manufacturing costs attributable to a) increased raw materials costs resulting from ongoing inflationary pressures and b) ongoing supply chain disruptions that resulted in higher purchase costs for components and freight. 
 
 The 4.7 million, or 10.2 , increase in parts segment cost of goods sold for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to increased purchased parts costs, driven by ongoing inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, as well as slight variations due to product and channel mix. 
 
 Operating profit (loss) . Operating profit was 51.7 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of 92.4 million, or 226.9 , compared to 40.7 million of operating loss for fiscal 2022. Profitability was primarily impacted by an increase of 102.3 million in gross profit, as outlined in the revenue and cost of goods sold discussions above. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase of 9.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to an increase in labor costs. 
 
 Interest expense . Interest expense was 18.0 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of 3.3 million, or 22.7 , compared to 14.7 million for fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the stated term loan interest rate from 7.9 at October 1, 2022 to 10.0 at September 30, 2023 (which was higher for much of fiscal 2023 due to the spread we pay above the market rate, which is dependent on our TNLR at the end of each fiscal quarter), which was partially offset by lower borrowings during fiscal 2023 when compared with fiscal 2022. 
 
 Other expense/income, net. Other expense, net, was 8.3 million for fiscal 2023, a change of 11.3 million, or 381.9 , compared to 2.9 million of other income, net, in fiscal 2022. We recorded 0.7 million of net periodic pension expense during fiscal 2023 when compared with 3.0 million of net periodic pension income recorded during the fiscal 2022. 
 
 Additionally, on June 7, 2023, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with BofA Securities, Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters and American Securities LLC, Coliseum Capital Partners, L.P., and Blackwell Partners LLC Series A ("Selling Stockholders"), pursuant to which the Selling Stockholders agreed to sell 5,175,000 shares of common stock, including the sale of 675,000 shares pursuant to the underwriters exercise of their over-allotment option, at a purchase price of 20.00 per share. On September 11, 2023, the Company entered into another underwriting agreement with Barclays Capital, Inc., and the Selling Stockholders, pursuant to which the Selling Stockholders agreed to sell 2,500,000 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of 21.00 per share (collectively, "Offerings"). 
 
 The Offerings were conducted pursuant to prospectus supplements, dated June 7, 2023 and September 11, 2023, respectively, to the prospectus, dated December 22, 2021, included in the Company s registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-261858) that was initially filed with the SEC on December 23, 2021. 
 
 The Offerings closed on June 12, 2023 and September 14, 2023, respectively. Although the Company did not sell any shares or receive any proceeds from the Offerings, it was required to pay certain expenses in connection with the Offerings, which totaled 7.4 million during fiscal 2023, with no similar expense recorded during fiscal 2022. 
 
 Income taxes . Income tax expense was 9.0 million for fiscal 2023 compared to a benefit of 11.5 million for fiscal 2022. 
 
 The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 differed from the statutory Federal income tax rate of 21.0 . The increase in the effective tax rate to 34.7 was primarily due to the impacts of state taxes and certain permanent items on the Federal rate 
 
 34 

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 differed from the statutory Federal income tax rate of 21.0 . The increase in the effective tax rate to 21.6 was primarily due to the impacts of state taxes on the Federal rate. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA . Adjusted EBITDA was 87.9 million, or 7.8 of net sales, for fiscal 2023, an increase of 102.7 million, or 696.3 , compared to (14.7) million, or (1.8) of net sales, for fiscal 2022. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily the result of a 69.6 million increase in net income, as a result of the factors discussed above, the corresponding 20.4 million increase in income tax expense, the 7.4 million in stockholder transaction costs that were incurred in fiscal 2023 with no similar costs incurred in fiscal 2022 and the 5.5 million increase in Micro Bird's total interest expense, net; income tax expense or benefit; depreciation expense and amortization expense, which primarily resulted from a 4.2 million increase in income tax expense as a result of Micro Bird reporting net income during fiscal 2023 and a net loss in fiscal 2022. 
 
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years presented (note that the fiscal 2022 column has been recast to include our proportionate share of Micro Bird's interest expense, net; income tax expense or benefit; depreciation expense and amortization expense to conform with (i) similar adjustments made relating to the Company's operating results and (ii) the fiscal 2023 presentation included below):

 Net sales . Net sales were 800.6 million for fiscal 2022, an increase of 116.6 million, or 17.1 , compared to 684.0 million for fiscal 2021. The increase in net sales is primarily due to product and mix changes as well as pricing actions taken by management in response to increased inventory purchase costs. During the first half of fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic caused many schools to shut down in-person learning, decreasing the demand for buses and related maintenance and replacement parts. However, by the third quarter of fiscal 2021, many schools began signaling a return to in-person learning by the beginning of the 2021/2022 school year (i.e., August and September 2021), resulting in a significant increase in the demand for buses and a corresponding increase in our net sales during the second half of fiscal 2021. Although schools generally continued to conduct in-person learning and demand for buses and related parts remained strong as indicated by our sales backlog, significant supply chain disruptions began limiting the availability of certain critical components primarily beginning towards the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and continuing throughout fiscal 2022. Accordingly, such shortages limited the number of buses the Company could produce and deliver during this time period. 
 
 Bus sales increased 98.3 million, or 15.7 , reflecting a small increase in units booked and a 13.3 increase in average sales price per unit resulting from pricing actions taken by management to partially offset increases in inventory purchase costs as well as product and customer mix change. In fiscal 2022, 6,822 units were booked compared to 6,679 units booked for fiscal 2021. 
 
 Parts sales increased 18.3 million, or 31.2 , for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. This increase is primarily attributed to (a) more schools offering in-person learning during the 2021/2022 school year when compared with the 2020/2021 school year, which increased school bus units in operation and thus increased bus repair and maintenance activities and (b) pricing actions taken by management to offset increases in purchased parts costs. 
 
 36 

Cost of goods sold . Total cost of goods sold was 764.1 million for fiscal 2022, an increase of 152.2 million, or 24.9 , compared to 611.9 million for fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, total cost of goods sold increased from 89.5 to 95.4 . 
 
 Bus segment cost of goods sold increased 143.6 million, or 25.0 , for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily driven by increasing inventory costs as the average cost of goods sold per unit for fiscal 2022 was 22.4 higher compared to fiscal 2021. This increase was primarily due to increases in manufacturing costs attributable to a) increased raw materials costs resulting from ongoing inflationary pressures, b) supply chain disruptions that resulted in higher purchase costs for components and freight and c) increased manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from the shortage of certain critical components that required more off-line labor to produce buses. As a result, at October 1, 2022, certain Bus segment inventory had an approximate 8.8 million cumulative cost in excess of net realizable value that was recognized as a loss in fiscal 2022 with no similar activity in fiscal 2021. 
 
 The 8.6 million, or 23.2 , increase in parts segment cost of goods sold for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 largely aligned with the increase in sales volume noted above, with slight variations due to product and channel mix. 
 
 Operating (loss) profit . Operating loss was 40.7 million for fiscal 2022, a decrease of 47.2 million, or 724.0 , compared to 6.5 million of operating profit for fiscal 2021. Profitability was negatively impacted by a decrease of 35.6 million in gross profit, as outlined in the revenue and cost of goods sold discussions above, as well as an increase of 11.6 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to a 7.5 million increase in professional services, largely relating to several cost cutting and operational transformation initiatives, a 1.2 million increase in research and development expense, and a 1.1 million increase in payroll, largely resulting from merit increases for all Company employees that were effective at the beginning of fiscal 2022 and were intended to partially mitigate the impact of increasing inflation. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses during the first half of fiscal 2021 benefited from actions taken by management to reduce labor costs and certain discretionary spending during the early months of the pandemic with similar actions taken to reduce labor costs only during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 given the competitiveness of the overall labor market primarily resulting from continuing labor shortages. 
 
 Interest expense . Interest expense was 14.7 million for fiscal 2022, an increase of 5.0 million, or 51.6 , compared to 9.7 million for fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the stated term loan interest rate from 4.0 at October 2, 2021 to 7.9 at October 1, 2022, as well as increased revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding during fiscal 2022 when compared with fiscal 2021. 
 
 Income taxes . We recorded income tax benefit of 11.5 million and 1.2 million for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. This fluctuation was primarily attributable to an increase in taxable loss in fiscal 2022 due primarily to the ongoing impacts of supply chain constraints on our operations as discussed above. 
 
 The effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 differed from the statutory Federal income tax rate of 21.0 . The increase in the effective tax rate to 21.6 was primarily due to the impacts of state taxes on the Federal rate. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance. 
 
 The effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 60.2 , which differed from the statutory Federal income tax rate of 21.0 . There were several items that increased the effective tax rate, including the impacts of tax credits, return to accrual adjustments, and state taxes on the Federal rate. These increases were partially offset by a change in uncertain tax positions. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA . Adjusted EBITDA was (14.7) million, or (1.8) of net sales, for fiscal 2022, a decrease of 50.0 million, or 141.9 , compared to 35.2 million, or 5.1 of net sales, for fiscal 2021. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily the result of a 45.5 million increase in net loss, as a result of the factors discussed above, and a decrease in share-based compensation expense of 2.2 million as the expense recorded in fiscal 2021 was impacted by the retirement of two members of the executive team with no similar activity in fiscal 2022.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years presented (note that both columns in the below table have been recast to include our proportionate share of Micro Bird's interest expense, net; income tax expense or benefit; depreciation expense and amortization expense to conform with (i) similar adjustments made relating to the Company's operating results and (ii) the fiscal 2023 presentation included previously above):

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, available cash, and borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement (defined below). At September 30, 2023, the Company had 79.0 million of available cash and cash equivalents (net of outstanding checks) and 83.7 million of additional borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility (defined below). The Company s revolving line of credit is available for working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. 
 
 Credit Agreement 
 
 On December 12, 2016 (the Closing Date ), Blue Bird Body Company as the borrower ("Borrower"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, executed a 235.0 million five-year credit agreement with Bank of Montreal, which acts as the administrative agent and an issuing bank, Fifth Third Bank, as co-syndication agent and an issuing bank, and Regions Bank, as co-syndication agent, together with other lenders (the "Credit Agreement"). 
 
 The credit facilities provided for under the Credit Agreement consisted of a term loan facility in an aggregate initial principal amount of 160.0 million (the Term Loan Facility and a revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of 75.0 million. The revolving credit facility included a 15.0 million letter of credit sub-facility and 5.0 million swingline sub-facility (the Revolving Credit Facility, and together with the Term Loan Facility, each a Credit Facility and collectively, the Credit Facilities ). The borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, which were made at the Closing Date, may not be re-borrowed once they are repaid. The borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be repaid and reborrowed from time to time at our election. The proceeds of the loans under the Credit Facilities that were borrowed on the Closing Date were used to finance in part, together with available cash on hand, (i) the repayment of certain existing indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries, and (ii) transaction costs associated with the consummation of the Credit Facilities. 
 
 38 

The obligations under the Credit Agreement and the related loan documents (including without limitation, the borrowings under the Credit Facilities (including the Incremental Term Loan discussed below) and obligations in respect of certain cash management and hedging obligations owing to the agents, the lenders or their affiliates), are, in each case, secured by a lien on and security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (including the Borrower), with certain exclusions as set forth in a collateral agreement entered into on December 12, 2016. 
 
 Up to 75.0 million of additional term loans and/or revolving credit commitments may be incurred under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and which additional loans and/or commitments would require further commitments from the existing lenders or from new lenders. 
 
 The Credit Agreement contains negative and affirmative covenants affecting the Company and its subsidiaries including the Borrower, with certain exceptions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The negative covenants and restrictions include, among others: limitations on liens, dispositions of assets, consolidations and mergers, loans and investments, indebtedness, transactions with affiliates (including management fees and compensation), dividends, distributions and other restricted payments, change in fiscal year, fundamental changes, amendments to and subordinated indebtedness, restrictive agreements, sale and leaseback transactions and certain permitted acquisitions. Dividends, distributions, and other restricted payments were permitted in certain circumstances under the Credit Agreement, generally based upon our levels of excess Free Cash Flow and unrestricted cash (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and maintenance of specified TNLRs. 
 
 First Amended Credit Agreement 
 
 On September 13, 2018, the Company executed an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the "First Amended Credit Agreement"), by and among the Company, the Borrower, and Bank of Montreal, acting as administrative agent together with other lenders. The First Amended Credit Agreement provided for an aggregate lender commitment of 50.0 million in additional term loan borrowings (the Incremental Term Loan that was intended to finance a portion of a tender offer up to 50.0 million, which transaction closed in October 2018. 
 
 After giving effect to the First Amended Credit Agreement, the initial 160.0 million Term Loan Facility, with a balance of 146.2 million at September 29, 2018, increased 50.0 million, and the initial 75.0 million Revolving Credit Facility increased 25.0 million. The amended Credit Facilities each mature on September 13, 2023, the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the First Amended Credit Agreement. 
 
 After giving effect to the First Amended Credit Agreement, the interest payable with respect to the Term Loan Facility was (i) from the first amendment effective date until the first quarter ended on or about September 30, 2018, the U.S. Dollar London Interbank Offering Rate ("LIBOR") plus 2.25 and (ii) commencing with the fiscal quarter ended on or about September 30, 2018 and thereafter, dependent on the TNLR of the Company, an election of either base rate or LIBOR pursuant to the table below. The Company's TNLR is defined as the ratio of (a) consolidated net debt to (b) consolidated EBITDA, which is an adjusted EBITDA metric that could differ from Adjusted EBITDA appearing in the Company s periodic filings on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q as the adjustments to the calculations are not uniform, at the end of each fiscal quarter for the consecutive four fiscal quarter period most recently then ending. 
 Level Total Net Leverage Ratio ABR Loans Eurodollar Loans I Less than 2.00x 0.75 1.75 II Greater than or equal to 2.00x and less than 2.50x 1.00 2.00 III Greater than or equal to 2.50x and less than 3.00x 1.25 2.25 IV Greater than or equal to 3.00x and less than 3.25x 1.50 2.50 V Greater than or equal to 3.25x and less than 3.50x 1.75 2.75 VI Greater than 3.50x 2.00 3.00 
 
 Under the First Amended Credit Agreement, the principal of the Term Loan Facility must be paid in quarterly installments on the last day of each fiscal quarter, in an amount equal to: 
 2,475,000 per quarter beginning on the last day of the Company s first fiscal quarter of 2019 through the last day of the Company s third fiscal quarter in 2021; 
 3,712,500 per quarter beginning on the last day of the Company s fourth fiscal quarter in 2021 through the last day of the Company s third fiscal quarter in 2022; 
 4,950,000 per quarter beginning on the last day of the Company s fourth fiscal quarter in 2022 through the last day of the Company s second fiscal quarter in 2023, with the remaining principal amount due at maturity. 
 
 39 

There are customary events of default under the First Amended Credit Agreement, including, among other things, events of default resulting from (i) failure to pay obligations when due under the First Amended Credit Agreement, (ii) insolvency of the Company or its material subsidiaries, (iii) defaults under other material debt, (iv) judgments against the Company or its subsidiaries, (v) failure to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants (as set forth in the First Amended Credit Agreement), or (vi) a change of control of the Company, in each case subject to limitations and exceptions as set forth in the First Amended Credit Agreement. 
 
 The First Amended Credit Agreement contained customary covenants and warranties including, among other things, an amended TNLR financial maintenance covenant which required compliance as follows: 
 Period Maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio September 13, 2018 through the second quarter of the 2019 fiscal year 4.00:1.00 Second quarter of the 2019 fiscal year through the fourth quarter of the 2021 fiscal year 3.75:1.00 Fourth quarter of the 2021 fiscal year and thereafter 3.50:1.00 
 
 Second Amended Credit Agreement 
 
 On May 7, 2020, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement and First Amended Credit Agreement (the "Second Amended Credit Agreement"). The Second Amended Credit Agreement provided 41.9 million in additional revolving commitments bringing the total revolving commitments to 141.9 million. The revolving commitments under the Second Amended Credit Agreement mature on September 13, 2023, which is the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the First Amended Credit Agreement. The interest rate pricing grid remained unchanged, but the LIBOR floor was amended from 0 to 0.75 . 
 Third Amended Credit Agreement 
 
 On December 4, 2020, the Company executed a third amendment to the Credit Agreement, First Amended Credit Agreement and Second Amended Credit Agreement (the "Third Amended Credit Agreement"). The Third Amended Credit Agreement, among other things, provided for certain temporary amendments to the Credit Agreement from the third amendment effective date through and including the first date on which (a)(i) a compliance certificate was timely delivered with respect to a fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2022 demonstrating compliance with certain financial performance covenants for such fiscal quarter (the Limited Availability Period ), or (ii) the Borrower elected to terminate the Limited Availability Period; and (b) the absence of a default or event of default. 
 
 Amendments to the financial performance covenants provided that during the Limited Availability Period, a higher maximum TNLR was permitted, and required the Company to maintain liquidity (in the form of undrawn availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) of at least 15.0 million. For the duration between the fiscal quarter ended on or around December 31, 2020 and the fiscal quarter ended on or around September 30, 2021 that fell within the Limited Availability Period, a quarterly minimum consolidated EBITDA covenant applied instead of a maximum TNLR. 
 
 The pricing grid in the First Amended Credit Agreement, which was based on the ratio of the Company s consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA, remained unchanged. However, during the Limited Availability Period, an additional margin of 0.50 applied. 
 
 During the Limited Availability Period, the Third Amended Credit Agreement required that the Borrower prepay existing revolving loans and, if undrawn and unreimbursed letters of credit exceeded 7.0 million, cash collateralize letters of credit if unrestricted cash and cash equivalents exceed 20.0 million, as determined on a semimonthly basis. Any issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension of credit during the Limited Availability Period could not cause unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to exceed 20.0 million, or cause the aggregate outstanding Revolving Credit Facility principal to exceed 100.0 million. The Third Amended Credit Agreement also implemented a cap on permissible investments, restricted payments, certain payments of indebtedness and the fair market value of all assets subject to permitted dispositions during the Limited Availability Period. 
 
 For the duration of the Limited Availability Period, the Third Amended Credit Agreement set forth additional monthly reporting requirements, and required subordination agreements and intercreditor arrangements for certain other indebtedness and liens subject to administrative agent approval. 
 
 Fourth Amended Credit Agreement 
 
 On November 24, 2021, the Company executed a fourth amendment to the Credit Agreement, First Amended Credit Agreement, Second Amended Credit Agreement and Third Amended Credit Agreement (the "Fourth Amended Credit Agreement"). The Fourth 
 40 

Amended Credit Agreement, among other things, provided for certain temporary amendments to the Credit Agreement from the third amendment effective date through and including (a) April 1, 2023 (the Amended Limited Availability Period ), or (b) the first date on which Borrower elected to terminate the Amended Limited Availability Period, in each case, subject to (x) the absence of a default or event of default and (y) pro forma compliance with the financial covenant performance covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement. 
 
 With respect to the financial performance covenants, during the Amended Limited Availability Period for the fiscal quarters ending January 1, 2022 through October 1, 2022, the TNLR requirement was not applicable, although it continued to impact the interest rate that was charged on outstanding borrowings as discussed below. Instead, the minimum consolidated EBITDA that the Company was required to maintain during the Amended Limited Availability Period was updated to include fiscal 2022 as set forth in the table below (in millions): 
 
 Period Minimum Consolidated EBITDA Fiscal quarter ending January 1, 2022 14.5 Fiscal quarter ending April 2, 2022 (4.5) Fiscal quarter ending July 2, 2022 (6.8) Fiscal quarter ending October 1, 2022 20.0 
 
 However, in the event that Borrower elected to terminate the Amended Limited Availability Period in fiscal 2022, the maximum TNLR permitted was 3.50x. 
 
 The minimum liquidity (in the form of undrawn availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) that the Company was required to maintain during the Amended Limited Availability Period was amended as set forth in the table below (in millions): 
 
 Period Minimum Liquidity Fourth amendment effective date through January 1, 2022 10.0 January 2, 2022 through April 2, 2022 5.0 April 3, 2022 through July 2, 2022 15.0 Thereafter 20.0 
 
 Additionally, a new financial performance covenant was added in the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement, requiring that school bus units manufactured by the Company Units not fall below the pre-set thresholds set forth in the table below on a three month trailing basis Units Covenant ). The Units Covenant was triggered only if the Company s liquidity for the most-recently ended fiscal month was less than 50.0 million during the Amended Limited Availability Period: 
 
 Period Minimum Units Manufactured Three month period ending November 27, 2021 1,128 Three month period ending January 1, 2022 776 Three month period ending January 29, 2022 748 Three month period ending February 26, 2022 727 Three month period ending April 2, 2022 763 Three month period ending April 30, 2022 1,111 Three month period ending May 28, 2022 1,525 Three month period ending July 2, 2022 2,053 Three month period ending July30, 2022 2,072 Three month period ending August 27, 2022 2,199 Three month period ending October 1, 2022 2,306 
 
 If the Units during any three fiscal month period set forth above was less than the minimum required by the Units Covenant, Borrower could elect to carry forward up to 50 of certain applicable excess Units to satisfy the Units Covenant requirement. However, Borrower could not make such election in two consecutive three fiscal month periods. 
 
 41 

The pricing grid in the Amended Credit Agreement, which was based on the TNLR, was determined in accordance with the amended pricing matrix set forth below: 
 
 Level Total Net Leverage Ratio ABR Loans Eurodollar Loans I Less than 2.00x 0.75 1.75 II Greater than or equal to 2.00x and less than 2.50x 1.00 2.00 III Greater than or equal to 2.50x and less than 3.00x 1.25 2.25 IV Greater than or equal to 3.00x and less than 3.25x 1.50 2.50 V Greater than or equal to 3.25x and less than 3.50x 1.75 2.75 VI Greater than or equal to 3.50x and less than 4.50x 2.00 3.00 VII Greater than or equal to 4.50x and less than 5.00x 3.25 4.25 VIII Greater than 5.00x 4.25 5.25 
 
 During the Amended Limited Availability Period (notwithstanding the pricing grid set forth above), the applicable rate was (a) solely to the extent that the aggregate revolving exposures exceeded 100.0 million, 5.75 with respect to such excess and (b) with respect to all other revolving exposures, the sum of the rate determined by the administrative agent in accordance with the pricing grid set forth above, plus 0.50 . 
 
 Additional allowances were made in the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement for the Company to issue or incur up to 100.0 million of qualified equity interests issued by the Company, unsecured subordinated indebtedness or unsecured convertible indebtedness (collectively, Junior Capital ). Upon the issuance or incurrence of any Junior Capital, the Company was required to prepay the outstanding revolving loans (with no permanent reduction in the revolving commitments) in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) 100 of the net proceeds from such Junior Capital and (b) the aggregate of revolving exposures then outstanding. Prior to the initial issuance or incurrence of any Junior Capital, any issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension of credit during the Amended Limited Availability Period could not cause the aggregate outstanding Revolving Credit Facility principal to exceed 110.0 million Availability Cap ). Following the issuance and sale of 75.0 million of common stock in a private placement transaction on December 15, 2021 (see the section entitled "Short-Term and Long-Term Liquidity Requirements" below for further details), the Availability Cap was permanently reduced to 100.0 million. 
 
 For the duration of the Amended Limited Availability Period, the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement set forth additional monthly reporting requirements in connection with the manufactured school bus units required by the financial performance covenants, when applicable. 
 
 Fifth Amended Credit Agreement 
 
 On September 2, 2022, the Company executed a fifth amendment and limited waiver to the Credit Agreement, First Amended Credit Agreement, Second Amended Credit Agreement, Third Amended Credit Agreement and Fourth Amended Credit Agreement ("Fifth Amended Credit Agreement"). The Fifth Amended Credit Agreement, among other things, resulted in Borrower and administrative agent jointly electing an early opt-in to change one of the market interest rate indices that Borrower can elect to accrue interest on outstanding borrowings from LIBOR, which was discontinued subsequent to June 30, 2023, to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York SOFR ). Such change became effective at the end of the applicable interest period for any LIBOR borrowings outstanding on the fifth amendment effective date. 
 
 The Fifth Amended Credit Agreement also provided covenant relief, through December 31, 2022, via a waiver of the 20.0 million minimum consolidated EBITDA covenant calculated on a four quarter trailing basis for the fiscal quarter ended October 1, 2022 and the 2,306 minimum Units Covenant calculated on a three fiscal month trailing basis for the fiscal month ended October 1, 2022. The Company requested such covenant relief given the supply chain disruptions that continued to challenge the Company throughout fiscal 2022. 
 
 Finally, the Fifth Amended Credit Agreement requires the Company to provide a rolling thirteen week cash flow forecast to the administrative agent, on a monthly basis, beginning with the fiscal month ended August 27, 2022 and ending with the fiscal month ending April 1, 2023. 
 
 Sixth Amended Credit Agreement 
 
 On November 21, 2022, the Company executed a sixth amendment to the Credit Agreement, First Amended Credit Agreement, Second Amended Credit Agreement, Third Amended Credit Agreement, Fourth Amended Credit Agreement and Fifth Amended Credit Agreement ("Sixth Amended Credit Agreement" and collectively, the "Amended Credit Agreement"). The Sixth Amended Credit Agreement, among other things, extends the maturity date for both the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility from September 13, 2023 to December 31, 2024. The total Revolving Credit Facility commitment is reduced to an aggregate principal 
 42 

amount of 90.0 million, of which 80.0 million is available for Borrower to draw, with the remaining 10.0 million subject to written approval from the lenders, which, once obtained, will be irrevocable. There was no change in the Term Loan Facility commitment; however, the Sixth Amended Credit Agreement requires principal repayments approximating 5.0 million on a quarterly basis through September 30, 2024, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. There were 151.6 million of term loan borrowings outstanding on the sixth amendment effective date. 
 
 The Sixth Amended Credit Agreement also provides for temporary amendments to certain financial performance covenants during the Amended Limited Availability Period, which will terminate on the date on which the Company s TNLR for the two fiscal quarters most recently ended is each less than 4.00x and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. However, the Amended Limited Available Period can re-occur upon a default or event of default or if the TNLR for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is equal to or greater than 4.00x. 
 
 The minimum consolidated EBITDA that the Company is required to maintain during the Amended Limited Availability Period is updated as set forth in the table below (in millions): 
 
 Period Minimum Consolidated EBITDA Fiscal quarter ending July 1, 2023 50.0 Fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2023 60.0 
 
 For purposes of complying with the above minimum consolidated EBITDA covenant, the Company s consolidated EBITDA for the (i) two fiscal quarter period ending July 1, 2023 is multiplied by 2 and (ii) three fiscal quarter period ending September 30, 2023 is multiplied by 4/3 
 
 The minimum liquidity (in the form of undrawn availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) that the Company is required to maintain at the end of each fiscal month during the Amended Limited Availability Period is amended as set forth in the table below (in millions): 
 
 Period Minimum Liquidity Sixth amendment effective date through December 30, 2023 30.0 
 
 Additionally, the Units Covenant is amended for Units to be calculated at the end of each applicable fiscal month on a cumulative basis, with the minimum cumulative threshold that the Company is required to maintain during the Amended Limited Availability Period amended as set forth in the table below. The Units Covenant is triggered only if the Company s liquidity for the most-recently ended fiscal month is less than 50.0 million during the Amended Limited Availability Period: 
 
 Period Minimum Units Manufactured Period from October 2, 2022 and ending October 29, 2022 450 Period from October 2, 2022 and ending November 26, 2022 900 Period from October 2, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022 1,400 Period from October 2, 2022 and ending January 28, 2023 1,900 Period from October 2, 2022 and ending February 25, 2023 2,400 Period from October 2, 2022 and ending April 1, 2023 3,000 
 
 The Company is not required to comply with a maximum TNLR financial maintenance covenant for any fiscal quarters from the sixth amendment effective date through September 30, 2023, with the maximum threshold amended thereafter as follows : 
 Period Maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio Fiscal Quarter ending December 30, 2023 through the fiscal quarter ending March 30, 2024 4.00:1.00 Fiscal quarter ending June 29, 2024 and thereafter 3.50:1.00 
 
 The pricing grid in the Amended Credit Agreement, which is based on the TNLR, is applicable to both term loan and revolving borrowings and is determined in accordance with the amended pricing matrix set forth below: 
 
 43 

Level Total Net Leverage Ratio ABR Loans SOFR Loans I Less than 2.00x 0.75 1.75 II Greater than or equal to 2.00x and less than 2.50x 1.00 2.00 III Greater than or equal to 2.50x and less than 3.00x 1.25 2.25 IV Greater than or equal to 3.00x and less than 3.25x 1.50 2.50 V Greater than or equal to 3.25x and less than 3.50x 1.75 2.75 VI Greater than or equal to 3.50x and less than 4.00x 2.00 3.00 VII Greater than or equal to 4.00x and less than 4.50x 2.75 3.75 VIII Greater than or equal to 4.50x and less than 5.00x 3.75 4.75 IX Greater than 5.00x 4.75 5.75 
 
 Further, the pricing margins for levels VII though IX above are each increased (x) by 0.25 if the aggregate revolving borrowings are equal to or greater than 50.0 million and less than or equal to 80.0 million and (y) by 0.50 if the aggregate revolving borrowings are greater than 80.0 million. On the sixth amendment effective date, the interest rate was set at SOFR plus 5.75 and was adjusted, as applicable, in future fiscal quarters in accordance with the amended pricing grid set forth above. 
 
 Finally, the Company is required to deliver to the administrative agent, on a quarterly basis, a projected consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of projected operations and cash flows for the next four fiscal quarter period. 
 
 At September 30, 2023, the Borrower and the guarantors under the Amended Credit Agreement were in compliance with all covenants. 
 
 2023 Credit Agreement 
 
 On November 17, 2023 (the 2023 Closing Date ), Borrower executed a 250.0 million five-year credit agreement with Bank of Montreal, acting as administrative agent and an issuing bank; several joint lead arranger partners and issuing banks, including Bank of America; and a syndicate of other lenders (the "2023 Credit Agreement"). 
 
 The credit facilities provided for under the 2023 Credit Agreement consist of a term loan facility in an aggregate initial principal amount of 100.0 million (the 2023 Term Loan Facility and a revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of 150.0 million. The revolving credit facility includes a 25.0 million letter of credit sub-facility and 5.0 million swingline sub-facility (the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility, and together with the 2023 Term Loan Facility, each a 2023 Credit Facility and collectively, the 2023 Credit Facilities ). 
 
 A minimum of 100.0 million of additional term loans and/or revolving credit commitments may be incurred under the 2023 Credit Agreement, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the 2023 Credit Agreement, and which additional loans and/or commitments would require further commitments from existing lenders or from new lenders. 
 
 Borrower has the right to prepay the loans outstanding under the 2023 Credit Facilities without premium or penalty (subject to customary breakage costs, if applicable). Additionally, proceeds from asset sales, condemnation, casualty insurance and/or debt issuances (in certain circumstances) are required to be used to prepay borrowings outstanding under the 2023 Credit Facilities. Borrowings under the 2023 Term Loan Facility, which were made at the 2023 Closing Date, may not be re-borrowed once they are repaid while borrowings under the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility may be repaid and reborrowed from time to time at our election. 
 
 The 2023 Term Loan Facility is subject to amortization of principal, payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each fiscal quarter, commencing on March 30, 2024, with 5.0 of the 100.0 million aggregate principal amount of all initial term loans outstanding at the 2023 Closing Date payable each year prior to the maturity date of the 2023 Term Loan Facility. The remaining initial aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2023 Term Loan Facility, as well as any outstanding borrowings under the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility, will be payable on the November 17, 2028 maturity date of the 2023 Credit Agreement. 
 
 The 2023 Credit Facilities are guaranteed by all of the Company s wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (subject to customary exceptions) and are secured by a security agreement which pledges a lien on virtually all of the assets of Borrower, the Company and the Company s other wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, other than any owned or leased real property and subject to customary exceptions. 
 
 The 100.0 million of 2023 Term Loan Facility proceeds and 36.2 million of 2023 Revolving Credit Facility proceeds that were borrowed on the 2023 Closing Date were used to pay (i) the 131.8 million of Term Loan Facility indebtedness outstanding under the 
 44 

Amended Credit Agreement (ii) interest and commitment fees accrued under the Amended Credit Agreement through the 2023 Closing Date and (iii) transaction costs associated with the consummation of the 2023 Credit Agreement. 
 
 Under the terms of the 2023 Credit Agreement, Borrower, the Company and the Company s other wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable, and lender remedies). 
 
 Borrowings under the 2023 Credit Facilities bear interest, at our option, at (i) base rate or (ii) SOFR plus 0.10 , plus an applicable margin depending on the TNLR of the Company as follows: 
 
 Level Total Net Leverage Ratio ABR Loans SOFR Loans 
 I Less than 1.00x 
 0.75 1.75 II Greater than or equal to 1.00x and less than 1.50x 
 1.50 2.50 III Greater than or equal to 1.50x and less than 2.25x 
 2.00 3.00 IV Greater than or equal to 2.25x 
 2.25 3.25 
 
 Pricing on the Closing Date was set at Level III until receipt of the financial information and related compliance certificate for the first fiscal quarter ending after the 2023 Closing Date. 
 
 Borrower is also required to pay lenders an unused commitment fee of between 0.25 and 0.45 per annum on the undrawn commitments under the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility, depending on the TNLR, quarterly in arrears. 
 
 The 2023 Credit Agreement also includes a requirement that the Company comply with the following financial covenants on the last day of each fiscal quarter through maturity: (i) a pro forma TNLR of not greater than 3.00:1.00 and (ii) a pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the 2023 Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.20:1.00. 
 
 Short-Term and Long-Term Liquidity Requirements 
 
 Our ability to make principal and interest payments on borrowings under our credit facility and our ability to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other conditions. The adverse impacts from ongoing supply chain disruptions, which were further exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, materially impacted our operations and results during the second half of fiscal 2021 and all of fiscal 2022 due to higher purchasing costs, including freight costs incurred to expedite receipt of critical components, increased manufacturing inefficiencies and our inability to complete the production of buses to fulfill sales orders. Towards the end of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, there were slight improvements in the supply chain's ability to deliver the parts and components necessary to support our production operations, resulting in increased (i) manufacturing efficiencies and (ii) production of buses to fulfill sales orders during fiscal 2023. However, the higher costs charged by suppliers to procure inventory that continued into fiscal 2023 had a significant adverse impact on our operations and results. Specifically, such cost increases outpaced the increases in sales prices that we charged for the buses that were sold during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, many of which were included in the backlog of fixed price sales orders originating in fiscal 2021 and the early months of fiscal 2022 that carried forward into fiscal 2023. During the remainder of fiscal 2023, the buses that were sold were generally included in the backlog of fixed price sales orders originating more recently (i.e., the latter months of fiscal 2022 and in fiscal 2023), with the cumulative increases in sales prices we charged for those buses generally outpacing the higher costs we paid to procure inventory, resulting in gross profit during the quarters. While the gross margin on bus sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 lagged the historical gross margin reported prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it returned to more normal historical levels during the latter half of fiscal 2023. The development and fluidity of ongoing or future supply chain constraints preclude any prediction as to the ultimate severity of the adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Also see "Impacts of COVID-19 and Subsequent Supply Chain Constraints on our Business" and "Impact of Russia's Invasion of Ukraine on Our Business" contained in this Item 7. for further discussion. 
 
 Future COVID-19 outbreaks and/or continuing supply chain constraints could cause a more severe contraction in our profits and/or liquidity which could lead to issues complying with our 2023 Credit Agreement covenants. Beginning in fiscal 2024 and thereafter, our primary financial covenants are a (i) pro forma TNLR, defined as the ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA (which is an adjusted EBITDA metric that could differ from Adjusted EBITDA appearing in the Company s periodic filings on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q as the adjustments to the calculations are not uniform) on a trailing four quarter basis, of not greater than 3.00:1.00 and (ii) pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the 2023 Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.20:1.00. If we are not able to comply with such covenants, we may need to seek covenant relief or even refinance the debt to a "covenant light" or "no covenant" structure. We can offer no assurance that we would be successful in amending or refinancing our debt. An amendment or refinancing of our debt could lead to higher interest rates and possible up-front expenses than included in our historical financial statements. 
 45 

Under the revised terms of the Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, 19.8 million in principal payments were required to be repaid in fiscal 2024 with the remaining 112.0 million due in fiscal 2025. However, with the successful refinancing of our debt in November 2023 via the execution of the 2023 Credit Agreement, 3.8 million in principal payments are due in fiscal 2024, with 5.0 million in principal payments due in each of fiscal 2025 through 2028 and the remaining 76.2 million due upon maturity in fiscal 2029. 
 
 We have operating and finance leases for office space, warehouse space, or a combination of both. Our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 0.3 years to 5.9 years with the option to extend leases for up to 0.3 years. Finance leases run through fiscal 2025 and have total payments of approximately 1.6 million, approximately 0.6 million of which is due in fiscal 2024. Operating leases have remaining terms up to 5.9 years and total payments of approximately 5.9 million, approximately 1.9 million of which is due in fiscal 2024. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into short-term contractual purchase orders for manufacturing inventory and capital assets. At September 30, 2023, total purchase commitments were 109.2 million, of which all is expected to be paid in fiscal 2024. 
 
 On December 15, 2021, we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate 4,687,500 shares of our common stock at 16.00 per share. The approximate 74.8 million of net proceeds that we received from this transaction were used to repay outstanding revolving borrowings as required by the terms of the Credit Agreement, which increased the available borrowing capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility that could be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, investments in technologies or businesses, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Refer to Note 13, Stockholders' (Deficit) Equity , to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this transaction. 
 
 To increase our liquidity in future periods, we could pursue raising additional capital via an equity or debt offering utilizing a currently effective "shelf" registration statement. However, we can offer no assurance that we would be successful in raising this additional capital, which could also lead to increased expense and larger up-front fees when compared with our historical financial statements. 
 Seasonality 
 
 Historically, our business has been highly seasonal with school districts buying their new school buses so that they would be available for use on the first day of the school year, typically in mid-August to early September. This has resulted in our third and fourth fiscal quarters representing our two busiest quarters from a sales and production perspective, the latter ending on the Saturday closest to September 30. Our quarterly results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity have historically been, and are likely to be in future periods, impacted by seasonal patterns. Working capital has historically been a significant use of cash during the first fiscal quarter due to planned shutdowns and a significant source of cash generation in the fourth fiscal quarter. With the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply chain constraints, seasonality and working capital trends have become unpredictable. Seasonality and variations from historical seasonality have impacted the comparison of working capital and liquidity results between fiscal periods. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table sets forth general information derived from our statement of cash flows for the fiscal years presented: 
 (in thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year 
 10,479 11,709 44,507 Total cash provided by (used in) operating activities 
 119,928 (24,437) (54,241) Total cash used in investing activities 
 (8,520) (6,453) (11,309) Total cash (used in) provided by financing activities 
 (42,899) 29,660 32,752 Change in cash and cash equivalents 
 68,509 (1,230) (32,798) Cash and cash equivalents, end of year 
 78,988 10,479 11,709 
 
 Total cash provided by (used in) operating activities 
 
 Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities totaled 119.9 million for fiscal 2023 and (24.4) million for fiscal 2022. The primary drivers of the 144.4 million increase were the following: 
 
 A year over year increase of 69.6 million in net income. 
 46 

The effect of net changes in operating assets and liabilities positively impacted fiscal 2023 operating cash flows by 79.0 million compared to fiscal 2022. The primary drivers in this category were favorable changes in accounts receivable, inventory, and accrued expenses, pension and other liabilities of 2.5 million, 34.2 million, and 50.1 million respectively. These favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts payable and other assets of 6.4 million and 1.5 million, respectively. At the end of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, we became more efficient at managing supply chain disruptions, and thus building and selling buses. These efficiencies resulted in us consuming more inventory in production, which resulted in a decrease in the inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2023 (a net source of cash) when compared with an increase in the inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2022 (a net use of cash). The accounts payable balance is significantly influenced by the purchase of inventory that is required to produce buses during the last few weeks of each fiscal year. However, the supply chain disruptions that we experienced during fiscal 2022 resulted in us purchasing inventory (and therefore, increasing accounts payable) that was not consumed in the production process as we were missing certain critical components that prevented us from building and selling buses. Accordingly, the increase in the accounts payable balance (a net source of cash) was higher in fiscal 2022 than in fiscal 2023, which had an unfavorable impact on cash flows. Finally, in fiscal 2023 we began receiving deposits for school buses ordered under the terms the Clean School Bus Rebate Program, which provided a net source of cash year over year as there was no similar activity in fiscal 2022. 
 
 The impact of non-cash items (net source of cash) was 4.2 million lower in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Non-cash items impact net income or loss but do not have direct cash flows associated with them. The significant differences relate to the impact of an 8.8 million lower of cost or net realizable value loss and 1.4 million fixed assets impairment, both present in fiscal 2022, with no similar losses in fiscal 2023, as well as an 11.1 million increase in equity in net income of non-consolidated affiliate, a 2.6 million decrease in amortization of deferred actuarial pension losses and a 1.9 million decrease in non-cash interest expense, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. These decreases were partially offset by a 19.1 million increase in deferred income tax expense and a 1.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. 
 
 Cash flows used in operating activities totaled 24.4 million for fiscal 2022 and 54.2 million for fiscal 2021. The primary drivers of the 29.8 million decrease were the following: 
 
 A year over year increase of 45.5 million in net loss. 
 
 The effect of net changes in operating assets and liabilities positively impacted fiscal 2022 operating cash flows by 69.0 million compared to fiscal 2021. The primary drivers in this category were favorable changes in inventory, other assets, accounts payables, and accrued expenses of 42.2 million, 2.3 million, 21.0 million, and 3.8 million respectively. These favorable changes were partially offset by an unfavorable change in accounts receivable of 0.2 million. At the end of fiscal 2022, inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions significantly increased our purchase costs for components and freight, which resulted in a significant increase in the accounts payable balance when compared with the end fiscal 2021 (a net source of cash). However, we became more efficient at managing supply chain disruptions, and thus building and selling buses, during the latter months of fiscal 2022 when compared with the same months in fiscal 2021. These efficiencies resulted in us consuming more inventory in production, which resulted in a significant, but smaller, increase in the inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2022 when compared with fiscal 2021 (a net source of cash). 
 
 The impact of non-cash items (net source of cash) was 6.3 million higher in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Non-cash items impact net income or loss but do not have direct cash flows associated with them. The significant differences relate to the impact of an 8.8 million increase in lower of cost or net realizable value loss, 4.7 million increase in equity in net loss of non-consolidated affiliate, 1.9 million increase in amortization of deferred actuarial pension losses, 1.4 million increase in fixed assets impairment, 0.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, 0.6 million increase in non-cash interest expense, and 0.7 million decrease in gain on disposal of fixed assets, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. These increases were partially offset by a 2.2 million decrease in share-based compensation expense and a 10.1 million increase in deferred tax benefit, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. 
 
 Total cash used in investing activities 
 
 Cash flows used in investing activities totaled 8.5 million and 6.5 million for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. The 2.1 million increase in cash used was primarily due to increased spending on fixed assets in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, as increased profitability in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 allowed for more capital spending. During fiscal 2022, capital spending was reduced to lower than normal amounts in an effort to mitigate the impact of supply chain constraints on our operations, financial results and cash flows. 
 
 47 

Cash flows used in investing activities totaled 6.5 million and 11.3 million for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. The 4.9 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to decreased spending on fixed assets in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. 
 
 Total cash (used in) provided by financing activities 
 
 Cash (used in) provided by financing activities totaled (42.9) million for fiscal 2023 and 29.7 million for fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2022, the private placement sale of our common stock provided 74.8 million of net cash proceeds, with no similar activity in fiscal 2023. Also contributing to the increase in cash used was a 5.0 million increase in term loan repayments in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. These were partially offset by a 5.0 million decrease in net revolving credit facility repayments, and a 1.3 million decrease in cash paid for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in connection with employee stock award exercises, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities totaled 29.7 million for fiscal 2022 and 32.8 million for fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, the private placement sale of our common stock provided 74.8 million of net cash proceeds, with no similar activity in fiscal 2021. This source of cash was offset by a 70.0 million decrease in net revolving credit facility borrowings, a 5.0 million increase in term loan repayments, a 1.2 million increase in cash paid for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in connection with employee stock award exercises, a 1.6 million decrease in cash received for employee stock option exercises, and a 0.3 million increase in cash paid for debt costs, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. 
 
 Free cash flow 
 
 Management believes the non-GAAP measurement of Free Cash Flow, defined as net cash used in or provided by operating activities less cash paid for fixed assets and acquired intangible assets, fairly represents the Company s ability to generate surplus cash that could fund activities not in the ordinary course of business. See Key Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Performance for further discussion. The following table sets forth the calculation of Free Cash Flow for the fiscal years presented: 
 (in thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Total cash provided by (used in) operating activities 
 119,928 (24,437) (54,241) Cash paid for fixed assets and acquired intangible assets 
 (8,520) (6,453) (12,212) Free Cash Flow 
 111,408 (30,890) (66,453) 
 
 Free Cash Flow for fiscal 2023 was 142.3 million higher than for fiscal 2022, due to a 144.4 million increase in cash provided by (used in) operating activities, which was partially offset by a 2.1 million increase in cash paid for fixed assets, both as discussed above. 
 
 Free Cash Flow for fiscal 2022 was 35.6 million higher than for fiscal 2021 due to a 29.8 million decrease in cash used in operating activities as discussed above and a reduction of 5.8 million in cash paid for fixed assets in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 as we limited capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 to further mitigate the ongoing impact of supply chain constraints on our operations, financial results and cash flows. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet arrangements 
 
 We had outstanding letters of credit totaling 6.3 million at September 30, 2023, the majority of which secure our self-insured workers compensation program, the collateral for which is regulated by the State of Georgia. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 T he preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. At the date of the financial statements, these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, and during the reporting period, these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. For example, significant management judgments are required in determining excess, obsolete, or unsalable inventory; allowance for doubtful accounts; potential impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets; and the accounting for self-insurance reserves, warranty reserves, pension obligations, income taxes, environmental liabilities and contingencies. Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty, and, accordingly, the Company s accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company s operating environment changes. The Company evaluates and updates its assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and may 
 48 

employ outside experts to assist in the Company s evaluations. Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Actual results could differ from the estimates that the Company has used. 
 
 The estimates that require management to exercise the greatest extent of judgment in establishing assumptions and that could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements should they change significantly in a future period are defined as "critical" in nature and include the following: 
 
 Self-Insurance Reserves 
 
 The Company is self-insured for the majority of its workers compensation and medical claims. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date is not discounted and is recognized as a liability. Self-insurance losses for claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using loss development factors and actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical loss development experience. The establishment of the reserves utilizing such estimates and assumptions is based on the premise that historical claims experience is indicative of current or future expected activity, which could differ significantly. At September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, reserves totaled approximately 6.2 million and 5.8 million, respectively. 
 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the fair value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed in connection with such acquisition. In accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other ASC 350 ), goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives acquired in an acquisition are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently should an event occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may be a significant change in business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition, changes in strategy or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof. Although management believes the assumptions used in the determination of the value of the enterprise are reasonable, no assurance can be given that these assumptions will be achieved. As a result, impairment charges may occur when goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment in the future. 
 
 We have two reporting units for which we test goodwill for impairment: Bus and Parts. In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary or to perform a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Under the qualitative assessment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If under the quantitative assessment the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the amount of the impairment loss, if any, must be measured under step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. 
 
 Fair value of the reporting units is estimated primarily using the income approach, which incorporates the use of discounted cash flow ("DCF") analysis. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market shares, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate and working capital changes. The cash flow forecasts are based on approved strategic operating plans. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year presented, we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill that did not indicate that an impairment existed. 
 
 In the evaluation of indefinite lived assets for impairment, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary, or to perform a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair value of an asset to its carrying amount. The Company s intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is the Blue Bird trade-name. Under the qualitative assessment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of the asset unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If a qualitative assessment is not performed or if a quantitative assessment is otherwise required, then the entity compares the fair value of an asset to its carrying amount and the amount of the impairment loss, if any, is the difference between fair value and carrying value. The fair value of our trade name is derived by using the relief from royalty method, which discounts the estimated cash savings we realize by owning the name instead of otherwise having to license or lease it. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year presented, we performed our annual impairment assessment of our trade name that did not indicate that an impairment existed. 
 49 

Our intangible assets with definite useful lives include customer relationships and engineering designs, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 7 or 20 years using the straight-line method. These assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. No impairments have been recorded. 
 
 The recorded balances for goodwill were 15.1 million and 3.7 million for the Bus and Parts segments, respectively, at both September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022. The recorded balances for intangible assets were 45.4 million and 47.4 million at September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively. 
 
 Pensions 
 
 We have pension benefit costs and obligations, which are developed from actuarial valuations. Actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability relating to our plan. These factors include assumptions we make about interest rates and expected investment return on plan assets. In addition, our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as mortality rates to develop our valuations. We review and update these assumptions on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year. We are required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. Effective January 1, 2006, the benefit plan was frozen to all participants. No accrual of future benefits is earned or calculated beyond this date. Accordingly, our obligation estimate is based on benefits earned at that time discounted using an estimate of the single equivalent discount rate determined by matching the plan s future expected cash flows to spot rates from a yield curve comprised of high-quality corporate bond rates of various durations. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the pension benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, appropriate consideration is given to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the fund and rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment and we consider asset allocations, input from an external pension investment adviser, and risks and other factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy. The focus is on long-term trends and provides for the consideration of recent plan performance. 
 
 The actuarial assumptions that we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions as well as longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the measurement of our pension benefit obligations, and to the amount of pension benefits expense we may record. For example, at September 30, 2023, a one-half percent increase in the discount rate would reduce the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans by approximately 4.6 million, while a one-half percent decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans by approximately 5.0 million. 
 
 The projected benefit obligation for the pension plan was 108.4 million and 122.6 million at September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively. 
 
 Product Warranty Costs 
 
 The Company s products are generally warranted against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one to five years. A provision for estimated warranty costs is recorded at the time a unit is sold. The methodology to determine the warranty reserve calculates the average expected future warranty claims using historical warranty claims by body type, by month, over the life of the bus, which is then multiplied by remaining months under warranty, by warranty type. The establishment of the reserve utilizing such estimates and assumptions is based on the premise that historical claims experience, both in terms of the volume of claims activity and related cost, is indicative of future expected claims activity. Management believes the methodology is reasonable (i) since the Company's product offerings and manufacturing processes do not change quickly or significantly and (ii) given the significant investments that the Company has made, and expects to continue making, to improve the quality, reliability and safety of the school buses it manufactures. Accordingly, while management believes that this methodology provides an accurate reserve estimate, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring future adjustments. For example, at September 30, 2023, a 5 increase or decrease in the average lifetime historical warranty claims by body type, by month would increase or decrease accrued product warranty costs by approximately 0.8 million. 
 
 At September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, accrued product warranty costs totaled approximately 15.4 million and 16.0 million, respectively. 
 
 50 

Income Taxes 
 
 The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ), which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates its ability, based on the weight of evidence available, to realize future tax benefits from deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance to reduce a deferred tax asset to a level which, more likely than not, will be realized in future years. At September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, deferred tax liabilities totaled approximately 22.9 million and 22.0 million, respectively, while deferred tax assets totaled approximately 22.6 million and 32.9 million, respectively. 
 
 The Company recognizes uncertain tax positions based on a cumulative probability assessment if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by an appropriate tax authority with full knowledge of all information. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized. Amounts recorded for uncertain tax positions are periodically assessed, including the evaluation of new facts and circumstances, to ensure sustainability of the positions. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. There was no liability for uncertain tax positions at September 30, 2023 and 0.1 million at October 1, 2022. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 A discussion of recently issued accounting standards applicable to the Company is described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Report, and we incorporate such discussion by reference herein. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are charged variable rates of interest on our indebtedness outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement, which exposes us to fluctuations in interest rates. We monitor and manage interest rate exposure as part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of interest rates and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our business. However, changes in interest rates cannot always be predicted, hedged, or offset with price increases to eliminate earnings volatility. Based upon the balance of term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2023, a one percent change in market interest rates would increase or decrease, as applicable, annual interest expense, and ultimately cash flows from operations, by approximately 1.3 million. 
 
 Commodity Risk 
 
 The Company and its suppliers incorporate raw and finished commodities such as steel, copper, aluminum, and other automotive type commodities into its products. We often bid on contracts weeks or months before school buses are delivered and enter into school bus sales contracts with fixed prices per bus. The sales bids historically have not included price escalation provisions to account for economic fluctuations between the bid date and the contract date. As a result, we have historically been unable to pass along increased costs due to economic fluctuations to our customers, which is not expected to continue as the Company now includes price escalation provisions when bidding on contracts. However, once a sales contract containing a fixed bus price is executed with a customer, we are generally unable to pass along increased costs resulting from economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date. We generally purchase steel up to four quarters in advance at fixed prices, but because we generally do not otherwise hedge steel or the other primary commodities we purchase (rubber, aluminum and copper), changes in prices of raw materials can significantly impact future operating margins. 
 
 Currency Risk 
 
 The Company transacts substantially all of its sales in U.S. Dollars. Our foreign customers have exposure to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our sales in that region, due in part to the time that elapses between a fixed price order date and delivery/payment for the order. Foreign currency exchange rates can have material adverse effects on our foreign customers' ability to purchase our products. Therefore, at times, we may allow them to pay in their local currency and we may utilize derivative instruments to hedge changes in foreign currency exchange rates for those transactions.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Blue Bird Corporation 
 Macon, Georgia 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Blue Bird Corporation (the Company and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and schedule (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and our report dated December 11, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Evaluation of Warranty Reserve 
 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's warranty reserve is calculated based on the average expected warranty claims using warranty claims by body type, by month, over the life of the bus, which is then multiplied by remaining months under warranty, by warranty type. The total warranty reserve was 15.4 million as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 We identified the evaluation of the methodology, including the assumptions for the average warranty costs per unit and the payment patterns over the term of the warranty used in the evaluation of the warranty reserve as a critical audit matter. 
 
 The principle considerations for our determination were (i) the Company s methodology and assumptions relating to the average warranty costs per unit and the payment patterns over the term of the warranty involved a higher degree of auditor judgment, and (ii) specialized actuarial skills were needed to assess the Company's process and evaluate the methodology and assumptions regarding the determination of the average expected warranty claims and the effect of those assumptions on the reserve. 
 52 

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
 
 Testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's warranty claim process, and controls over the data, inputs, and methodology and assumptions utilized to estimate the warranty reserve; 
 
 Testing management's process used to develop the warranty reserve, including the mathematical accuracy of the calculation and the relevance, reliability, and appropriateness of the methodology and assumptions and the sources of data from which the assumptions were derived; 
 
 Utilizing actuarial professionals with specialized knowledge and skills to assist in: (i) reviewing the Company s actuarial methodology in calculating the warranty reserve, (ii) evaluating certain key assumptions related to the average warranty costs per unit and payment patterns over the term of the warranty, in the determination of the average expected warranty claims, and (iii) determining whether the methodology, assumptions, and calculation were consistent with historical evaluations and the aggregate impact of any changes to assumptions.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Impacts of COVID-19 and Subsequent Supply Chain Constraints on our Business 
 
 Towards the end of the second quarter of our fiscal year that ended October 3, 2020 fiscal 2020 ), the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 spread throughout the world, resulting in a global pandemic. Countermeasures taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic included virtual and hybrid schooling in many jurisdictions throughout the United States of America ("U.S.") and Canada. The uncertainty of when and how schools would open materially affected demand for new buses and replacement/maintenance parts during the second half of fiscal 2020 and first half of fiscal 2021, significantly impacting our business and operations. 
 
 Demand for school buses strengthened substantially during the second half of fiscal 2021 as COVID-19 vaccines were administered and many jurisdictions began preparing for a return to in-person learning environments for the new school year that began in mid-August to early September 2021. However, during this same period of time, the Company, and automotive industry as a whole, began experiencing significant supply chain constraints resulting from, among others, labor shortages; the lack of maintenance on, and acquisition of, capital assets by suppliers during the extended COVID-19 global lockdowns; significant increased demand for consumer products containing certain materials required for the production of vehicles, such as microchips, as consumers spent stimulus and other funds on items for their homes; etc. These supply chain disruptions had a significant adverse impact our operations and results during the second half of fiscal 2021 and all of fiscal 2022 due to higher purchasing costs, including freight costs incurred to expedite receipt of critical components, increased manufacturing inefficiencies and our inability to complete the production of buses to fulfill sales orders. Towards the end of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, there were slight improvements in the supply chain's ability to deliver the parts and components necessary to support our production operations, resulting in increased (i) manufacturing efficiencies and (ii) production of buses to fulfill sales orders during fiscal 2023. However, the higher costs charged by suppliers to procure inventory that continued into fiscal 2023 had a significant adverse impact on our operations and results. Specifically, such cost increases outpaced the increases in sales prices that we charged for the buses that were sold during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, many of which were included in the backlog of fixed price sales orders originating in fiscal 2021 and the early months of fiscal 2022 that carried forward into fiscal 2023. During the remainder of fiscal 2023, the buses that were sold were generally included in the backlog of fixed price sales orders originating more recently (i.e., the latter months of fiscal 2022 and in fiscal 2023), with the cumulative increases in sales prices we charged for those buses generally outpacing the higher costs we paid to procure inventory, resulting in gross profit during the quarters. While the gross margin on bus sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 lagged the historical gross margin reported prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it returned to more normal historical levels during the latter half of fiscal 2023. 
 
 Additionally, Russian military forces launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, which further exacerbated global supply chain disruptions. While the Company has no assets or customers in either of these countries, this military conflict significantly impacted our financial results during the second half of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, primarily in an indirect manner since the Company does not sell to customers located in, or source goods directly from, either country. Specifically, it has contributed to increased a) costs charged by suppliers for the purchase of inventory that is at least partially dependent on resources originating from either of the countries and b) freight costs, both of which negatively impacted the gross profit recognized on sales during the second half of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023. 
 
 61 

Significant uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude and duration of the pandemic and subsequent supply chain constraints and accordingly, precludes any prediction as to the ultimate severity of the adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.

 The outstanding balance of deferred warranty income in the table above is considered a "contract liability," and represents a performance obligation of the Company that we satisfy over the term of the arrangement but for which we have been paid in full at the time the warranty was sold. We expect to recognize million of the outstanding contract liability in fiscal 2024, and the remaining balance thereafter. 
 
 Other Current Liabilities 
 
 The balance in other current liabilities as of September 30, 2023 includes approximately million of funds awarded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in administering the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act IIJA that was signed into law in mid-November 2021. The IIJA allocates federal funds to help local school jurisdictions purchase zero and low emission school buses over a five year period.

 Derivative Instruments 
 
 We are charged variable rates of interest on our indebtedness outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement (defined in Note 8) which exposes us to fluctuations in interest rates. On October 24, 2018, the Company entered into a interest rate collar with a million notional value with an effective date of November 30, 2018. The collar was entered into in order to partially mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our variable rate debt. The collar established a range where we paid the counterparty if the three month LIBOR rate fell below the established floor rate of , and the counterparty paid us if the three month LIBOR rate exceeded the ceiling rate of . The collar settled quarterly through the termination date of September 30, 2022. No payments or receipts were exchanged on the interest rate collar contracts unless interest rates rose above or fell below the contracted ceiling or floor rates. Throughout much of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, the three month LIBOR rate fell below the established floor, which required us to make million and million in total cash payments to the counterparty in each fiscal year, respectively.

Finite lived: Customer relationships Total amortized intangible assets Indefinite lived: Trade name Total intangible assets 
 
 Management considers the "Blue Bird" trade name to have an indefinite useful life and, accordingly, it is not subject to amortization. Management reached this conclusion principally due to the longevity of the Blue Bird name and because management considers renewal upon reaching the legal limit of the trademarks related to the trade name as perfunctory. The Company expects to maintain usage of the trade name on existing products and introduce new products in the future that will also display the trade name. During the fourth quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we performed our annual impairment assessment of our trade name, which did not indicate that an impairment existed; therefore, impairment of our indefinite lived intangible has been recorded. 
 
 Customer relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated life of years. Engineering designs are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated life of years. Total amortization expense for intangible assets was million, million, and million for fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021, respectively.

The revolving credit facility included a million letter of credit sub-facility and a million swing-line sub-facility Revolving Credit Facility, and together with the Term Loan Facility, each a Credit Facility and collectively, the Credit Facilities ). The obligations under the Credit Agreement and the related loan documents (including without limitation, the borrowings under the Credit Facilities and obligations in respect of certain cash management and hedging obligations owing to the agents, the lenders or their affiliates), are, in each case, secured by a lien on and security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries including the Borrower, with certain exclusions as set forth in a collateral agreement entered into on the closing date.

 The First Amended Credit Agreement also increased the revolving credit facility to million from million, a million increase. The amendment extended the maturity date to September 13, 2023, from the effective date of the first amendment. The first amendment also amended the interest rate pricing matrix (as follows) as well as the principal payment schedule (which was subsequently amended as discussed below). In connection with the First Amended Credit Agreement, we incurred million of debt discount and issuance costs, which were recorded as contra-debt and are being amortized over the life of the Amended Credit Agreement (defined below) using the effective interest method.

 Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement 
 
 On May 7, 2020, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement and First Amended Credit Agreement Second Amended Credit Agreement ). The Second Amended Credit Agreement provided million in additional revolving commitments bringing the total revolving commitments to million. The revolving commitments under the Second Amended Credit Agreement mature on September 13, 2023, which is the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the First Amended Credit Agreement. The interest rate pricing grid remained unchanged, but the LIBOR floor was amended from to . We incurred million in fees related to the amendment. The fees were capitalized to other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense until maturity of the Amended Credit Agreement (defined below). 
 
 Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement 
 
 On December 4, 2020, the Company executed a third amendment to the Credit Agreement, First Amended Credit Agreement and Second Amended Credit Agreement ("Third Amended Credit Agreement"). The Third Amended Credit Agreement, among other things, provided for certain temporary amendments to the Credit Agreement from the third amendment effective date through and including the first date on which (a)(i) a compliance certificate was timely delivered with respect to a fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2022 demonstrating compliance with certain financial performance covenants for such fiscal quarter (the Limited Availability Period ), or (ii) the Borrower elected to terminate the Limited Availability Period; and (b) the absence of a default or event of default. 
 
 Amendments to the financial performance covenants provided that during the Limited Availability Period, a higher maximum TNLR was permitted, and required the Company to maintain liquidity (in the form of undrawn availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) of at least million. For the duration between the fiscal quarter ended on or around December 31, 2020 and the fiscal quarter ended on or around September 30, 2021 that fell within the Limited Availability Period, a quarterly minimum consolidated EBITDA covenant applied instead of a maximum TNLR. 
 
 The pricing grid in the First Amended Credit Agreement, which was based on the ratio of the Company s consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA, remained unchanged. However, during the Limited Availability Period, an additional margin of applied. 
 
 During the Limited Availability Period, the Amended Credit Agreement required that Borrower prepay existing revolving loans and, if undrawn and unreimbursed letters of credit exceeded million, cash collateralize letters of credit if unrestricted cash and cash equivalents exceeded million, as determined on a semimonthly basis. Any issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension of credit 
 71 

million, or cause the aggregate outstanding Revolving Credit Facility principal to exceed million. The Third Amended Credit Agreement also implemented a cap on permissible investments, restricted payments, certain payments of indebtedness and the fair market value of all assets subject to permitted dispositions during the Limited Availability Period. 
 
 For the duration of the Limited Availability Period, the Amended Credit Agreement set forth additional monthly reporting requirements, and required subordination agreements and intercreditor arrangements for certain other indebtedness and liens subject to administrative agent approval. 
 
 The Company incurred approximately million in lender fees and other issuance costs relating to the third amendment. Of such total, approximately million and million was capitalized within other assets and long-term debt (as a contra-balance), respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense on a straight-line basis and utilizing the effective interest method, respectively, until maturity of the Amended Credit Agreement (defined below). The remaining approximate million was recorded to loss on debt modification on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 In conjunction with executing the third amendment, previously capitalized lender fees and other issuance costs incurred in prior periods totaling approximately million were expensed to loss on debt modification on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement 
 
 On November 24, 2021, the Company executed a fourth amendment to the Credit Agreement, First Amended Credit Agreement, Second Amended Credit Agreement and Third Amended Credit Agreement (the "Fourth Amended Credit Agreement"). The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement, among other things, provided for certain temporary amendments to the Credit Agreement from the third amendment effective date through and including (a) April 1, 2023 (the Amended Limited Availability Period ), or (b) the first date on which Borrower elected to terminate the Amended Limited Availability Period, in each case, subject to (x) the absence of a default or event of default and (y) pro forma compliance with the financial covenant performance covenants under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement. 
 
 With respect to the financial performance covenants, during the Amended Limited Availability Period for the fiscal quarters ended January 1, 2022 through October 1, 2022, the TNLR requirement was not applicable, although it continued to impact the interest rate that was charged on outstanding borrowings as discussed below. 
 
 Fiscal quarter ending April 2, 2022 ) Fiscal quarter ending July 2, 2022 ) Fiscal quarter ending October 1, 2022 
 
 However, in the event that Borrower elected to terminate the Amended Limited Availability Period in fiscal 2022, the maximum TNLR permitted was 3.50x. 
 
 January 2, 2022 through April 2, 2022 April 3, 2022 through July 2, 2022 Thereafter 
 
 Additionally, a new financial performance covenant was added in the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement, requiring that school bus units manufactured by the Company Units not fall below the pre-set thresholds set forth in the table below on a three month trailing basis Units Covenant ). 
 72 

Three month period ending January 1, 2022 Three month period ending January 29, 2022 Three month period ending February 26, 2022 Three month period ending April 2, 2022 Three month period ending April 30, 2022 Three month period ending May 28, 2022 Three month period ending July 2, 2022 Three month period ending July30, 2022 Three month period ending August 27, 2022 Three month period ending October 1, 2022 
 
 If the Units during any three fiscal month period set forth above was less than the minimum required by the Units Covenant, Borrower could elect to carry forward up to 50 of certain applicable excess Units to satisfy the Units Covenant requirement. However, Borrower could not make such election in two consecutive three fiscal month periods. 
 
 II Greater than or equal to 2.00x and less than 2.50x III Greater than or equal to 2.50x and less than 3.00x IV Greater than or equal to 3.00x and less than 3.25x V Greater than or equal to 3.25x and less than 3.50x VI Greater than or equal to 3.50x and less than 4.50x VII Greater than or equal to 4.50x and less than 5.00x VIII Greater than 5.00x 
 
 During the Amended Limited Availability Period (notwithstanding the pricing grid set forth above), the applicable rate was (a) solely to the extent that the aggregate revolving exposures exceeded million, with respect to such excess and (b) with respect to all other revolving exposures, the sum of the rate determined by the administrative agent in accordance with the pricing grid set forth above, plus . 
 
 Additional allowances were made in the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement for the Company to issue or incur up to million of qualified equity interests issued by the Company, unsecured subordinated indebtedness or unsecured convertible indebtedness (collectively, Junior Capital ). Upon the issuance or incurrence of any Junior Capital, the Company was required to prepay the outstanding revolving loans (with no permanent reduction in the revolving commitments) in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) 100 of the net proceeds from such Junior Capital and (b) the aggregate of revolving exposures then outstanding. Prior to the initial issuance or incurrence of any Junior Capital, any issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension of credit during the Amended Limited Availability Period could not cause the aggregate outstanding Revolving Credit Facility principal to exceed million Availability Cap ). Following the issuance and sale of million of common stock in a private placement transaction on December 15, 2021 (see Note 13, Stockholders' (Deficit) Equity , for further details), the Availability Cap was permanently reduced to million. 
 
 For the duration of the Amended Limited Availability Period, the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement set forth additional monthly reporting requirements in connection with the manufactured school bus units required by the financial performance covenants, when applicable. 
 
 The Company incurred approximately million in lender fees and other issuance costs relating to the fourth amendment. Of such total, approximately million and million was capitalized within other assets and long-term debt (as a contra-balance), respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be amortized as an adjustment to interest expense on a straight-line basis and utilizing the effective interest method, respectively, until maturity of the Amended Credit Agreement (defined below). The remaining approximate million was recorded to loss on debt modification on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

million were also expensed to loss on debt modification on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Fifth Amendment and Limited Waiver to the Credit Agreement 
 
 On September 2, 2022, the Company executed a fifth amendment and limited waiver to the Credit Agreement, First Amended Credit Agreement, Second Amended Credit Agreement, Third Amended Credit Agreement and Fourth Amended Credit Agreement ("Fifth Amended Credit Agreement"). The Fifth Amended Credit Agreement, among other things, resulted in Borrower and administrative agent jointly electing an early opt-in to change one of the market interest rate indices that Borrower can elect to accrue interest on outstanding borrowings from LIBOR, which was discontinued subsequent to June 30, 2023, to SOFR. Such change became effective at the end of the applicable interest period for any LIBOR borrowings outstanding on the fifth amendment effective date. 
 
 The Fifth Amended Credit Agreement also provided covenant relief, through December 31, 2022, via a waiver of the million minimum consolidated EBITDA covenant calculated on a four quarter trailing basis for the fiscal quarter ended October 1, 2022 and the minimum Units Covenant calculated on a three fiscal month trailing basis for the fiscal month ended October 1, 2022. The Company requested such covenant relief given the supply chain disruptions that continued to challenge the Company throughout fiscal 2022. 
 
 Finally, the Fifth Amended Credit Agreement requires the Company to provide a rolling thirteen week cash flow forecast to the administrative agent, on a monthly basis, beginning with the fiscal month ended August 27, 2022 and ending with the fiscal month ending April 1, 2023. 
 
 The Company incurred approximately million in lender fees and other issuance costs relating to the fifth amendment. Of such total, approximately million and million was capitalized within other assets and long-term debt (as a contra-balance), respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be amortized as an adjustment to interest expense on a straight-line basis and utilizing the effective interest method, respectively, until maturity of the Amended Credit Agreement. The remaining approximate million was recorded to loss on debt modification on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement 
 
 On November 21, 2022, the Company executed a sixth amendment to the Credit Agreement, First Amended Credit Agreement, Second Amended Credit Agreement, Third Amended Credit Agreement, Fourth Amended Credit Agreement and Fifth Amended Credit Agreement ("Sixth Amended Credit Agreement" and collectively, the "Amended Credit Agreement"). The Sixth Amended Credit Agreement, among other things, extends the maturity date for both the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility from September 13, 2023 to December 31, 2024. The total Revolving Credit Facility commitment is reduced to an aggregate principal amount of million, of which million is available for Borrower to draw, with the remaining million subject to written approval from the lenders, which, once obtained, will be irrevocable. There was no change in the Term Loan Facility commitment; however, the Sixth Amended Credit Agreement requires principal repayments approximating million on a quarterly basis through September 30, 2024, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. There were million of term loan borrowings outstanding on the sixth amendment effective date. 
 
 The Sixth Amended Credit Agreement also provides for temporary amendments to certain financial performance covenants during the Amended Limited Availability Period, which will terminate on the date on which the Company s TNLR for the two fiscal quarters most recently ended is each less than 4.00x and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. However, the Amended Limited Available Period can re-occur upon a default or event of default or if the TNLR for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is equal to or greater than 4.00x.

 The Company is not required to comply with a maximum TNLR financial maintenance covenant for any fiscal quarters from the sixth amendment effective date through September 30, 2023, with the maximum threshold amended thereafter as follows : 
 
 Period Maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio Fiscal Quarter ending December 30, 2023 through the fiscal quarter ending March 30, 2024 4.00:1.00 Fiscal quarter ending June 29, 2024 and thereafter 3.50:1.00 
 
 The pricing grid in the Amended Credit Agreement, which is based on the TNLR, is applicable to both term loan and revolving borrowings and is determined in accordance with the amended pricing matrix set forth below: 
 
 Level Total Net Leverage Ratio ABR Loans SOFR Loans I Less than 2.00x II Greater than or equal to 2.00x and less than 2.50x III Greater than or equal to 2.50x and less than 3.00x IV Greater than or equal to 3.00x and less than 3.25x V Greater than or equal to 3.25x and less than 3.50x VI Greater than or equal to 3.50x and less than 4.00x VII Greater than or equal to 4.00x and less than 4.50x VIII Greater than or equal to 4.50x and less than 5.00x IX Greater than 5.00x 
 
 Further, the pricing margins for levels VII though IX above are each increased (x) by if the aggregate revolving borrowings are equal to or greater than million and less than or equal to million and (y) by if the aggregate revolving borrowings are greater than million. On the sixth amendment effective date, the interest rate was set at SOFR plus and was adjusted, as applicable, for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022 and subsequently in accordance with the amended pricing grid set forth above.

 Term loans are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the unpaid principal balance, and are not subject to fair value measurement; however, given the variable rates on the loans, the Company estimates the unpaid principal balance to approximate fair value. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, the term loans would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, million and million, respectively, were outstanding on the term loans.

No portion of the options vest and become exercisable after the date on which the optionee s service with the Company and its subsidiaries terminates. The vesting of all unvested shares of common stock subject to an option will automatically be accelerated in connection with a Change in Control, as defined in the Plan. 
 
 New shares of the Company's common stock are issued upon stock option exercises, or at the time of vesting for restricted stock. We have granted performance awards as part of our overall compensation plans. The vesting of these awards is primarily based upon the attainment of certain performance metrics established under our annual Management Incentive Plan ("MIP"), with the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors maintaining final discretion over vesting amounts. Stock-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units ("RSU"), are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value. The fair value of each stock option award on the grant date is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, weighted-average risk-free interest rate and weighted average expected term of the options. Because we do not have sufficient history with respect to stock option activity and post-vesting cancellations, the expected term assumption is based on the simplified method under U.S. GAAP, which is based on the vesting period and contractual term for each vesting tranche of awards. The mid-point between the vesting date and the expiration date is used as the expected term under this method. The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes model is based on the implied yield curve available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues at the date of grant with a remaining term equal to the Company s expected term assumption. The Company has never declared or paid a cash dividend on its common stock. Restricted stock and RSUs are valued based on the intrinsic value of the difference between the exercise price, if any, of the award and the fair market value of our

 Fair Value of Plan Assets: The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments in accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the ASC. Fair value represents the price to hypothetically sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly manner in the principal market for that asset or liability. This topic provides a hierarchy that gives highest priority to unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This topic requires that financial assets and liabilities are classified into one of the following three categories: 
 Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability Level 3 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
 
 The Company evaluates fair value measurement inputs on an ongoing basis in order to determine if there is a change of sufficient significance to warrant a transfer between levels. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized on the actual date of the event or circumstances that caused the transfer, which generally coincides with the Company's valuation process. 
 
 The Defined Benefit Plan assets are comprised of various investment funds, which are valued based upon their quoted market prices. The invested pension plan assets of the Defined Benefit Plan are all Level 2 assets under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements ASC 820 ). During fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, there were no transfers between levels. There are no sources of significant concentration risk in the invested assets at September 30, 2023.

 The estimated net loss for the Defined Benefit Plan that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is million. The unrecognized gain or loss is amortized as follows: the total unrecognized gain or loss, less the larger of 10 of the liability or 10 of the assets, is divided by the average future working lifetime of active plan participants.

 The benchmark for the discount rates is an estimate of the single equivalent discount rate determined by matching the Defined Benefit Plan s future expected cash flows to spot rates from a yield curve comprised of high-quality corporate bond rates of various durations. 
 
 Debt securities Total securities 
 
 There was no Company common stock included in equity securities. Assets of the Defined Benefit Plan are invested primarily in funds that further invest in equity or debt securities. Assets are valued using quoted prices in active markets. 
 
 The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the PBO. In estimating that rate, appropriate consideration is given to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the fund and rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment and a building block method. The expected rate of return on each asset class is broken down into three components: (1) inflation, (2) the real risk-free rate of return (i.e., the long-term estimate of future returns on default free U.S. government securities), and (3) the risk premium for each asset class (i.e., the expected return in excess of the risk-free rate). 
 
 The investment strategy for pension plan assets is to limit risk through asset allocation, diversification, selection and timing. Assets are managed on a total return basis, with dividends and interest reinvested in the account.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
 
 None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 
 In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of September 30, 2023 on the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this Report. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on management's assessment and those criteria, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued its report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 4.10 

 DESCRIPTION OF REGISTRANT S SECURITIES 
 Authorized and Outstanding Securities 
 Our charter authorizes the issuance of 110.0 million shares, consisting of 100.0 million shares of Common Stock, 0.0001 par value per share, and 10.0 million shares of preferred stock, 0.0001 par value. The outstanding shares of our Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. 
 Common Stock 
 Our charter provides that the Common Stock will have identical rights, powers, preferences and privileges. 
 Voting Power 
 Except as otherwise required by law or as otherwise provided in any certificate of designation for any series of preferred stock, the holders of Common Stock possess all voting power for the election of our directors and all other matters requiring stockholder action. Holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters to be voted on by stockholders. 
 Dividends 
 Holders of Common Stock will be entitled to receive such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors in its discretion out of funds legally available therefor. In no event will any stock dividends or stock splits or combinations of stock be declared or made on Common Stock unless the shares of Common Stock at the time outstanding are treated equally and identically. 
 Liquidation, Dissolution and Winding Up 
 In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding-up, the holders of the Common Stock will be entitled to receive an equal amount per share of all of our assets of whatever kind available for distribution to stockholders, after the rights of the holders of the preferred stock have been satisfied. 
 Preemptive or Other Rights 
 There are no preemptive rights, redemption provisions or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Common Stock. 
 Election of Directors 
 Our board of directors is divided into three separate classes with each class serving a three-year term. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50 of the shares voted for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. 
 Preferred Stock 
 Our charter provides that shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors will be authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, applicable to the shares of each series. Our board of directors will be able to, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the Common Stock and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of our company or the removal of existing management. 
 As of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, there were no shares of Preferred Stock outstanding. Shares of Series A Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock issued in connection with our 2015 business combination were either purchased by us or converted by us into Common Stock. 

Exhibit 4.10 

 Dividends 
 We have not paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends. In addition, certain of our loan agreements restrict the payment of dividends. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements, debt covenants and general financial condition. The payment of any cash dividends will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. 
 Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions Under our Charter and Pursuant to Delaware Law 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include 
 no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates 
 the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director with or without cause by stockholders, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors 
 subject to any rights of holders of existing preferred shares, the ability of our board of directors to determine whether to issue shares of our preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer 
 a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders 
 the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors 
 limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers 
 controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings 
 providing for a staggered board, in which the members of the board of directors are divided into three classes to serve for a period of three years from the date of their respective appointment or election 
 permitting the removal of directors with or without cause by stockholders voting a majority of the votes cast if, at any time and for so long as, American Securities LLC (through its affiliate ASP BB Holdings LLC) beneficially owns, in the aggregate, capital stock representing at least 40 of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock 
 advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company 
 requiring an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our entire board of directors and by the holders of at least 66.67 of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock in order to adopt an amendment to our certificate of incorporation if, at any time and for so long as, American Securities LLC (through its affiliate ASP BB Holdings LLC) beneficially owns, in the aggregate, capital stock representing at least 50 of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock and 

Exhibit 4.10 

 requiring an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our entire board of directors or by the holders of at least 66.67 of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock to amend our bylaws if, at any time and for so long as, American Securities LLC (through its affiliate ASP BB Holdings LLC) beneficially owns, in the aggregate, capital stock representing at least 50 of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. 
 These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our Company or changes in our board of directors and management. 
 As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL ), which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding Common Stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding Common Stock. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Common Stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Common Stock.

 Exhibit 19.1 

BLUE BIRD CORPORATION 
 INSIDER TRADING POLICY 
 EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2023 
 
 I. Purpose 
 
 This Insider Trading Policy (this Policy provides guidelines with respect to transactions in the securities of Blue Bird Corporation (the Company and the handling of confidential information about the Company and the companies with which the Company does business. The Company s Board of Directors has adopted this Policy to promote compliance with federal, state and foreign securities laws that prohibit certain persons who are aware of material nonpublic information about a company from (i) trading in securities of that company or (ii) providing material nonpublic information to other persons who may trade on the basis of that information. 
 
 II. Persons Subject to the Policy 
 
 This Policy applies to all officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, all members of the Company s Board of Directors and all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company may also determine that other persons should be subject to this Policy, such as contractors or consultants who have access to material nonpublic information. This Policy also applies to family members, other members of a person s household and entities controlled by a person covered by this Policy, as described below. 
 
 III. Transactions Subject to the Policy 
 
 This Policy applies to transactions in the Company s securities (collectively referred to in this Policy as Company Securities ), including the Company s common stock, options to purchase common stock, or any other type of securities that the Company may issue, including, but not limited to, preferred stock, convertible debentures and warrants, as well as derivative securities that are not issued by the Company, such as exchange-traded put or call options or swaps relating to the Company s securities. Transactions subject to this Policy include purchases, sales and bona fide gifts of Company Securities. Upon implementation of this Policy, the Company had the following types of Company Securities outstanding common stock, options to purchase common stock, and restricted stock units. 
 
 IV. Individual Responsibility 
 
 Persons subject to this Policy have ethical and legal obligations to maintain the confidentiality of information about the Company and to not engage in transactions in Company Securities while in possession of material nonpublic information. Persons subject to this Policy must not engage in illegal trading and must avoid the appearance of improper trading. Each individual is responsible for making sure that he or she complies with this Policy, and that any family member, household member or entity whose transactions are subject to this Policy, as discussed below, also complies with this Policy. 
 
 In all cases, the responsibility for determining whether an individual is in possession of material nonpublic information rests with that individual, and any action on the part of the Company, the Compliance Officer or any other employee or director pursuant to this Policy (or otherwise) does not in any way constitute legal advice or insulate an individual from liability under applicable securities laws. You could be subject to severe legal penalties and disciplinary action by the Company for any conduct prohibited by this Policy or applicable securities laws, as described below in more detail under the heading Consequences of Violations. 

Exhibit 19.1 

 V. Administration of the Policy 
 
 The Senior Vice President and General Counsel shall serve as the Compliance Officer for the purposes of this Policy. In his or her absence, another employee designated by the Compliance Officer or the Company s Chief Executive Officer shall be responsible for administration of this Policy. All determinations and interpretations by the Compliance Officer shall be final and not subject to further review. The Board of Directors of the Company may name additional or different Compliance Officers in its discretion. 
 
 VI. Statement of Policy 
 
 It is the policy of the Company that no director, officer or other employee of the Company (or any other person designated by this Policy or by the Compliance Officer as subject to this Policy) who is aware of material nonpublic information relating to the Company may, directly, or indirectly through family members or other persons or entities 
 
 1. Engage in transactions in Company Securities, except as otherwise specified in this Policy under the headings Transactions Under Company Plans and Rule 10b5-1 Plans 
 
 2. Recommend that others engage in transactions in any Company Securities 
 
 3. Disclose material nonpublic information to persons within the Company whose jobs do not require them to have that information, or outside of the Company to other persons, including, but not limited to, family, friends, business associates, investors and expert consulting firms, unless any such disclosure is made in accordance with the Company s policies regarding the protection or authorized external disclosure of information regarding the Company or 
 
 4. Assist anyone engaged in the above activities. 
 
 In addition, it is the policy of the Company that no director, officer or other employee of the Company (or any other person designated as subject to this Policy) who, in the course of working for the Company, learns of material nonpublic information about a company (1) with which the Company does business, such as the Company s distributors, dealers, vendors, customers and suppliers, or (2) that is involved in a potential transaction or business relationship with the Company, may engage in transactions in that company s securities until the information becomes public or is no longer material. 
 
 It is also the policy of the Company that the Company will not engage in transactions in Company Securities while aware of material nonpublic information relating to the Company or Company Securities. 
 
 There are no exceptions to this Policy, except as specifically noted herein. Transactions that may be necessary or justifiable for independent reasons (such as the need to raise money for an emergency expenditure), or small transactions, are not excepted from this Policy. The securities laws do not recognize any mitigating circumstances, and, in any event, even the appearance of an improper transaction must be avoided to preserve the Company s reputation for adhering to the highest standards of conduct. 

Exhibit 19.1 

 VII. Definition of Material Nonpublic Information 
 
 Material Information . Information is considered material if a reasonable investor would consider that information important in making a decision to buy, hold or sell securities. Any information that could be expected to affect the Company s stock price, whether it is positive or negative, should be considered material. There is no bright-line standard for assessing materiality rather, materiality is based on an assessment of all of the facts and circumstances, and is often evaluated by enforcement authorities with the benefit of hindsight. While it is not possible to define all categories of material information, some examples of information that ordinarily would be regarded as material are 
 
 Projections of future earnings or losses, or other earnings guidance 
 Changes to previously announced earnings guidance, or the decision to suspend earnings guidance 
 A pending or proposed merger, acquisition or tender offer 
 A pending or proposed acquisition or disposition of a significant asset 
 A pending or proposed joint venture 
 A Company restructuring 
 Significant related party transactions 
 A change in dividend policy, the declaration of a stock split, or an offering of additional securities 
 Bank borrowings or other financing transactions out of the ordinary course 
 The establishment of a repurchase program for Company Securities 
 A major change in the Company s pricing or cost structure 
 Major marketing changes 
 An important change in senior executive management 
 A change in auditors or notification that the auditor s reports may no longer be relied upon 
 Development of a significant new product, process, or service 
 Pending or threatened significant litigation, or the resolution of such litigation 
 Impending bankruptcy or the existence of severe liquidity problems 
 The gain or loss of a particularly significant customer or supplier 
 A significant cybersecurity incident, such as a data breach, or any other significant disruption in the Company s operations or loss, potential loss, breach or unauthorized access of its property or assets, whether at its facilities or through its information technology infrastructure or 
 The imposition of an event-specific restriction on trading in Company Securities or the securities of another company (or extension or termination of such event-specific restriction). 
 
 When Information is Considered Public . Information that has not been disclosed to the public is generally considered to be nonpublic information. In order to establish that the information has been disclosed to the public, it is necessary to demonstrate that the information has been widely disseminated in a manner authorized by the Company. Information generally would be considered widely disseminated if it has been disclosed through the Dow Jones broad tape, newswire services, a broadcast on widely available radio or television programs, publication in a widely available newspaper, magazine or news website, publication (in certain circumstances) on social media (such as Twitter or Facebook), or public disclosure documents filed with the SEC that are available on the SEC s website. 
 
 By contrast , information would likely not be considered widely disseminated if it is available only to the Company s employees, or if it is only available to a select group of analysts, brokers and institutional investors. 
 
 Once information is widely disseminated, it is still necessary to afford the investing public with sufficient time to absorb the information. As a general rule, information should not be considered fully absorbed by the marketplace until the second business day after the day on which the information is 

Exhibit 19.1 

 released. If, for example, the Company were to make an announcement on a Monday, you should not trade in Company Securities until Wednesday. Depending on the particular circumstances, the Company may determine that a longer or shorter period should apply to the release of specific material nonpublic information. 
 
 VIII. Transactions by Family Members and Others 
 
 This Policy applies to your family members who reside with you (including a spouse, a child, a child away at college, stepchildren, grandchildren, parents, stepparents, grandparents, siblings and in-laws), anyone else who lives in your household, and any family members who do not live in your household but whose transactions in Company Securities are directed by you or are subject to your influence or control, such as parents or children who consult with you before they trade in Company Securities (collectively referred to as Family Members ). You are responsible for the transactions of these other persons and therefore should make them aware of the need to confer with you before they trade in Company Securities, and you should treat all such transactions for the purposes of this Policy and applicable securities laws as if the transactions were for your own account. This Policy does not, however, apply to personal securities transactions of Family Members where the purchase or sale decision is made by a third party not controlled by, influenced by or related to you or your Family Members. 

IX. Transactions by Entities that You Influence or Control 
 
 This Policy applies to any entities that you influence or control, including any corporations, partnerships or trusts (collectively referred to as Controlled Entities ), and transactions by these Controlled Entities should be treated for the purposes of this Policy and applicable securities laws as if they were for your own account. 
 
 X. Transactions Under Company Plans 
 
 This Policy does not apply in the case of the following transactions under certain existing or future Company benefit or equity incentive plans, except as specifically noted 
 
 Stock Option Exercises . This Policy does not apply to the exercise of an employee stock option acquired pursuant to the Company s plans, or to the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which a person has elected to have the Company withhold shares subject to an option to satisfy tax withholding requirements. This Policy does apply, however, to any sale of stock as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an option, or any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option. 
 
 Restricted Stock Restricted Stock Unit Awards . This Policy does not apply to the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units, or the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you elect to have the Company withhold shares of stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon such vesting. The Policy does apply, however, to any market sale of restricted stock. 
 
 Other Similar Transactions . Any other purchase of Company Securities directly from the Company or sales of Company Securities directly to the Company are not subject to this Policy. Further, transactions in mutual funds that are invested in Company Securities are not transactions subject to this Policy. 

Exhibit 19.1 

 XI. Special and Prohibited Transactions 
 
 The Company has determined that there is a heightened legal risk and or the appearance of improper or inappropriate conduct if the persons subject to this Policy engage in certain types of transactions. It therefore is the Company s policy that any persons covered by this Policy may not engage in any of the following transactions, or should otherwise consider the Company s preferences as described below 
 
 Short-Term Trading . Pursuant to certain provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, no director or executive officer of the Company may purchase and sell, or sell and purchase, Company Securities of the same class within any six-month period, at a profit. Such profits are forfeited to the Company by law. 
 
 Short Sales . Short sales of Company Securities i.e. , the sale of a security that the seller does not own) may evidence an expectation on the part of the seller that the securities will decline in value, and therefore have the potential to signal to the market that the seller lacks confidence in the Company s prospects. In addition, short sales may reduce a seller s incentive to seek to improve the Company s performance. For these reasons, short sales of Company Securities are prohibited. In addition, Section 16(c) of the Exchange Act prohibits officers and directors from engaging in short sales. (Short sales arising from certain types of hedging transactions are governed by the paragraph below captioned Hedging Transactions. 
 
 Hedging Transactions . Hedging or monetization transactions can be accomplished through a number of possible mechanisms, including through the use of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds. Such hedging transactions may permit a director, officer or employee to continue to own Company Securities obtained through employee benefit plans or otherwise, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, the director, officer or employee may no longer have the same objectives as the Company s other shareholders. Therefore, directors, officers and employees are prohibited from engaging in any such transactions. 
 
 Margin Accounts and Pledged Securities . Securities held in a margin account as collateral for a margin loan may be sold by the broker without the customer s consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged (or hypothecated) as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. Because a margin sale or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when the pledgor is aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise is not permitted to trade in Company Securities, directors and officers are prohibited from holding Company Securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging Company Securities as collateral for a loan. (Pledges of Company Securities arising from certain types of hedging transactions are governed by the paragraph above captioned Hedging Transactions. The Company may, in its discretion, grant exceptions to this prohibition when a person wishes to pledge Company Securities as collateral for a loan (not including margin debt) and clearly demonstrates the financial capacity to repay the loan without resorting to the pledged securities. Any person seeking such an exception must submit a request for approval to the Compliance Officer at least two weeks prior to the transaction, and such exception may be denied by the Compliance Officer, in his or her discretion, for any reason or no reason. 
 
 Standing and Limit Orders . Standing and limit orders (except standing and limit orders under approved Rule 10b5-1 Plans, as described below) create heightened risks for insider trading violations similar to the use of margin accounts. There is no control over the timing of purchases or sales that result from standing instructions to a broker, and as a result the broker could execute a transaction when a director, officer or other employee is in possession of material nonpublic information. The Company therefore discourages placing standing or limit orders on Company Securities. If a person subject to this Policy determines that they must use a standing order or limit order, the order should be limited to short 

Exhibit 19.1 

 duration and should otherwise comply with the restrictions and procedures outlined below under the heading Additional Procedures. 
 
 XII. Additional Procedures 
 
 The Company has established additional procedures in order to assist the Company in the administration of this Policy, to facilitate compliance with laws prohibiting insider trading while in possession of material nonpublic information, and to avoid the appearance of any impropriety. These additional procedures are applicable only to those individuals described below. 
 
 Pre-Clearance Procedures . The directors of the Company, all officers identified by the Company in SEC filings as executive officers of the Company, and all other persons designated by the Compliance Officer as being subject to these procedures, as well as the Family Members and Controlled Entities of such persons, may not engage in any transaction in Company Securities without first obtaining pre-clearance of the transaction from the Compliance Officer. A request for pre-clearance should be submitted to the Compliance Officer at least two business days in advance of the proposed transaction. The Compliance Officer is under no obligation to approve a transaction submitted for pre-clearance, and may determine not to permit the transaction. If a person seeks pre-clearance and permission to engage in the transaction is denied, then he or she must refrain from initiating any transaction in Company Securities, and must not inform any other person of the restriction. 
 
 When a request for pre-clearance is made, the requestor should carefully consider whether he or she may be aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company, and should describe fully those circumstances to the Compliance Officer. The requestor should also indicate whether he or she has effected any non-exempt opposite-way transactions within the past six months, and should be prepared to report the proposed transaction on an appropriate Form 4 or Form 5, if required. If the transaction involves a sale, the requestor should also be prepared to comply with SEC Rule 144 and file Form 144, if necessary, at the time of any sale. 
 
 Any transactions that have been pre-cleared must be effected within two business days of receipt of such pre-clearance, unless an exception is granted. Transactions not effected within the time limit are subject to pre-clearance again. Any persons effecting such transactions shall notify the Compliance Officer following completion of the transaction. 
 
 Quarterly Trading Restrictions . The directors of the Company, all officers identified by the Company in SEC filings as executive officers of the Company, and all other persons designated by the Compliance Officer as subject to this restriction, as well as their Family Members or Controlled Entities, may not conduct any transactions involving Company Securities (other than as specified by this Policy), during a Blackout Period beginning fifteen days prior to the end of each fiscal quarter and ending on the second business day following the date of the public release of the Company s earnings results for that quarter. In other words, these persons may only conduct transactions in Company Securities during the Window Period beginning on the second business day following the public release of the Company s quarterly earnings and ending fifteen days prior to the close of the next fiscal quarter. However, their ability to conduct transactions during the Window Period is subject to all of the other restrictions set forth in this Policy. 
 
 Event-Specific Trading Restriction Periods . From time to time, an event may occur that is material to the Company and is known by only a few directors, officers and or employees. So long as the event remains material and nonpublic, the persons designated by the Compliance Officer may not trade Company Securities. In addition, the Company s financial results may be sufficiently material in a particular fiscal quarter that, in the judgment of the Compliance Officer, designated persons should refrain from trading in Company Securities even sooner than the typical Blackout Period described 

Exhibit 19.1 

 above. In that situation, the Compliance Officer may notify these persons that they should not trade in Company Securities, without disclosing the reason for the restriction. The existence of an Event-Specific Trading Restriction Period or extension of a Blackout Period will not be announced to the Company as a whole, and should not be communicated to any other person. Even if the Compliance Officer has not designated you as a person who should not trade due to an event-specific restriction, you should not trade while aware of material nonpublic information. Exceptions will not be granted during an Event-Specific Trading Restriction Period. 
 
 Exceptions . The quarterly trading restrictions and event-driven trading restrictions do not apply to those transactions to which this Policy does not apply, as described above under the heading Transactions Under Company Plans. Further, the requirement for pre-clearance, the quarterly trading restrictions and event-specific trading restrictions do not apply to transactions conducted pursuant to approved Rule 10b5-1 plans, described under the heading Rule 10b5-1 Plans. 
 
 XIII. Rule 10b5-1 Plans 
 
 Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides a defense from insider trading liability under Rule 10b-5. In order to be eligible to rely on this defense, a person subject to this Policy must enter into a Rule 10b5-1 plan for transactions in Company Securities that meets certain conditions specified in the Rule (a Rule 10b5-1 Plan ). If the plan meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1, Company Securities may be purchased or sold without regard to certain insider trading restrictions. To comply with the Policy, a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be approved by the Compliance Officer and meet the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and the Company s Guidelines for Rule 10b5-1 Plans, which may be obtained from the Compliance Officer. 
 
 In general, a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be entered into at a time when the person entering into the plan is not aware of material nonpublic information. Once the plan is adopted, the person must not exercise any influence over the amount of securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded or the date of the trade. The plan must either specify the amount, pricing and timing of transactions in advance or delegate discretion on these matters to an independent third party. 
 
 The plan must include a cooling-off period before trading can commence that, for directors and officers, ends on the later of 90 days after the adoption of the Rule 10b5-1 Plan or two business days following the disclosure of the Company s financial results in an SEC periodic report for the fiscal quarter in which the plan was adopted (but in any event, the required cooling-off period is subject to a maximum of 120 days after adoption of the plan), and for persons other than directors and officers, 30 days following adoption or modification of a Rule 10b5-1 Plan. A person may not enter into overlapping Rule 10b5-1 Plans (subject to certain exceptions) and may only enter into one single-trade Rule 10b5-1 Plan during any 12-month period (subject to certain exceptions). Directors and officers must include a representation in their Rule 10b5-1 Plan certifying that (i) they are not aware of any material nonpublic information and (ii) they are adopting the plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions in Rule 10b-5. All persons entering into a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must act in good faith with respect to such plan. 
 
 Any Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be submitted for approval five business days prior to the entry into the Rule10b5-1 Plan. No further pre-approval of transactions conducted pursuant to the Rule 10b5-1 Plan will be required. 
 
 XIV. Post-Termination Transactions 
 
 This Policy continues to apply to transactions in Company Securities even after termination of service with the Company (including non-employee directors). If an individual is in possession of 

Exhibit 19.1 

 material nonpublic information when his or her service terminates, that individual may not engage in transactions in Company Securities until that information has become public or is no longer material. The pre-clearance procedures specified under the heading Additional Procedures above and the quarterly trading restrictions will continue to apply to transactions in Company Securities until (i) the conclusion of a full fiscal quarter following the date of termination of service and the expiration of any Blackout Period applicable to such fiscal quarter, and (ii) the expiration of any other Company-imposed Event-Specific Trading Restriction Period applicable at the date of termination of service, if any. 
 
 XV. Consequences of Violations 
 
 The purchase or sale of Company Securities while aware of material nonpublic information, or the disclosure of material nonpublic information to others who then trade in Company Securities, is prohibited by federal and state laws, as well as the laws of foreign jurisdictions. Insider trading violations are pursued vigorously by the SEC, U.S. Attorneys, state enforcement authorities, as well as enforcement authorities in foreign jurisdictions. 
 
 Punishment for insider trading violations is severe, and could include significant fines and imprisonment. While the regulatory authorities concentrate their efforts on the individuals who trade, or who tip inside information to others who trade, the federal securities laws also impose potential liability on companies and other controlling persons if they fail to take reasonable steps to prevent insider trading by company personnel. 
 
 In addition, an individual s failure to comply with this Policy may subject the individual to Company-imposed sanctions, including dismissal for cause, whether or not the employee s failure to comply results in a violation of law. Needless to say, a violation of law, or even an SEC investigation that does not result in prosecution, can tarnish a person s reputation and irreparably damage a career. 
 
 XVI. Company Assistance 
 
 Any person who has a question about this Policy or its application to any proposed transaction may obtain additional guidance from the Compliance Officer, who can be reached by telephone at (478) 822-2429, or by e-mail at Ted.scartz blue-bird.com. 

XVII. Receipt, Acknowledgment and Certification 
 
 All persons subject to this Policy will be notified of the existence and availability of the Policy. Certain persons designated by the Compliance Officer must further certify their understanding of, and intent to comply with, this Policy.

Exhibit 19.1 

 Guidelines for Rule 10b5-1 Plans 
 Blue Bird Corporation 
 (included as part of the Insider Trading Policy) 
 Effective June 1, 2023 
 
 Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides a defense from insider trading liability under Rule 10b-5. In order to be eligible to rely on this defense, a person subject to our Insider Trading Policy (the Policy must enter into a Rule 10b5-1 plan for transactions in Company Securities (as defined in the Policy) that meets certain conditions specified in the Rule (a Rule 10b5-1 Plan ). If the plan meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1, transactions in Company Securities may occur without regard to certain insider trading restrictions. In general, a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be entered into at a time when the person entering into the plan is not aware of material nonpublic information. 
 
 Once the plan is adopted, the person must not exercise any influence over the amount of securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded or the date of the trade. The plan must either specify the amount, pricing and timing of transactions in advance or delegate discretion on these matters to an independent third party. 
 
 A Rule 10b5-1 Plan must include a cooling-off period before trading can commence that, for directors or officers, ends on the later of 90 days after the adoption of the Rule 10b5-1 Plan or two business days following the disclosure of the Company s financial results in an SEC periodic report for the fiscal quarter in which the plan was adopted (but in any event, the required cooling-off period is subject to a maximum of 120 days after adoption of the plan), and for persons other than directors or officers, 30 days following the adoption or modification of a Rule 10b5-1 Plan. 
 
 A person may not enter into overlapping Rule 10b5-1 Plans (subject to certain exceptions) and may only enter into one single-trade Rule 10b5-1 Plan during any 12-month period (subject to certain exceptions). Directors and officers must include a representation in their Rule 10b5-1 Plan certifying that (i) they are not aware of any material nonpublic information and (ii) they are adopting the plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions in Rule 10b-5. All persons entering into a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must act in good faith with respect to that plan. 
 
 As specified in the Company s Insider Trading Policy, a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be approved by the Compliance Officer and meet the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and these guidelines. Any Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be submitted for approval five business days prior to the entry into the Rule 10b5-1 Plan. No further pre-approval of transactions conducted pursuant to the Rule 10b5-1 Plan will be required. 
 The following guidelines apply to all Rule 10b5-1 Plans 
 You may not enter into, modify or terminate a Rule 10b5-1 Plan during a Blackout Period (as described in the Policy), an Event-Specific Trading Restriction Period (as described in the Policy) or otherwise while you are aware of material nonpublic information. 
 All Rule 10b5-1 Plans must have a duration of at least 6 months and no more than 2 years. 
 For officers and directors, no transaction may take place under a Rule 10b5-1 Plan until the later of (a) 90 days after adoption or modification (as specified in Rule 10b5-1) of the Rule 10b5-1 Plan or (b) two business days following the disclosure of the Company s financial results in a Form 10-Q or Form 10-K for the fiscal quarter (the Company s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of a Form 10-K) in which the Rule 10b5-1 Plan was adopted or modified (as specified in Rule 10b5-1). In any event, the cooling-off period is subject to a maximum of 120 days after adoption modification of the plan. 

Exhibit 19.1 

 For persons other than officers and directors, no transaction may take place under a Rule 10b5-1 Plan until 30 days following the adoption or modification (as specified in Rule 10b5-1) of a Rule 10b5-1 Plan. 
 Subject to certain limited exceptions specified in Rule 10b5-1, you may not enter into more than one Rule 10b5-1 Plan at the same time. 
 Subject to certain limited exceptions specified in Rule 10b5-1, you are limited to only one Rule 10b5-1 Plan designed to effect an open market purchase or sale of the total amount of securities subject to the Rule 10b-1 Plan as a single transaction in any 12-month period. 
 You must act in good faith with respect to a Rule 10b5-1 Plan. A Rule 10b5-1 Plan cannot be entered into as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b-5. Therefore, although modifications to an existing Rule 10b5-1 Plan are not prohibited, a Rule 10b5-1 Plan should be adopted with the intention that it will not be amended or terminated prior to its expiration. 
 Officers and directors must include a representation to the Company at the time of adoption or modification of a Rule 10b5-1 Plan that (i) the person is not aware of material nonpublic information about the Company or Company Securities and (ii) the person is adopting the plan in good faith and not as part of plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b-5. 
 You may not enter into any transaction in Company Securities while the Rule 10b5-1 Plan is in effect. 
 
 The Company and the Company s officers and directors must make certain disclosures in SEC filings concerning Rule 10b5-1 Plans. Officers and directors of the Company must undertake to provide any information requested by the Company regarding Rule 10b5-1 Plans for the purpose of providing the required disclosures or any other disclosures that the Company deems to be appropriate under the circumstances. 
 
 Each director, officer and other Section 16 insider understands that the approval or adoption of a pre-planned selling program in no way reduces or eliminates such person s obligations under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, including such person s disclosure and short-swing trading liabilities thereunder. If any questions arise, such person should consult with his or her own counsel in implementing a Rule 10b5-1 Plan.

This Policy is intended to comply with, and shall be interpreted to be consistent with, Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act Rule 10D-1 and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608 (the Listing Rule ). Unless otherwise defined in this Policy, capitalized terms shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in Section 2 of this Policy. 
 
 1. Administration. 
 
 Except as specifically set forth herein, this Policy shall be administered by the Board or, if so designated by the Board, a committee thereof (the Board or such committee charged with administration of this Policy, the Administrator ). The Administrator is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate or advisable for the administration of this Policy. All determinations and decisions made by the Administrator pursuant to the provisions of this Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all affected persons. Any action or inaction by the Administrator with respect to an Executive Officer under this Policy in no way limits the Administrator s actions or decisions not to act with respect to any other Executive Officer under this Policy or under any similar policy, agreement or arrangement, nor shall any such action or inaction serve as a waiver of any rights the Company may have against any Executive Officer. 
 
 In the administration of this Policy, the Administrator is authorized and directed to consult with the full Board or such other committees of the Board, such as the Board s Audit Committee or Compensation Committee (the Compensation Committee ), as may be necessary or appropriate as to matters within the scope of such other committee s responsibility and authority. Subject to any limitation under applicable law, the Administrator may authorize and empower any officer or employee of the Company to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Policy (other than with respect to any recovery under this Policy involving such officer or employee). 
 
 2. Definitions . 
 
 a. Accounting Restatement means an accounting restatement of the Company s financial statements due to the Company s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. 
 b. Accounting Restatement Date means the earlier to occur of (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement or (ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. 
 c. Administrator has the meaning set forth in Section 1 of this Policy. 
 d. Applicable Period means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Accounting Restatement Date, as well as any transition period that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year within or immediately following such three completed fiscal years provided, however , that a transition period between the last day of the Company s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to twelve months shall be deemed a completed fiscal year. 
 e. Erroneously Awarded Compensation has the meaning set forth in Section 5 of this Policy. 

Exhibit 97.1 

 f. Executive Officer means the Company s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. Executive officers of the Company s parent(s) or subsidiaries are deemed Executive Officers if they perform such policy making functions for the Company. Policy-making function is not intended to include policy-making functions that are not significant. Identification of an Executive Officer for purposes of this Policy would include at a minimum executive officers identified pursuant to 17 C.F.R. 229.401(b). 
 g. A Financial Reporting Measure is any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measure that is derived wholly or in part from such measure provided, however , that a Financial Reporting Measure is not required to be presented within the Company s financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC to qualify as a Financial Reporting Measure. Financial Reporting Measures include, but are not limited to, the following (and any measures derived from the following) Company stock price total stockholder return revenues net income profitability of one or more reportable segments financial ratios (e.g., accounts receivable turnover and inventory turnover rates) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), including Adjusted EBITDA as defined and used by the Company funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations liquidity measures, including Free Cash Flow as defined and used by the Company return measures (e.g., return on invested capital and return on assets) and earnings measures (e.g., earnings per share). 
 h. Incentive-Based Compensation means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. For purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed Received in the Company s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of such Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. For the avoidance of doubt, Incentive-Based Compensation that is subject to both a Financial Reporting Measure vesting condition and a service-based vesting condition shall be considered Received when the relevant Financial Reporting Measure is achieved, even if the Incentive-Based Compensation continues to be subject to the service-based vesting condition. 
 i. Nasdaq means The Nasdaq Stock Market. 
 j. SEC means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 3. Policy Application. 
 
 This Policy applies to all Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a person (i) after beginning service as an Executive Officer (ii) who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation (iii) while the Company had a listed class of securities on a national securities exchange and (iv) during the Applicable Period. 
 
 4. Policy Recovery Requirement. 
 
 In the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall recover, reasonably promptly, the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received by any Executive Officer, as calculated pursuant to Section 5 of this Policy, during the Applicable Period. 
 
 The Company s obligation to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy is not dependent on if or when the Company files with the SEC restated financial statements. Recovery under this Policy with respect to an Executive Officer shall not require the finding of any misconduct by such Executive Officer or such Executive Officer being found responsible for the accounting error leading to an Accounting Restatement. 

Exhibit 97.1 

 5. Erroneously Awarded Compensation. 
 
 The amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation subject to recovery under the Policy is the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation Received by the Executive Officer that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that would have been Received by the Executive Officer had it been determined based on the restated amounts. 
 
 Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be computed without regard to any taxes paid by the Executive Officer in respect of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation. 
 
 By way of example, with respect to any compensation plans or programs that take into account Incentive-Based Compensation, the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation subject to recovery under this Policy includes, but is not limited to, the amount contributed to any notional account based on Erroneously Awarded Compensation and any earnings accrued to date on that notional amount. 
 
 For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total stockholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement (i) the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total stockholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was Received and (ii) the Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq. 
 
 6. Method of Recoupment . 
 
 The Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion, the timing and method for promptly recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy, which may include, without limitation (i) seeking reimbursement of all or part of any cash or equity-based award (ii) cancelling prior cash or equity-based awards, whether vested or unvested or paid or unpaid (iii) cancelling or offsetting against any planned future cash or equity-based awards (iv) forfeiture of deferred compensation, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder and (v) any other method authorized by applicable law or contract. Subject to compliance with any applicable law, the Administrator may effect recovery under this Policy from any amount otherwise payable to the Executive Officer, including amounts payable to such individual under any otherwise applicable Company plan or program, including base salary, bonuses or commissions and compensation previously deferred by the Executive Officer. In addition, the applicable Executive Officer shall be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation. 
 
 The Company shall recover, and is authorized and directed pursuant to this Policy to recover, Erroneously Awarded Compensation in compliance with this Policy, except to the extent that the conditions set forth below in Sections 6(a) , 6(b) or 6(c) of this Policy are met, and the Compensation Committee (or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board) determines that recovery would be impracticable 
 
 a. The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover and provide that documentation to Nasdaq 
 b. Recovery would violate home country law of the issuer where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously 

Exhibit 97.1 

 Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law of the issuer, the Company must satisfy the applicable opinion and disclosure requirements of Rule 10D-1 and the Listing Rule or 
 c. Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. 
 
 7. No Indemnification of Executive Officers. 
 
 Notwithstanding the terms of any indemnification or insurance policy or any contractual arrangement with any Executive Officer that may be interpreted to the contrary, the Company is prohibited from indemnifying any Executive Officer or former Executive Officer against the loss of Erroneously Awarded Compensation, including any payment or reimbursement for the cost of third-party insurance purchased by any such Executive Officers to fund potential clawback obligations under this Policy. 
 
 8. Administrator Indemnification. 
 
 Any members of the Administrator, and any other members of the Board who assist in the administration of this Policy, shall not be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made with respect to this Policy and shall be fully indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent under applicable law and Company policy or agreements with respect to any such action, determination or interpretation. The foregoing sentence shall not limit any other rights to indemnification of the members of the Board under applicable law or Company policy or agreements. 
 
 9. Required Policy-Related Filings. 
 
 The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. federal securities laws, including disclosures required by applicable SEC filings. 
 
 10. Effective Date Retroactive Application. 
 
 This Policy shall be effective as of August 8, 2023 (the Effective Date ). The terms of this Policy shall apply to any Incentive-Based Compensation that is Received by Executive Officers on or after the Effective Date, even if such Incentive-Based Compensation was approved, awarded, granted or paid to Executive Officers prior to the Effective Date. Without limiting the generality of Section 6 of this Policy, and subject to applicable law, the Administrator may effect recovery under this Policy from any amount of compensation approved, awarded, granted, payable or paid to the Executive Officer prior to, on or after the Effective Date. 
 
 11. Severability. 
 
 The provisions in this Policy are intended to be applied to the fullest extent of the law.
