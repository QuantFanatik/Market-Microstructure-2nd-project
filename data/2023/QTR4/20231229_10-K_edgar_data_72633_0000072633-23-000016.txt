 Item 1. 
 Business . 

 (a) General Development
of Business . North European Oil Royalty Trust (the
"Trust") is a grantor trust which, on behalf of the owners of
units of beneficial interest in the Trust (the "unit owners"), holds
overriding royalty rights covering gas and oil production in certain
concessions or leases in the Federal Republic of Germany. The rights
are held under contracts with local German exploration and development
subsidiaries of ExxonMobil Corp. ("ExxonMobil") and the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group of Companies ("Royal Dutch/Shell Group"). Under
these contracts, the Trust receives various percentage royalties on
the proceeds of the sales of certain products from the areas involved.
At the present time, royalties are received for sales of gas well
gas, oil well gas, crude oil, condensate and sulfur. See Item 2 of
this annual report on Form 10-K (this "Report") for descriptions of the
relationships of these companies and certain of these contracts. 

 The royalty rights were
received by the Trust from North European Oil Company (the "Company")
upon dissolution of the Company in September 1975. The Company was
organized in 1957 as the successor to North European Oil Corporation
(the "Corporation"). The Trust is administered by trustees (the
"Trustees") under an Agreement of Trust dated September 10, 1975, as
amended (the "Trust Agreement"). 

 Neither the Trust nor the
Trustees on behalf of the Trust conduct any active business activities
or operations. The function of the Trustees is to monitor, verify,
collect, hold, invest and distribute the royalty payments made to the
Trust. Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustees make quarterly
distributions of the net funds received by the Trust on behalf of
the unit owners, after making provisions to cover future anticipated
expenses. Funds temporarily held by the Trust prior to their
distribution are invested in an interest bearing money market account. 

 There has been no significant
change in the principal operation or purpose of the Trust during the
past fiscal year. 

 As part of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 ("SOX"), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
adopted rules implementing legislation concerning governance matters
for publicly held entities. The Trust is complying with the
requirements of the SEC and SOX and, at this time, the Trustees have
chosen not to request any relief from those provisions based on the
passive nature of the Trust but may do so in the future. Accordingly,
the Trustees have directed that certain of the additional
statements and disclosures set forth or incorporated by reference in
this Report, which the SEC requires of corporations, be made even
though such statements and disclosures might not now or in
the future be required to be made by the Trust. 

 In addition, the New York
Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), where units of beneficial interest of
the Trust are listed for trading, has additional corporate governance
rules as set forth in Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.
Most of the governance requirements promulgated by the NYSE are not
applicable to the Trust, which is a passive entity acting as a
royalty trust and holding only overriding royalty rights. The Trustees
have, however, chosen to constitute an Audit Committee and a
Compensation Committee but may not necessarily continue to do so in
the future. 

 (b) Narrative
Description of Business . Under the Trust Agreement,
the Trust conducts no active business operations and is restricted
to collection of income from royalty rights and distribution to unit
owners of the net income after payment of administrative and
related expenses. 

 The overriding royalty
rights held by the Trust are derived from contracts and agreements
originally entered into by German subsidiaries of the predecessor
Corporation during the early 1930s. The Trust's primary royalty
rights are based on a government granted concession and remain in
effect as long as there are continued production activities and/or
exploration efforts within the concession. It is generally
anticipated that production activities will continue as long as
they remain economically profitable. The Trust holds other royalty
rights, which are based on
leases which have passed their original expiration dates. These
leases remain in effect as long as there is continued production or
the lessor does not cancel the lease. Individual lessors will
normally not seek termination of the rights originally granted
because the leases provide for royalty payments to the lessors if
sales of oil or gas result from discoveries made on the leased
land. Additionally, termination by individual lessors would result
in the escheat of mineral rights to the applicable state. 

 Royalties are paid to the
Trust on sales from production under these leases and concessions on a
regular monthly or quarterly basis pursuant to the royalty agreements.
The Trust receives the royalty payments exclusively in Euros. After
the royalties have been deposited in the Trust's account with
Deutsche Bank in Germany, sufficient funds are reserved to handle any
outstanding or anticipated expenses and maintain a minimal balance of
12,000 Euros. The Trust then converts the remainder of Euro
denominated funds into United States ("U.S.") dollars based upon the
available exchange rates. Following this
conversion to U.S. dollars, the royalties are transferred
to the Trust's bank account in the U.S. The Trust does not engage in
activities to hedge against currency risk, and the fluctuations in the
conversion rate impact its financial results. Since the
actual royalty deposits are held as Euros for such a limited time, the
market risk with respect to these deposits is small. The Trust has not
experienced any difficulty in effecting the conversion of Euros into
U.S. dollars. 

 As the holder of overriding
royalty rights, the Trust has no legal ability, whether by contract or
operation of law, to compel production or exploration. Moreover, if
an operator should determine to terminate production in any concession
or lease area and to surrender the concession or lease, the royalty
rights for that area would thereby be terminated. Under certain
royalty agreements, it is a requirement that the Trust be advised of
any intention to surrender lease or concession rights. While the
Trust itself is precluded from undertaking any production activities,
possible residual rights might permit the Trust to take up a
surrendered concession or lease and attempt to retain a third-party
operator to develop such concession or lease. There is no assurance
that the Trust could find such a third party. 

 The exploration for and the
production of gas and oil is a speculative business. The Trust has no
means of ensuring continued income from its royalty rights at either
their present levels or otherwise. The Trust has no role in any of
the operating companies' decision-making processes, such as gas
pricing, gas sales or exploration, which can impact royalty income.
In addition, fluctuations in prices and supplies of gas and oil and
the effect these fluctuations might have on royalty income to the
Trust and on reserves net to the Trust cannot be accurately
projected. Finally, natural gas and crude oil are wasting assets.
While known reserves may increase as additional development adds
quantities to the reserve amount, the amount of known and unknown
reserves is finite and will decline over time. 

 While Germany has laws
relating to environmental protection, the Trustees do not
have detailed information concerning the present or possible effect
of such laws on operations in areas where the Trust holds royalty
rights on production and sale of products from those areas. The
Trustees were informed by the Trust's German consultant that on
July 8, 2016, a hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") law was passed in
Germany permitting fracking in sandstone at any depth. The law
requires that an environmental impact study be performed and that
permission by the relevant water authority be granted in order to
ensure the protection of drinking water supplies. Based upon an
analysis of the details of this law, the Trust's German consultant
has informed the Trust that fracking will be permitted in all
current productive zones within the Oldenburg concession (as
defined below) both due
to the depths involved and the nature of the productive zones.
However, the operating companies would still have to comply with
all regulatory requirements governing the use of fracking. The
failure by the operating companies to comply with all regulatory
requirements could affect the volume of gas, sulfur and oil
production by the operating companies and could adversely affect
the royalties paid to the Trust. 

 The Trust, in cooperation
with a parallel royalty owner (Unitarian Universalist Congregation
at Shelter Rock)("UUCSR")), arranges for periodic examinations of
the books and records of the operating companies to verify
compliance with the computation provisions of the applicable
agreements. As a cost savings measure, the royalty examination is
conducted on a biennial basis. From time to time, these
examinations disclose computational errors or errors from
inappropriate application of existing agreements and appropriate
adjustments are requested to be made. As a result of the
amendments to the Trust's royalty agreements which effect pricing
simplification (see Item 7 of this Report), examinations by the
Trust's German accountants have been simplified since these
examinations are primarily limited to the verification of the gas
quantities sold. Although these periodic examinations may also
disclose other matters that are subject to dispute between the
parties, these disputes have historically been resolved through
negotiations without the need for litigation. The Trust's
accountants in Germany began their examination of the
operating companies for calendar years 2021 and 2022 in October
2023 when the final sales figures and the German Border Import
gas Prices (see Item 7 of this Report) were both available. 

 (c) Financial
Information about Geographic Areas . In Item 2 of this
Report, there is a schedule (by product, geographic area, and
operating company) showing the royalty income received by the Trust
during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. 

 (d) Information
about our Trustees and Executive Officers . As
specified in the Trust Agreement, the affairs of the Trust are
managed by not more than five individual Trustees who receive
compensation determined under that same agreement. 

 One Trustee
is designated as Managing Trustee. Nancy J. Floyd Prue has served
in a non-executive capacity as Managing Trustee since March 13, 2023.
Ahron H. Haspel is independent and has been determined to be a
financial expert (both as defined in the SEC rules). Mr. Haspel
serves as Chairman for the Audit and Compensation Committees.
Lawrence A. Kobrin serves as Clerk to the Trustees. For these
services, each of these three individuals receives additional
compensation. Willard B. Taylor is the fourth Trustee. 

 Day-to-day matters are
handled by the Managing Director, John R. Van Kirk, who also serves
as CEO and CFO. Mr. Van Kirk has held the position of
Managing Director of the Trust since November 1990. In addition
to the Managing Director, the Trust has one administrative employee
in the U.S., whose title is Administrator. The number of total
employees of the Trust is two, and the number of full-time employees
is two. 

 The Trust and UUCSR have
retained the services of a consultant, an accounting firm
and a legal firm in Germany. The consultant has broad experience in
the petroleum industry and provides reports on a regular basis. The
accounting firm and the legal firm advise and represent as needed.
The Trust and the co-royalty holder share the costs of these services
in Germany. 

 (e) Available

http://www.neort.com. The Trust's Annual Reports, Form 10-K annual
reports, Form 10-Q quarterly reports and the Definitive Proxy
Statements are available through the Trust's website as soon as

 Properties . 

 The properties of the Trust,
which the Trust and Trustees hold pursuant to the Trust Agreement on
behalf of the unit owners, are overriding royalty rights on sales of
gas, sulfur and oil under a concession in the Federal Republic of
Germany (the "Oldenburg concession"). The Oldenburg concession covers
approximately 1,386,000 acres, is located in the German federal state
of Lower Saxony, and is the area from which natural gas, sulfur and oil
are extracted. The Oldenburg concession currently provides 100 
of all the royalties received by the Trust. The Oldenburg concession
is held by Mobil Erdgas-Erdol GmbH ("Mobil Erdgas"), a German operating
subsidiary of ExxonMobil, and by Oldenburgische Erdolgesellschaft
("OEG"). As a result of direct and indirect ownership, ExxonMobil owns
two-thirds of OEG and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies owns
one-third of OEG. BEB Erdgas und Erdol GmbH ("BEB"), a joint venture
in which ExxonMobil and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group each own 50 ,
administers the concession held by OEG. 

 In 2002, Mobil Erdgas and
BEB formed ExxonMobil Production Deutschland GmbH ("EMPG") to carry
out all exploration, drilling and production activities. All sales
activities upon which the calculation of royalties is based are still
handled by either Mobil Erdgas or BEB (the "operating companies"). 

 Under one set of rights
covering the western part of the Oldenburg concession (approximately
662,000 acres), the Trust receives a royalty payment of 4 on gross
receipts from sales by Mobil Erdgas of gas well gas, oil well gas,
crude oil and condensate (the "Mobil Agreement"). Under the Mobil
Agreement there is no deduction of costs prior to the calculation of
royalties from gas well gas and oil well gas, which together account
for approximately 100 of all the royalties under said agreement.
Historically, the Trust has received significantly greater royalty
payments under the Mobil Agreement (as compared to the OEG Agreement
described below) due to the higher royalty rate specified by that
agreement. 

 Under another set of rights
covering the entire Oldenburg concession and pursuant to the agreement
with OEG, the Trust receives royalties at the rate of 0.6667 on gross
receipts from sales by BEB of gas well gas, oil well gas, crude oil,
condensate and sulfur (removed during the processing of sour gas) less
a certain allowed deduction of costs (the "OEG Agreement"). Under the
OEG Agreement, 50 of the field handling and treatment costs as
reported for state royalty purposes are deducted from the gross sales
receipts prior to the calculation of the royalty to be paid to the
Trust. 

 The Trust is also entitled
under an agreement with Mobil Erdgas to receive a 2 royalty on gross
receipts of sales of sulfur obtained as a by-product of sour gas
produced from the western part of Oldenburg (the "Mobil Sulfur
Agreement"). The payment of the sulfur royalty is conditioned upon
sales of sulfur by Mobil Erdgas at a selling price above an agreed-upon
base price. This base price is adjusted annually by an inflation index.
When the average quarterly selling price falls below the indexed base
price, no sulfur royalties are paid by Mobil Erdgas. Sulfur royalties
paid under the Mobil Agreement totaled 34,586 and 316,527 during
fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

 There are two types of
natural gas found within the Oldenburg concession, sweet gas and sour
gas. Sweet gas has little or no contaminants and needs very minor
treatment before it can be sold. Sour gas, in comparison, must be
processed at the Grossenkneten desulfurization plant which commenced
operations in 1972. The desulfurization process removes hydrogen
sulfide and other contaminants before the clean gas can be sold. The
hydrogen sulfide in gaseous form is converted to sulfur in a solid
form and sold separately. 

 EMPG decommissioned one of
the remaining two sulfur processing units ("trains"). The
decommissioning was conducted during May-July 2023. For a period of
twenty-four days beginning on June 25, 2023, there was no through-put
at the plant while the shutdown of one train and the refurbishment and
maintenance of the remaining train were completed. The cost of this
work was approximately 50 million Euros. The plant is subject to an
ongoing schedule of inspections which may result in shutdowns while
required repairs are conducted. Full operation of the remaining train
is approximately 200 million cubic feet ("MMcf") per day following the
shutdown. It is expected that the single train will be sufficient to
handle sour gas production through-put from the concession. It is also
expected that operating expenses in the future may be reduced by this
measure. Since sour gas accounts for 71 of overall gas sales and 97 
of western gas sales, any future shutdown of the remaining train could
significantly impact royalty income. The Trust has insufficient data to
predict whether, when and to what extent any future shutdown may occur.

Exhibit 99.1 to this Report
is a report entitled Calculation of Cost Depletion Percentage for
the 2023 Calendar Year Based on the Estimate of Remaining Proved
Producing Reserves in the Northwest Basin of the Federal Republic of
Germany as of October 1, 2023 (the "Cost Depletion Report"). The
Cost Depletion Report, dated November 27, 2023, was prepared by
Graves & Co. Consulting, LLC, 1800 West Loop South, Suite 750,
Houston, Texas 77027 ("Graves & Co."). Graves & Co. is an
independent petroleum and natural gas consulting organization
specialized in analyzing hydrocarbon reserves.

The Cost Depletion Report
provides documentation supporting the calculation of the cost
depletion percentage for the 2023 calendar year based on the use of
certain production data and the estimated net proved producing
reserves as of October 1, 2023 for the primary area in which the
Trust holds overriding royalty rights. In order to permit timely
filing of the Cost Depletion Report and consistent with the practice
of the Trust in prior years, the information has been prepared for
the 12-month period ended September 30, 2023. While this is one
month prior to the end of the fiscal year of the Trust, the
information available for production and sales through the end of
September is the most complete information available at a date
early enough to permit the timely preparation of the various
reports required. Unit owners are referred to the full text of the
Cost Depletion Report contained herein for further details. 

 The cost depletion percentage
is prepared by Graves & Co. for the Trust's unit owners for tax
reporting purposes. The cost depletion percentage in that report for
calendar 2023 is 8.8130 . Specific details relative to the Trust's
income and expenses and cost depletion percentage as they apply to
the calculation of taxable income for the 2023 calendar year are
included on removable pages in the 2023 Annual Report. Additionally,
the tax reporting information for 2023 is available on the Trust's
website, http://www.neort.com/tax-letters.html. 

 The primary purpose of the
Cost Depletion Report is the preparation of the cost depletion
percentage for use by unit owners in their own tax reporting. The
only information provided to the Trust that can be utilized in the
calculation of the cost depletion percentage is current and
historical production and sales of proved producing reserves. For
the western half of the Oldenburg concession, the Trust receives
quarterly production and sales information on a well-by-well basis.
For the eastern half of the Oldenburg concession, the Trust receives
cumulative quarterly production and sales information on two general
areas. These general areas encompass numerous fields with varying
numbers of wells. Pursuant to the arrangements under which the
Trust holds royalty rights and the fact that the Trust is not
considered an operating company within Germany, the Trust has no
access to the operating companies' proprietary information
concerning producing field reservoir data. The Trustees have been
advised by their German counsel that publication of such information
is not required under applicable law in Germany and that the royalty
rights do not grant the Trust the right to require or compel the
release of such information. Efforts to obtain such
information from the operating companies have not been successful.
The information made available to the Trust by the operating
companies does not include any of the following: reserve estimates,
capitalized costs, production cost estimates, revenue projections,
producing field reservoir data (including pressure data, permeability,
porosity and thickness of producing zone) or other similar
information. While the limited information available to the Trust
permits the calculation of the cost depletion percentage, it does not
change the uncertainty with respect to the estimate of proved
producing reserves. In addition, it is impossible for the Trust or
its consultant to make estimates of proved undeveloped or probable
future net recoverable oil and gas by appropriate geographic
areas. 

 The Trust has the
authority to examine, but only for certain limited purposes, the
operating companies' sales and production from the royalty areas.
Both Graves & Co. and the Trustees believe the use of the material
available is appropriate and suitable for preparation of the cost
depletion percentage and the estimates described in the Cost Depletion
Report. The Trustees and Graves & Co. believe this report and these
estimates to be reasonable and appropriate but assume that these
estimates may vary from statistical estimates which could be made
if complete reservoir production information were available. The
limited information available makes it inappropriate to make
projections or estimates of proved or probable reserves of any
category or class other than the estimated net proved producing
reserves described in the Cost Depletion Report. 

 Attachment A of the Cost
Depletion Report shows a schedule of estimated net proved producing
reserves of the Trust's royalty properties, computed as of
October 1, 2023 and a five-year schedule of gas, sulfur and oil
sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, 2022, 2021,
2020 and 2019 computed from quarterly sales reports of operating
companies received by the Trust during such periods.

 Executive Summary 

 The Trust is a passive fixed
investment trust which holds overriding royalty rights, receives
income under those rights from certain operating companies, pays
its expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its unit
owners. As mandated by the Trust Agreement, distributions of income
are made on a quarterly basis. These distributions, as determined
by the Trustees, constitute substantially all the funds on hand
after provision is made for Trust expenses then anticipated. 

 The Trust does not engage in
any business or extractive operations of any kind in the areas over
which it holds royalty rights and is precluded from engaging in such
activities by the Trust Agreement. There are no requirements,
therefore, for capital resources with which to make capital
expenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt of
royalty revenues by the Trust. 

 The properties of the Trust
are described in Item 2. Properties of this Report. Of particular
importance with respect to royalty income are the two royalty
agreements, the Mobil Agreement and the OEG Agreement. The Mobil
Agreement covers gas sales from the western part of the Oldenburg
concession. The Trust has traditionally received the majority of its
royalty income under the Mobil Agreement due to the higher
royalty rate of 4 . The OEG Agreement covers gas sales from
the entire Oldenburg concession but the royalty rate of 0.6667 is
significantly lower and gas royalties have been correspondingly
lower. 

 The operating companies pay
royalties to the Trust based on their sales of natural gas,
sulfur and oil. Of these three products, natural gas provided
approximately 99 of the total royalties in fiscal 2023. The amount
of royalties paid to the Trust is primarily based on four factors:
the amount of gas sold, the price of that gas, the area from which
the gas is produced and the exchange rate. For purposes of the royalty
calculations, the determination of the gas price is explained in
detail in the following three paragraphs. 

 On August 26, 2016, the
Mobil and OEG Agreements were amended to establish a new base to
determine gas prices for the calculation of the Trust's royalties.
This new base is set as the state assessment base for natural gas
used by the operating companies in their calculation of royalties
payable to the State of Lower Saxony. This change reflects a shift
to the prices calculated for the German Border Import gas Price
("GBIP"). The average combined totals of the GBIP for the relevant
three-month period are used to provide an average gas price for the
quarter. This average gas price is increased by 1 and 3 per the
terms of the Mobil and OEG Royalty Agreements and is used by the
operators to calculate the royalties payable to the Trust for a
given quarter. 

 The change to the GBIP has
reduced the scope and cost of the accounting examination, eliminated
ongoing disputes with OEG and Mobil regarding sales to related
parties, and reduced prior year adjustments to the normally
scheduled year-end reconciliation. The pricing basis has also
eliminated certain costs that were previously deductible prior to
the royalty calculation under the OEG Agreement. 

 On approximately the 25th
of the months of January, April, July and October, the operating
companies calculate the volume of gas sold during the previous
calendar quarter. This volume of gas sold is then multiplied by
the average adjusted GBIP available at that time. The respective
royalty amount is divided into thirds and forms the monthly royalty
payments to the Trust for the Trust's upcoming fiscal quarter. When
the operating companies determine the actual amount of royalties that
were payable for the prior calendar quarter, they also look at the
actual amount of royalties that were paid to the Trust for that
period and calculate the difference between what was paid and what
was payable. Positive adjustments are paid immediately and any
negative adjustments are deducted from the next royalty payment.
In September of the succeeding calendar year, the operating
companies make the final determination of any necessary royalty
adjustments for the prior calendar year with a positive or negative
adjustment made accordingly. 

 For unit owners, changes in
the U.S. dollar value of the Euro have an immediate impact. This
impact occurs at the time the royalties, which are paid to the
Trust in Euros, are converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable
exchange rate and transferred from Germany to the Trust's bank
account in the U.S. In relation to the U.S. dollar, a
stronger Euro would yield more U.S. dollars and a weaker Euro would
yield fewer U.S. dollars. 

 Seasonal demand factors
affect the income from the Trust's royalty rights insofar as they
relate to energy demands and increases or decreases in prices, but
on average they are generally not material to the annual income
received under the Trust's royalty rights. 

 The Trust has no means of
ensuring continued income from overriding royalty rights at their
present level or otherwise. The assets of the Trust are depleting
assets and, if the operators developing the concession do not perform
additional development projects, the assets may deplete faster than
expected. Eventually, the assets of the Trust will cease to produce
in commercial quantities and the Trust will cease to receive proceeds
from such assets. 

 The Trust's consultant in
Germany provides general information to the Trust on the German and
European economies and energy markets as well as monitoring the
continuing impact of the war in Ukraine and ongoing efforts by the
European governments to respond to the economic impacts of the war.
This information provides a context in which to evaluate the actions
of the operating companies. The Trust's consultant receives reports
from EMPG with respect to current and planned drilling and exploration
efforts. However, EMPG and the operating companies continue to limit
the information flow to that which is required by German law, and the
Trust is not able to confirm the accuracy of any of the information
supplied by EMPG or the operating companies. 

 The low level of
administrative expenses of the Trust limits the effect of inflation on
costs. Sustained price inflation would be reflected in sales prices.
Sales prices along with sales volumes form the basis on which the
royalties paid to the Trust are computed. 

 Results: Fiscal 2023 versus Fiscal
2022 

 Russia's current war against
Ukraine derailed the European energy system, with Germany hit
particularly hard. With Russian gas making up such a large portion of
Germany's energy needs, Germany took steps to rebuild its reserves for
the following winter and ensure a steady source of future supply. As
a result of the increase in demand for alternative sources of gas, in
August 2022 the GBIP spiked 645 year over year. These high gas
prices resulted in the destruction of some industrial demand and a
general reduction in consumer demand. However, the increase in gas
prices was short lived and following a warm winter with further
reduced demand, the GBIP continued to decline through the end of the
year. 

 Beginning at the end of the
second quarter of fiscal 2023, large negative adjustments dictated by
the Trust's royalty agreements were accrued and
subsequently applied against royalty income in the following quarter.
The ongoing price decline in conjunction with the accrued negative
adjustments continued to occur in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal
2023. The distribution of 0.21 per unit in the third quarter of
fiscal 2023 represented an 80 decline from the second quarter's
distribution of 1.05 per unit. There was no distribution for the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. 

 For fiscal 2023, the Trust's
gross royalty income increased 23.7 to 22,016,103 from 17,800,119
in fiscal 2022. The total distribution for fiscal 2023 was 2.26 per
unit compared to 1.83 per unit for fiscal 2022. Gas prices under
both royalty agreements were higher while gas sales and average
exchange rates were down. The royalty income received under the
Mobil Agreement in fiscal 2023 increased by 2,664,909 as compared to
fiscal 2022. Royalty income received under the OEG Agreement in
fiscal 2023 increased by 1,549,381 as compared to fiscal 2022. 

 The Trust receives
adjustments from the operating companies based on their final
calculations of royalties payable during the previous periods.
During fiscal 2023, the adjustments based on royalties payable for
2022 would have decreased royalty income by Euros 228,631. However,
because there was no royalty income received to offset, this negative
amount will carry over into the first quarter of fiscal 2024. During
fiscal 2022, the adjustments based on royalties payable for 2021
increased royalty income by 1,550,020. In fiscal 2023 and 2022,
Mobil sulfur royalties totaled 34,586 and 316,527, respectively. 

 Gas sales under the Mobil
Agreement decreased 16.4 to 12.439 Billion cubic feet ("Bcf") in
fiscal 2023 from 14.874 Bcf in fiscal 2022. Given the lack of drilling
by the operating companies during 2023 and the renovation work on
Grossenkneten, the Trust's consultant in Germany believes the decline
in gas production is due to the combination of the temporary shutdown
of processing at Grossenkneten and the normal reduction in well pressure
that is experienced over time.

 1. No royalty income was deposited into the Trust's account at
Deutsche Bank, and there was no conversion and transfer to the Trust's account
with M&T Bank. Consequently, no exchange rate was generated. 

Excluding the effects of
differences in prices and average exchange rates, the combination of
royalty rates on gas sold from western Oldenburg results in an effective
royalty rate approximately seven times higher than the royalty rate on
gas sold from eastern Oldenburg. This is of particular significance to
the Trust since gas sold from western Oldenburg provides the bulk of
royalties paid to the Trust. For fiscal 2023, the volume of gas sold from
western Oldenburg accounted for only 27.7 of the volume of all gas sales.
However, western Oldenburg gas royalties provided approximately 73.8 or
 16,041,589 out of a total of 21,740,519 in overall Oldenburg gas royalties. 

 Gas sales under the OEG Agreement
decreased 15.8 to 44.944 Bcf in fiscal 2023 from 53.385 Bcf in fiscal
2022. Given the lack of drilling by the operating companies during 2023
and the maintenance work on Grossenkneten, the Trust's consultant in Germany
believes the decline in gas production is due to the combination of the
temporary shutdown of processing at Grossenkneten and the normal reduction
in well pressure that is experienced over time.

 Report on Drilling and Geophysical Work 

 The Trust's German consultant
periodically contacts the representatives of the operating companies to
inquire about their planned and proposed drilling and geophysical work
and other general matters. The following represents a summary of the
most recent information the Trust's German consultant received from
representatives of EMPG in December 2023. The Trust is not able to
confirm the accuracy of any of the information supplied by the
operating companies. In addition, the operating companies are not
required to take any of the actions outlined and, if they change their
plans with respect to any such actions, they are not obligated to
inform the Trust. 

The Trust's German consultant has advised the Trust
that EMPG has not planned any new wells for calendar 2024 and no major
work has been initiated on the exploration side. 

 Maintenance work, including well cleanup jobs and foam
jobs to de-water weak wells, will be continuing to ensure the wells are
operating at maximum efficiency and production levels. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

 The financial statements,
appearing subsequently in this Report, present financial statement
balances and financial results on a modified cash basis of accounting,
which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP basis").
Cash basis accounting is an accepted accounting method for royalty
trusts such as the Trust. GAAP basis financial statements disclose
income as earned and expenses as incurred, without regard to receipts
or payments. The use of GAAP would require the Trust to accrue for
expected royalty payments. This is exceedingly difficult since the
Trust has very limited information on such payments until they are
received and cannot accurately project such amounts. The Trust's
cash basis financial statements disclose revenue when cash is
received and expenses when cash is paid. The one modification of
the cash basis of accounting is that the Trust accrues for
distributions to be paid to unit owners (those distributions
approved by the Trustees for the Trust). The Trust's distributable
income represents royalty income received by the Trust during the
period plus interest income less any expenses incurred by the Trust,
all on a cash basis. In the opinion of the Trustees, the use of the
modified cash basis provides a more meaningful presentation to unit
owners of the results of operations of the Trust and presents to the
unit owners a more accurate calculation of income and expenses for
tax reporting purposes. 

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

 The Trust has no off-balance
sheet arrangements. 

This Report on Form 10-K may
contain forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe
harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical
fact are forward-looking. Such statements address future expectations
and events or conditions concerning the Trust. You can identify many
forward-looking statements by words such as "may," "will," "would,"
"should," "could," "expects," "aim," "anticipates," "believes,"
"estimates," "intends," "plan," "predict," "project," "seek,"
"potential," "opportunities" and other similar expressions and the
negatives of such expressions. However, not all forward-looking
statements contain these words. Many of these statements are based on
information provided to the Trust by the operating companies or by
consultants using public information sources. These statements are
subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those anticipated in any
forward-looking statements. These include: 

 the fact that the assets
of the Trust are depleting assets and, if the operators developing the
concession do not perform additional development projects, the assets
may deplete faster than expected; 

 risks and uncertainties
concerning levels of gas production and gas sale prices, general
economic conditions and currency exchange rates; 

 the ability or willingness of the
operating companies to perform under their contractual
obligations with the Trust; 

 potential disputes with the
operating companies and the resolution thereof; and 

 political and economic
uncertainty arising from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

All such factors are difficult
to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual
results, and are generally beyond the control of the Trust. New
factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for the Trust
to predict all such factors or to assess the impact of each such factor
on the Trust. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date
on which such statement is made, and the Trust does not undertake any
obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or
circumstances after the date on which such statement is made. 

Item 7A. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk . 

 The Trust does not engage in
any trading activities with respect to possible foreign exchange
fluctuations. The Trust does not use any financial instruments to
hedge against possible risks related to foreign exchange
fluctuations. The market risk with respect to funds held in the
Trust's bank account in Germany is negligible because standing
instructions at the Trust's German bank require the bank to process
conversions and transfers of royalty payments as soon as possible
following their receipt. The Trust does not engage in any trading
activities with respect to commodity price fluctuations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

 To the Board of Trustees and the Unit Owners of 
North European Oil Royalty Trust 

 Opinion on the Financial
Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying statements of assets,
liabilities and trust corpus of North European Oil Royalty Trust (the
"Trust") as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related statements of
revenue collected and expenses paid, undistributed earnings, and changes in
cash and cash equivalents for each of the two years in the period ended
October 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
"financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities and trust corpus
of the Trust as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, and its revenue collected and
expenses paid, undistributed earnings and changes in its cash and cash
equivalents for each of the two years in the period ended October 31, 2023,
in conformity with the modified cash basis of accounting described in
Note 1. 

 Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust's
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Trust is not required to have,
nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall

NORTH EUROPEAN OIL
ROYALTY TRUST 

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 

 OCTOBER 31, 2023 AND 2022 

(1) Summary of significant accounting
policies: 

 Basis of accounting
- 

 The accompanying financial
statements of North European Oil Royalty Trust (the "Trust") are prepared
in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Financial
statement balances and financial results are presented on a modified
cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting
other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States ("GAAP basis"). In the opinion of management, all adjustments
that are considered necessary for a fair presentation of these
financial statements, including adjustments of a normal, recurring
nature, have been included. 

 On a modified cash basis,
revenue is earned when cash is received and expenses are incurred when
cash is paid. GAAP basis financial statements disclose revenue as
earned and expenses as incurred, without regard to receipts or
payments. The modified cash basis of accounting is utilized to permit
the accrual for distributions to be paid to unit owners (those
distributions approved by the Trustees for the Trust).
The Trust's distributable income represents royalty income received by
the Trust during the period plus interest income less any expenses
incurred by the Trust, all on a cash basis. In the opinion of the
Trustees, the use of the modified cash basis of accounting provides a
more meaningful presentation to unit owners of the results of
operations of the Trust. 

 The Trust receives
adjustments from the operating companies based on their final
calculations of royalties payable during the prior periods, including
the immediately preceding calendar quarter. Negative adjustments are
carried over to the succeeding quarter. 

 Producing gas and oil
royalty rights - 

 The rights to certain gas
and oil royalties in Germany were transferred to the Trust at their
net book value by North European Oil Company (the "Company") (see
Note 2). The net book value of the royalty rights has been reduced to
one dollar 1) since the remaining net book value
of royalty rights is de minimis relative to annual royalties received
and distributed by the Trust and does not bear any meaningful
relationship to the fair value of such rights or the actual amount of
proved producing reserves. 

 Federal and state
income taxes - 

 The Trust, as a grantor trust
and additionally under a private letter ruling issued by the Internal
Revenue Service, is exempt from federal income taxes. The Trust has no
state income tax obligations. 

 F-7 

 Cash and cash equivalents -

Cash and cash equivalents are
defined as amounts deposited in bank accounts and amounts invested in
certificates of deposit and U. S. Treasury bills with original
maturities generally of three months or less from the date of purchase.
The investment options available to the Trust are limited in accordance
with specific provisions of the Trust Agreement. As of October 31, 2023,
the uninsured amounts held in the Trust's U.S. bank accounts were
 538,163. In addition, the Trust held Euros 6,659, the equivalent of
 7,038, in its German bank account at October 31, 2023. 

 Net income per unit - 

 	Net income per unit is based
upon the number of units outstanding at the end of the period. As of
October 31, 2023 and 2022, there were 9,190,590 units of beneficial
interest outstanding. 

 New accounting
pronouncements - 

 The Trust is not aware of
any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards that
would be expected to have a significant impact on the Trust's
financial position or results of operations. 

(2) Formation of the Trust: 

 The Trust was formed on
September 10, 1975. As of September 30, 1975, the Company was
liquidated and the remaining assets and liabilities of the Company,
including its royalty rights, were transferred to the Trust. The
Trust, on behalf of the owners of beneficial interest in the Trust,
holds overriding royalty rights covering gas and oil production in
certain concessions or leases in the Federal Republic of Germany.
These rights are held under contracts with local German exploration
and development subsidiaries of ExxonMobil Corp. and the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group of Companies. Under these contracts, the Trust
receives various percentage royalties on the proceeds of the sales of
certain products from the areas involved. At the present time,
royalties are received for sales of gas well gas, oil well gas,
crude oil, condensate and sulfur. 

 (3) Related party transactions: 

 John R. Van Kirk, the
Managing Director of the Trust, provides office services to the Trust
at cost. For such office services, the Trust reimbursed the Managing
Director 10,524 and 5,256 in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

(4) Employee benefit plan: 

 The Trust has established a
savings incentive match plan for employees (SIMPLE IRA) that is
available to both employees of the Trust, one of whom is the Managing
Director. The Trustees authorized the making of contributions by the
Trust to the accounts of employees, on a matching basis,
of up to 3 of cash compensation paid to each such employee for
the 2023 and 2022 calendar years.

 1. At the end
of each fiscal quarter, the Trust
converts the Euro balance in its account at Deutsche Bank into
dollars and includes this amount in the royalty income total.
Since there was no royalty income for the fourth fiscal quarter
and there was a loss on exchange, the total royalty income for
the fourth fiscal quarter is a negative number. 

2. The negative net income is comprised of the
negative royalty income minus the quarterly expenses plus interest
income.

 Item 9. Changes in and

 None. 

Item 9A. Controls
and Procedures. 

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 The Trust maintains disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Trust is recorded, processed,
summarized, accumulated and communicated to its management, which
consists of the Managing Director, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure, and reported within the time periods specified in
the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. The Managing
Director has performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures as of
October 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, the Managing Director
concluded that the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of October 31, 2023. 

 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

 Part A. Management's
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

 The Trust's management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(f)) for the Trust. There are inherent limitations in the
effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of
human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls.
Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.
Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of
internal control may vary over time. Management has evaluated the
Trust's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31,
2023. This assessment was based on criteria for effective
internal control over financial reporting described in the standards
promulgated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and in
the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the
Trust's internal control over financial reporting was effective as
of October 31, 2023. 

Part B. Attestation
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

 Not applicable 

 Part C. Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

 There have been no changes in
the Trust's internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust's internal
control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 4.1 

 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES 

 The following is a summary of
information concerning units of beneficial interest of North European Oil
Royalty Trust (the " Trust "). The summaries and
descriptions below do not purport to be complete statements of the
relevant provisions of the Trust Agreement (" Trust
Agreement ") dated as of September 10, 1975 (as last
amended on February 13, 2008) or the Amended and Restated Trustees'
Regulations, dated as of October 31, 2007 (the " Regulations
 "), and are entirely qualified by these documents. 

 Units . The
Trust's units of beneficial interest (the " Units ") are
registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol
"NRT." The issued and outstanding Units are fully paid and
non-assessable. This means the full purchase price for the outstanding
Units have been paid and the owners of such Units will not be assessed
any additional amounts for such Units. 

 Distributions and
Reserves . The Trustees will, not less than quarterly,
distribute and pay to the unit owners, in proportion to their respective
beneficial interest of the Units, all rents, royalties, income, proceeds
and other receipt of or from the properties held by the Trustees
(" Trust Estate "), after payment of, or provision for,
the expenses, liabilities and obligations of the Trust Estate. The
Trustees have the right to determine from time to time the amounts to be
retained as reserves in connection with anticipated charges or expenses of
the Trust, for contingent or unascertained liabilities or obligations of
the Trust, or for such other purpose as the Trustees may determine. 

 Voting Rights . 
Each Unit is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of
unit owners. Neither the Trust Agreement nor the Regulations provide for
cumulative voting in the election of the Trustees. 

 Other Rights . 
The Units are not subject to redemption by operation of a sinking fund or
otherwise. Unit owners are not currently entitled to preemptive rights.

and 15d 15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f)) for the
registrant and have: 

 Designed such disclosure controls and procedures,
or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
my supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
me by others within those entities, particularly during the period
in which this report is being prepared; and

Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or

reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with the modified cash
basis of accounting; and

Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures and presented in this report my conclusions
about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as

 Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the
registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal
quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
control over financial reporting; and 

 I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal
control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and to
the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons

 All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information; and 

 Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 97 

 NORTH EUROPEAN OIL ROYALTY TRUST 

POLICY FOR THE 
RECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY AWARDED COMPENSATION 

OVERVIEW 

 In accordance with the applicable rules of The
New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual (the "NYSE
Rules" ), Section 10D and Rule 10D-1 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act" "Rule 10D-1" , the Board of
Trustees (the "Board" of North European Oil
Royalty Trust (the "Trust") has adopted this Policy (the
 "Policy" to provide for the
recovery of erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation from
Executive Officers. All capitalized terms used and not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in Section H,
below. 

RECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY
AWARDED COMPENSATION 

 1. Although
the Trust does not, as a general rule, employ Incentive-based
Compensation, this Policy shall govern all instances where, in
fact, the Trust did utilize Incentive-based Compensation. In
the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Trust will reasonably
promptly recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received in
accordance with NYSE Rules and Rule 10D-1 as follows: 

 (i) After an Accounting Restatement, the
Compensation Committee (if composed entirely of independent Trustees,
or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of independent
Trustees serving on the Board) (the "Committee" 
shall determine the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation
Received by each Executive Officer and shall promptly notify each
Executive Officer with a written notice containing the amount of any
Erroneously Awarded Compensation and a demand for repayment or
return of such compensation, as applicable. 

(a) For Incentive-based Compensation
based on (or derived from) the Trust's stock price or total
shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded
Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly
from the information in the applicable Accounting Restatement: 

i. The amount to be repaid or returned shall be
determined by the Committee based on a reasonable estimate of the
effect of the Accounting Restatement on the Trust's stock price or
total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-based Compensation
was Received; and 

ii. The Trust shall maintain documentation of the
determination of such reasonable estimate and provide the relevant
documentation as required to the NYSE. 

(ii) 
The Committee shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means
of recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on the particular
facts and circumstances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set
forth in Section B (2) below, in no event may the Trust accept an
amount that is less than the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation
in satisfaction of an Executive Officer's obligations hereunder. 

(iii) To the extent that the
Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Trust for any Erroneously
Awarded Compensation Received under any duplicative recovery obligations
established by the Trust or applicable law, it shall be appropriate for
any such reimbursed amount to be credited to the amount of Erroneously
Awarded Compensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy. 

(iv) To the extent that an
Executive Officer fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation to
the Trust when due, the Trust shall take all actions reasonable and
appropriate to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the
applicable Executive Officer. The applicable Executive Officer shall be
required to reimburse the Trust for any and all expenses reasonably
incurred (including legal fees) by the Trust in recovering such
Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence. 

2. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Trust shall not be required to take the
actions contemplated by Section B (1) above if the Committee (which,
as specified above, is composed entirely of independent Trustees or
in the absence of such a committee, a majority of the independent
Trustees serving on the Board) determines that recovery would be
impracticable and any of the following two conditions are met: 

(i.) The Committee has determined
that the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing
the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before making this
determination, the Trust must make a reasonable attempt to recover the
 Erroneously Awarded Compensation, documented such attempt(s) and
 provided such documentation to the NYSE; or 

(ii.) Recovery would likely cause
an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are
broadly available to employees of the Trust, to fail to meet the
requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations thereunder. 

C. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS 

 The Trust shall file all disclosures with respect
to this Policy required by applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission "SEC" filings and rules. 

D. PROHIBITION OF INDEMNIFICATION 

 The Trust shall not be permitted to insure or
indemnify any Executive Officer against (i) the loss of any Erroneously
Awarded Compensation that is repaid, returned or recovered pursuant to the
terms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating to the Trust's
enforcement of its rights under this Policy. Further, the Trust shall not
enter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive-based Compensation that
is granted, paid or awarded to an Executive Officer from the application of
this Policy or that waives the Trust's right to recovery of any Erroneously
Awarded Compensation, and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement
(whether entered into before, on or after the Effective Date of this Policy).

E. ADMINISTRATION AND INTERPRETATION 

 This Policy shall be administered by the
Committee, and any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and
binding on all affected individuals. 

 The Committee is authorized to interpret and
construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate,
or advisable for the administration of this Policy and for the Trust's
compliance with NYSE Rules, Section 10D, Rule 10D-1 and any other applicable
law, regulation, rule or interpretation of the SEC or NYSE promulgated or
issued in connection therewith. 

F. AMENDMENT; TERMINATION 

 The Committee may amend this Policy from time
to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section F to the contrary, no amendment or
termination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination
would (after taking into account any actions taken by the Trust
contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Trust to
violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule or NYSE rule. 

G. OTHER RECOVERY RIGHTS 

 This Policy shall be binding and enforceable
against all Executive Officers and, to the extent required by applicable law
or guidance from the SEC or NYSE, their beneficiaries, heirs, executors,
administrators or other legal representatives. The Committee intends that
this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent required by applicable law.
Any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan or any
other agreement or arrangement with an Executive Officer shall be deemed to
include, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, an agreement
by the Executive Officer to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of
recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Trust under
applicable law, regulation or rule or pursuant to the terms of any policy of
the Trust or any provision in any employment agreement, equity award agreement,
compensatory plan, agreement or other arrangement.

Calculation of the Cost Depletion Percentage 
For the Calendar Year 2023 

 Trustees: 

 In accordance with the request of the Trustees of
North European Oil Royalty Trust (the "Trust"), Graves & Co.
Consulting LLC of Houston, Texas has performed the calculations
necessary to derive the cost depletion percentage for the 2023
calendar year. The cost depletion percentage was prepared for use
by unit owners of the Trust in filing federal income tax returns.
In order to calculate the cost depletion percentage, we prepared a
report of the estimated remaining proved producing reserves
attributable to the overriding royalty interests of the Trust in
the Northwest German Basin of the Federal Republic of Germany with
an effective date of October 1, 2023. 

 We have reviewed all available information with
respect to 100 of the Trust's proved developed properties used in
the calculation of the cost depletion percentage as discussed later
in this report. It is our opinion that these properties represent
all of the Trust's assets that may be classified as proved for this
purpose as per the Securities and Exchange Commission directives
detailed later in this report. 

 The reserves associated with this review have been
classified in accordance with the definitions of the Securities and
Exchange Commission as found in Part 210-Form and Content of and
Requirements for Financial Statements, Securities Act of 1933,
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935, Investment Company Act of 1940, Investment Advisers Act of
1940, and Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, under Rules of
General Application Section 210.4-10 financial accounting and
reporting for oil and gas producing activities pursuant to the
Federal securities laws and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act
of 1975. 

 The proved producing reserves are as of October 1,
2023 and the reported sales are for the twelve-month period ending
September 30, 2023. The use of the period ending September 30, 2023
is consistent with prior years and allows the timely calculation of
the royalty reserves and the cost depletion percentage for the
calendar year. Throughout this report the unit price used for crude
oil, condensate, natural gas and sulfur is based upon the prices in
effect at the time of the royalty calculations. The price for each
of the products is then averaged for the twelve-month period to arrive
at the unit price. 

 Based on the results of our calculation of estimated
remaining proved producing reserves contained in the first part of this
report, we have performed the calculations necessary to derive the cost
depletion percentage for the 2023 calendar year. As detailed in
Attachment B, the cost depletion percentage for the 2023 calendar
year for Trust unit owners is equal to 8.8130 of the unit owner's
cost basis as of January 1, 2023. 

 Discussion 

 The scope of this study was to review limited
information we were able to compile and to prepare an estimate of the
proved producing reserves subject to the Trust's royalty interests from
which the cost depletion percentage could be calculated. We prepared
reserve estimates using acceptable evaluation principles for each source.
These estimates were based in large part on the limited information
supplied by the operator of the relevant properties. 

 The quantities presented herein are estimated reserves
of oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and sulfur that geologic and
engineering data demonstrate can be recovered from known reservoirs under
current economic conditions with reasonable certainty. 

 Description of Holdings 

 The Trust holds various overriding royalty rights on
sales of gas, sulfur and oil from certain concessions and leases in
the Federal Republic of Germany. The Oldenburg concession
(1,386,000 acres), located in the federal state of Lower Saxony, is
held by Oldenburgische Erdolgesellschaft ("OEG"). OEG in turn is owned
by Mobil Erdgas-Erdol GmbH ("Mobil Erdgas"), the German subsidiary of
ExxonMobil Corp. and by BEB Erdgas und Erdol GmbH ("BEB"), a joint
venture of ExxonMobil Corp. and the Royal Dutch Shell Group of Companies.
As a result, by direct and indirect ownership, ExxonMobil Corp. owns
two-thirds of OEG and the Royal Dutch Shell Group owns one-third of
OEG. 

 In 2002 Mobil Erdgas and BEB formed a new company
ExxonMobil Production Deutschland GmbH to carry out all exploration,
drilling and production within the Oldenburg concession. All sales
activities are still handled by either Mobil Erdgas or BEB. 

 The Oldenburg concession is currently the primary
source of royalty income for the Trust. All proved producing
reserves within the Oldenburg concession are covered by this report.
Although the Trust has royalty interests in other areas, these areas
are no longer used in the calculation of the annual cost depletion
percentage because there is minimal current production from these
areas. 

 The Trust's rights in the Oldenburg concession are
described as follows: 

 Under one set of rights covering the western part
of the Oldenburg concession (approximately 662,000 acres), the Trust
receives a royalty payment of 4 on gross receipts from sales by
Mobil Erdgas of gas well gas, oil well gas, crude oil and condensate
("Mobil Agreement"). Under the Mobil Agreement there is no deduction
of costs prior to the calculation of royalties from gas well gas or
oil well gas, which together account for over 99 of all
the royalties under said agreement. 

Under another series of rights covering the entire Oldenburg
concession and pursuant to an agreement with OEG, the Trust receives
royalties at the rate of 0.6667 on gross receipts from sales of gas
well gas, oil well gas, crude oil, condensate and sulfur (removed
during the processing of sour gas) less a certain allowed deduction
of costs ("OEG Agreement"). 

Under the OEG Agreement, 50 of the field handling and treatment costs
as reported for state royalty purposes are deducted from gross sales
receipts prior to the calculation of the royalty to be paid to the
Trust. Sulfur is a by-product of gas production and is not considered
in the computation of total cost depletion. 

The Trust is also entitled to receive from Mobil Erdgas, a 2 
royalty payment on gross receipts from sales of sulfur obtained as a
by-product of sour gas produced from the western part of Oldenburg.
However, the payment of the sulfur royalty is provisional on whether
Mobil Erdgas' selling price meets or exceeds the indexed base price.
Sulfur is a by-product of gas production and is not considered in the
computation of total cost depletion. 

 Oldenburg
Area - Sales and Reserves 

 The Trust's royalty income currently comes
exclusively from the Oldenburg area. Gas production accounts for
the majority of the income; however, the hydrogen sulfide in much of
the gas produced necessitates its removal before the gas can be sold.
At the Grossenkneten desulfurization plant, the hydrogen sulfide in
sour gas is removed. The plant's present input capacity stands at
approximately 200 million cubic feet ("MMcf") per day following
ExxonMobil's retirement of Unit 3 in April 2017, and more recently by
the retirement of Unit 2 in June 2023. The elimination of two of the
plant's three trains has effectively reduced the input capacity by
two-thirds. 

 Total Sales 

 During the twelve months ending September 30, 2023,
total sales for the Oldenburg area were as follows: 
 
 Total Sales 
 West 
 East 
 Total 

Gas Well Gas - MMCF 
 12,439.6

Gross Reserves 

Estimated gross remaining proved producing reserves
attributable to the total Oldenburg area as of October 1, 2023 are
as follows: 

Gross Reserves

 Sulfur - Short Tons 
 631,448.4 
 2,228,154.5 
 2,859,602.9 

Gross reserves are down across the board based on a
combination of gas production constraints, lower oil prices, and higher
operating expenses which shorten the economic life. The exception is
western oil production, which has seen improved production rates and
lower operating expenses. 

Net Reserves and Sales 

 To present an accurate picture of estimated proved
producing reserves net to the Trust, the gross reserve figures
outlined above must be modified by the impact of the different
royalty rates in effect in the Oldenburg concession. A comparison of
the Trust's overriding royalty rates in both the western and eastern
areas of Oldenburg is as follows: 

Royalty Source 
 West 
 East 

 Mobil Erdgas Gas & Oil 
 4 
 0 

 Mobil Erdgas Sulfur 
 2 
 0 

BEB Gas & Oil 
 0.6667 (1) 
 0.6667 (1) 

BEB Sulfur 
 0.6667 (1) 
 0.6667 (1) 

(1) Prior to the
calculation of royalties, 50 of costs as reported for 
state royalty purposes are deducted. 

The application of these royalty rates to the estimated
gross remaining proved producing reserves attributable to the western
and eastern Oldenburg areas yields the combined estimated proved
producing reserves net to the Trust. The Trust's estimated remaining
net proved producing reserves as of October 1, 2023 and net sales for
the twelve month period ending September 30, 2023 are as follows: 

Net Reserves & Sales 
 Reserves 
 Sales 

 Gas Well Gas - MMCF 
 7,828.4 
 759.0 

 Oil Well Gas - MMCF 
 0.5

Oil & Condensate - Barrels 
 32,798.1 
 2,709.3 

Sulfur - Short Tons 
 29,824.4 
 2,722.0 

A summary of net proved producing reserves by product
and a five-year history of net sales attributable to the royalty
interests of the Trust are presented in Attachment A. Net gas well gas
and sulfur reserves are down compared to 2022 because of gas processing
plant refurbishment and resulting production constraints. Net oil
reserves are up based on performance at Lastrup-West. Though not
material, net oil well gas sales decreased sharply in 2023 resulting in
a corresponding drop in net reserves. 

 Limitations of Available
Data 

 The reserves considered in this report are defined as
proved producing reserves. Proved producing reserves are limited to
those quantities which can be expected to be recoverable commercially
from known reservoirs at current prices and costs, under existing
regulatory practices and with existing conventional equipment and
operating methods. Proved producing reserves do not include either
proved developed non producing reserves or any class of probable
reserves. 

 The estimate of reserves included in this report is
based primarily upon production history or analogy with wells in the
area producing from the same or similar formations. Typically,
geological data, well reports, and well tests are available and
utilized in evaluations; however, no such data was made available
for 2023. 

 The reserves included in this report are estimates
only and should not be construed as being exact quantities. The
accuracy of the estimates is dependent upon the quality of available
data and upon the independent geological and engineering interpretation
of that data. The quantities presented herein are estimated reserves
of hydrocarbons and produced products that geologic and engineering
data demonstrate can be recovered from known reservoirs under current
economic conditions with reasonable certainty. Reserve estimates
presented in this report are calculated using acceptable methods and
procedures and are believed to be appropriate and reasonable; however,
future reservoir performance may justify revision of these
estimates. 

 For the purpose of this report, estimated reserves are
scheduled for recovery primarily on the basis of actual producing rates
or appropriate well test information. They were prepared giving
consideration to engineering and geological data, anticipated producing
mechanisms, the number and types of completions, as well as past
performance of analogous reservoirs. Individual well production
histories, when available, were analyzed and an appropriate daily
producing rate was utilized for each individual well in the
preparation of a forecast of future producing rates until an
anticipated economic limit. 

 No information was received from the operator
concerning activity in the field during the Trust's fiscal year 2023 other
than there was no drilling activity, and five wells were plugged and
abandoned. 

 The estimates of reserves and the forecasted rates of
production may be subject to regulation by various agencies, changes in
market demand or other factors. Consequently, the volumes of reserves
recovered, and the actual rates of recovery, may vary from the estimates
included herein. 

 The Trust, as an overriding royalty interest owner,
does not receive proprietary data from the various operators on
producing wells. Data, such as logs, core analysis, reservoir tests,
pressure tests, gas analyses, geologic maps, and individual well
production histories on all of the wells which are used in volumetric
and material balance type reserve estimates, are not available to the
Trust. The lack of such data increases the inherent uncertainties of
our reserve estimate. 

 The Trust receives quarterly statements from the
operators that report production, sales and revenue data. Utilizing the
same procedures as in prior years, this information has
been used to prepare this annual report. In addition, the Trust retains
a part-time consultant in Germany who is familiar with the German
petroleum industry in general and the operating companies in particular.
His periodic reports and communications were considered in the
preparation of this report. 

 Overview of Natural Gas
Processing 

 ExxonMobil operates a natural gas processing plant,
the Grossenkneten Plant at Grossenkneten, Lower Saxony, Germany,
located approximately 40 kilometers to the west of Bremen. The plant
is designed to remove non-hydrocarbon impurities from the natural gas
produced on the Oldenburg concession, especially hydrogen sulfide.
The Grossenkneten plant has supplied natural gas and sulfur to Germany
for over 50 years. Seventy-five percent (75 of the natural gas
produced on the Oldenburg concession is sour gas requiring
desulfurization at the plant. The following paragraphs provide a
description of the plant and changes in ExxonMobil's
operation of the plant that have impacted Trust royalty income this
year and that may have an impact on Trust royalty income in the
future. 

 Description of
Grossenkneten Plant 

 The Grossenkneten Plant consists of complex natural
gas desulfurization and dehydration, sulfur recovery ("Claus-process"),
waste gas purification and ancillary facilities. The ancillary
facilities include a steam boiler, a gas engine, emergency flaring
facilities and a condensing power station. 

 Every ten years, the plant is shut down for extensive
refurbishment and maintenance, including safety checks and efficiency
improvements. Given the hydrogen sulfide content of the natural gas,
safety requirements for working on the site are very stringent. The
most recent refurbishment occurred from August to October 2020, and
included 3,200 individual maintenance and installation activities.
The refurbishment employed 600 contractors, and the work injected 30
million euros into the local and regional economies. A new gas/gas
heat exchanger was installed, improving the plant's energy efficiency.
Following the refurbishment work, the plant was re-certified for
another ten years, until 2030. 

 Changes in
ExxonMobil's Plant Operations 

 The Grossenkneten Plant originally had three trains
in use desulfurizing and dehydrating natural gas. Each operating
train had a treatment capacity of approximately 2.0 billion cubic
meters per year of untreated sour gas. ExxonMobil retired Unit 3
in April 2017, effectively reducing the plant input capacity at that
time by one-third. Consistent with the inherent decline of Oldenburg
gas production, ExxonMobil shut down a second of the three trains
during the summer of 2023. As of June 2023, only one train remains
in use and throughput is understood to be at capacity. This
refurbishment and optimization work negatively impacted the production
from the wells between May and July. 

 Impacts on Future
Trust Royalty Income 

 The Trust's German consultant has informed us that
because of the changes in plant operations, production curtailment
estimated at 8.9 is expected until the end of the first quarter in
2024. Although this suggests a modest potential increase in production
starting in the second quarter of 2024, no concomitant adjustment has
been built into the production forecasts for the Trust's wells.
Requirements to periodically cycle off and on weak, low-pressure wells
and high water-cut wells, operations that are consistent with the
maturity of the field, are expected to offset any increase from ending
the curtailment. 

 ExxonMobil's shutdown of the second train at
Grossenkneten should result in a reduction of certain costs deducted
from the Trust's gross royalties. Offsetting these reductions will be
increased well operating expenses which are the inevitable result of
declining production volumes. 

 Uncertainties
Related to Future Gas Plant Operations 

 We possess insufficient data from the plant's operator,
ExxonMobil, that would be necessary to make a quantitative assessment
of the uncertainties related to the economics of future long-term
operations at the Grossenkneten Plant. Accordingly, Graves has decided
not to allocate a risk factor to the reserve calculations used in the
preparation of this report attributable to such uncertainties. Full
retirement of the Grossenkneten plant at some time in the future could
potentially mean the end of production from the Oldenburg concession
and of the Trust's royalty income. The producing life of the concession
and the oil, gas, and sulfur reserves attributable thereto that are set
forth in this report would in such an event be cut short. 

 Reserve Estimates 

 We believe that reserve estimates prepared using all
the available data are appropriate and sufficient for the calculation
of the cost depletion percentage. However, due to the limitations of
available data, this estimate of reserves cannot have the same degree
of accuracy that an estimate of reserves prepared using all pertinent
data would have. Our experience in the evaluation of reserves using
such limited data compensates somewhat for the limitations of available
data. 

 The data in the reports received by the Trust is in
metric tons and cubic meters. The following Metric to English Unit
conversion factors were used: 

Gas: 
 37.25 cubic feet per cubic meter at 14.7 psia and 60 degrees
Fahrenheit 

 Oil: 
 7.23 barrels per metric ton 

 Sulfur: 
 1.1 short tons per metric ton 

Calculation of Cost Depletion
Percentage 

 The categories of proved producing reserves considered
in the calculation of the cost depletion percentage are oil, oil well
gas, and gas well gas. Sulfur is a by-product of gas production and is
not considered in the computation of total cost depletion percentage. 

 For each category of reserves, a product base was
established for the Trust as of January 1, 1976. Through the use of
these product bases, we can account for the relative size of each of
these categories of reserves and the corresponding impact on the
calculation of the cost depletion percentage. The product base for each
category of proved producing reserves is reduced annually by an
adjustment that is calculated by multiplying the product base at the
beginning of the current year by the depletion factor for that category
of reserves. 

 The depletion factor for each category of reserves is
the ratio of the relevant net sales during the current year to the
corresponding adjusted net proved producing reserves at the beginning
of the current year. 

 Significant items in the cost depletion percentage
calculation that appear on Attachment B as specific item numbers, shown
in parentheses and their sources are as follows: 

The adjusted estimated net proved producing
reserves as of 10/1/2022 Line (3) is obtained by adding the estimated
remaining net proved producing reserves as of 10/1/2022 Line (1) and
the adjustments to reserves during the period Line (2). Therefore
Line (3) = Line (1) + Line (2). 

 The depletion factor Line (6) for each
category of proved producing reserves is obtained by dividing the
relevant net sales Line (4) by the corresponding adjusted estimated net
proved producing reserves as of 10/1/2022 Line (3). Therefore Line (6)
= Line (4) / Line (3). 

 The product base for each category of proved
producing reserves as of 1/1/2022 Line (7) and the adjustment taken
during 2022 Line (8) were obtained from the previous year's report.
The product base as of 1/1/2023 Line (9) forms the initial starting
point for the calculation of the cost depletion percentage for the
2023 tax year. The product base for 1/1/2023 Line (9) then is Line (7)
- Line (8). 

 The adjustment to the product base for each
category of proved producing reserves Line (10) is used to reduce the
product base as of the beginning of each year. This adjustment is the
product of the depletion factor for each category of proved producing
reserves Line (6) multiplied by the corresponding product base as of
1/1/2023 Line (9). Therefore Line (10) = Line (6) x Line (9). 

 The cost depletion percentage Line (11) then
is the sum of the adjustment to the product base of each category of
proved producing reserves [Sum Line (10)] divided by the sum of the
product base for each category as of 1/1/2023 [Sum Line (9)]. Therefore
Line (11) = [Sum Line (10)] / [Sum Line (9)]. 

The cost depletion percentage represents the total
allowable cost depletion for the 2023 calendar year for the Trust's unit
owners, expressed as a percentage of their cost base as of January 1,
2023.

 Rules of General Application 

 Section 210.4-10 Financial accounting and
reporting for oil and gas producing activities pursuant to the
Federal securities laws and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act
of 1975. 

 Reserves 

 Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and
gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible,
as of a given date, by application of development projects to known
accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a
reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce
or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering
oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and
financing required to implement the project. 

 Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs
isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs
are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should
not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known
accumulation by a non-productive reservoir i.e., absence of
reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results).
Such areas may contain prospective resources i.e., potentially
recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). 

 Proved Oil and Gas Reserves 

 Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil
and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be
estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible--from
a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic
conditions, operating methods, and government regulations--prior to the
time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless
evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of
whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the
estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced
or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the
project within a reasonable time. 

 The area of the reservoir considered as proved
includes: 
 The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid
contacts, if any, and 

 Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with
reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain
economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available
geoscience and engineering data. 

 In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a
reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in
a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data
and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable
certainty. 

 Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a
highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an
associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the
structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience,
engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the
higher contact with reasonable certainty. 

 Reserves which can be produced economically through application of
improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid
injection) are included in the proved classification when: 

 Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of
the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir
as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or
an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology
establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on
which the project or program was based; and 

 The project has been approved for development by all necessary
parties and entities, including governmental entities. 

 Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which
economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price
shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the
ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an
unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for
each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual
arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. 

Reasonable certainty. If deterministic
methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree of
confidence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic
methods are used, there should be at least a 90 probability that the
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. A
high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely
to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to increased availability
of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering,
and economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with
time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain
constant than to decrease. 

 Reliable technology. Reliable technology
is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational
methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to
provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability
in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. 

 Probable Reserves 

 Probable reserves are those additional reserves that
are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which,
together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. 

 When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely
as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum
of estimated proved plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods
are used, there should be at least a 50 probability that the actual
quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable
reserves estimates. 

 Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent
to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available
data are less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of
structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty
criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are
structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in
communication with the proved reservoir. 

 Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental
quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the
hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves. 

 Possible Reserves 

 Possible reserves are those additional reserves that
are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves. 

 When deterministic methods are used, the total
quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability
of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. When
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10 
probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal
or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates.

Possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent
to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of
available data are progressively less certain. Frequently, this will
be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define
clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the
reservoir by a defined project. 

 Possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated
with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than
the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves. 

 The proved plus probable and proved plus probable plus possible
reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical
and commercial interpretations within the reservoir or subject project
that are clearly documented, including comparisons to results in
successful similar projects. 

 Possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering
data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same
accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with
displacement less than formation thickness or other geological
discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore, and
the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in
communication with the known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may
be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the
proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved
reservoir. 

 Pursuant to paragraph (a)(22)(iii) of this section, where direct
observation has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the
potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves should
be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir above
the HKO only if the higher contact can be established with reasonable
certainty through reliable technology. Portions of the reservoir that
do not meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be assigned as
probable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid properties
and pressure gradient interpretations. 

 Developed Oil and Gas Reserves 

 Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any
category that can be expected to be recovered: 

 Through existing wells with existing equipment and
 operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is
relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and 

 Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure
operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is
by means not involving a well. 

 Undeveloped Oil and Gas Reserves 

 Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any
category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled
acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is
required for recompletion. 

 Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to
those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably
certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable
technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic
producibility at greater distances. 

 Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped
reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that
they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific
circumstances, justify a longer time. 

 Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be
attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection
or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such
techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same
reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of
this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology
establishing reasonable certainty. 

 Additional Definitions: 

 Deterministic Estimate 

 The method of estimating reserves or resources is called
deterministic when a single value for each parameter (from the
geoscience, engineering, or economic data) in the reserves calculation
is used in the reserves estimation procedure. 

 Probabilistic Estimate 

 The method of estimation of reserves or resources is
called probabilistic when the full range of values that could
reasonably occur for each unknown parameter (from the geoscience and
engineering data) is used to generate a full range of possible outcomes
and their associated probabilities of occurrence. 

 Reasonable Certainty 

 If deterministic methods are used, reasonable certainty
means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be
recovered. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least
a 90 probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or
exceed the estimate. A high degree of confidence exists if the quantity
is much more likely to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to
increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and
geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to estimated
ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more
likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.
