We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management s best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. Company History The Company was incorporated in Nevada on September 27, 1984 as Numeric Two Corporation. On July 10, 1985 we changed our name to Beta Tech Robotics, Inc. On August 28, 1996, we changed our name to Axion Spatial Imaging, Inc. On March 9, 2009, we changed our name to Alco Advanced Technologies, Inc. Finally, on April 5, 2012, we changed our name to Southern ITS International, Inc. Business Overview Southern ITS International, Inc. has successfully provided proprietary equipment and services to support government regulated high compliance industries . This success is measured by the facts that the equipment and systems installed operated according to contract specifications and the warranties for said installations were provided by and supported by SITS . Government sectors (correctional facilities and programs), and private sectors, including gaming and now medical marijuana and recreational marijuana (MMJ/MJ), have had challenges, but have been brought into the mainstream and are now subject to stringent compliance to tough government regulations. Southern ITS International, Inc. has historically developed and delivered to the gaming and corrections sectors high compliance support systems facilitating the integration and implementation of complementary technologies. SITS continues to deliver such electronic security and networking infrastructures to those clients. SITS is expanding to deliver the same quality of auditing and compliance technology to the emerging MMJ/MJ market sector that it delivers to other high compliance industries. Additionally SITS has and will continue developing new patent pending equipment and systems specifically addressing MMJ/MJ-related government and banking regulations and requirements. Specifically, addressing the FinCEN problems related to all cash businesses. Our market position in the Security Systems sector and in the MMJ Financial Security Systems sector is in the lower segment of service providers. We do not enjoy the position of a large service provider or a multi-state office system. We market to the industries through networking, telephone and print ads and Industry Conventions. We compete on the basis of pricing and flexibility of installation timing. G r ee niosk Secure Cash Payment System: Southern ITS International, Inc has created the first payment to sales technology for marijuana dispensaries called Greeniosk . The Greeniosk System provides a legal and easy solution to the Bank Depository problem. Greeniosk provides a detailed and complete transaction record from payment-to-sales which combined with Seeds-to-Sales software and hardware not only keeps the audit trail for the payment but also for the management of the inventory. 3 Table of Contents Greeniosk System uses a combination of hardware and software that produces a complete record keeping system and audit trail from the cash purchase of the client to the deposit at the bank. Each transaction is processed through a secure, safe-type kiosk that will accept all types and denominations of currency. The Greeniosk prints an encrypted bar code voucher that is redeemed at the dispensing counter to purchase the product. The kiosk operation is simple and only requires the client to answer 3 qualifying questions. The Greeniosk kiosk and system accomplishes several important tasks; it removes the handling of cash by employees, the cash remains in a safely locked kiosk and can only be removed by authorized people or money transport companies. When the currency is removed from the Greeniosk , or at the end of the day the Greeniosk will print an audit report of each deposit. The Greeniosk not only reports the total and detail amounts collected, but also produces a report of the denomination of each bill used for payment. If the bank requires further documentation, we can provide a digital image file of each bill inserted in the Greeniosk and match the currency transaction to the client s driver license and marijuana card. All this is loaded into the Greeniosk database for additional audit trail and reporting purposes. The vouchers redeemed by the clients at the dispensary counter for merchandise will be used to provide a paper audit trail process. One of the purposes of the FinCEN bulletin Guidance Clarification Expectations of Financial Instructions Serving Marijuana Business is to provide clarity and to enhance the availability of financial services for the marijuana business. The Greeniosk System will allow the Marijuana businesses to create the records and documentation needed for compliance, auditing and will build a trusted relationship between the Conventional Banks and the Marijuana business owners. Although we have filed for Trademark and Patent protection, there is no guarantee that we can continually preserve and protect our patent. We will continue with our research and development and try to ensure to keep our edge in the market, but there are no guarantees we will be successful. Our MMJ financial system solution does not need to be approved by any government agency and is not endorsed by any government agency. Our system is an effort to provide clients and banks with enough original transactional, auditable data to begin to meet the requirements of banking and cash transaction regulators. We are only targeting clients in those states where MMJ operations have already been legalized by the state legislatures. At this time we have no reason to believe these state laws will be reversed. If the laws are reversed, our system will have no market. P hone Data Solutions: Southern ITS and the consulting team it assembles for each job, ensures we have the capacity to lead you through each and every step required for the complete design and installation of all network systems.

True systems integration can only be successfully implemented with in-depth knowledge about technology trends, system architecture, as well as older technology currently utilized. In addition, design and implementation experience is required to develop an integration plan that will avoid pitfalls that will diminish your return on investment. Southern ITS uses its experience to bring the power of integration to benefit clients. Instead of multiple systems comprising CCTV, access control, and fire alarms One.

Throughout the design process, Southern ITS engineering team takes into consideration all aspects of the solution life-cycle including cost, performance, energy efficiency, regulatory requirements, custom configurations, branding, logistics, order fulfillment and support. Security Systems Integration : Many organizations facility security resembles a patchwork of various, independent systems than invariably detract from the overall effectiveness of the system. Surveillance cameras may be part analog and part digital, each kind on their own independent system requiring a different knowledge base for each system. Access Control may be independent of the surveillance monitoring systems or may even consist of stand-alone units for each door. Fire alarms may also reside on another monitoring systems. Many times deficiencies in a patchwork of security measures are not realized until it is too late. Southern ITS has over three decades of providing security integration services for facilities large and small. Designing, specifying, installing, and training brings fire, access control, and video surveillance all into one system, viewable from a single monitor or tablet or cell phone for real-time reporting and response to effectively document, record, and most importantly mitigate problems before they start. Is your hardware considered ancient technology? The idea of ripping out your existing analog system is not only very impractical, it is extremely cost prohibitive.

[Reserved] Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We are a development stage corporation with limited operations and no revenues from our business operations. We do not anticipate that we will generate significant revenues until we have raised significant funds. There is no assurance we will ever generate revenue even if we raised all necessary funds. GOING CONCERN Our financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any revenues. This means that we believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014 NOTE 1 NATURE AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Southern ITS International, Inc. (formerly Alco Advanced Technologies, Inc.) Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 27, 1984. On March 21, 2012, the Company changed its name from Alco Advanced Technologies, Inc. to Southern ITS International, Inc. The Company executed a share exchange with Southern ITS Corporation the Subsidiary in which the result was Southern ITS becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Refer to Note 9 for more information. The Company s operations consist of providing turnkey integration of electronic security systems for various types of industries, such as transportation, gaming and other secure operations in both government and private sectors. The integration includes surveillance, access control, network infrastructure, data communications and fire and burglar alarm systems. Today, security technologies are evolving rapidly and require remote access through various networks, firewalls and internet security. Surveillance systems and access control are all network dependent and work best for the end user when they are completely integrated. The Company s mission is to provide a complete integration of the various electronic security systems with the computer networks that they are dependent upon and ensuring that the systems will remain secure from potential cyber attack. On July 17, 2014, the Company enacted a 1-for-50 reverse stock split. The Company has adjusted all periods presented for the effects of the stock split. On August 15, 2014, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to decrease its authorized shares of common stock from Two Hundred Fifty Million (250,000,000) shares to Fifty Million (50,000,000) shares, with a par value of 0.001. The Company remains to have Ten Million (10,000,000) preferred shares with par value of 0.001 authorized. The Company designated 10,000,000 Series A Preferred Stock which have preferred voting rights equal to 500 votes for each 1 preferred share. NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of presentation The Company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The accompanying audited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in The United States of America and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position and results of operations. It is management s opinion, however, that all material adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair financial statements presentation. The results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year. Restatement of Financial Statements Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been adjusted to conform to the current period presentation pursuant to a 1 for 50 reverse stock split. Basis of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and Southern ITS as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 for the periods then ended. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Neither these financial statements nor the notes have been reviewed by our auditors F-6 Table of Contents Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates and assumptions impact, among others, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, due to continuing and expected future losses, and share-based payments. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from estimates. Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company minimizes its credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution. The balance at times may exceed federally insured limits. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where it is aware of a specific customers ability to meet its financial obligations, it records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected. For all other customers, it recognizes reserves for bad debts based on historical experience. The company had an allowance for doubtful account balance of 0 at December 31, 2015 and 2014. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Paragraph 820-10-35-37 to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10- 35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below: Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data. The carrying amount of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. Neither these financial statements nor the notes have been reviewed by our auditors F-7 Table of Contents The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis, consequently, the Company did not have any fair value adjustments for assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014; no gains or losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date ended December 31, 2015 and,2014. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of 5 to 7 years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations when incurred. Betterment and renewals are capitalized when deemed material. When property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset account and related accumulated depreciation account are relieved, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Intangible Assets Valuation of intangible assets include significant estimates and assumptions such as estimating future cash flows from product sales, developing appropriate discount rates, estimating probability rates for the successful completion of projects, continuation of customer relationships and renewal of customer contracts, and approximating the useful lives of the intangible assets acquired. Long Lived Assets The Company reviews the recover-ability of the carrying value of identified intangibles and other long-lived assets, including fixed assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recover-ability of these assets is determined based upon the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of such asset and its eventual disposition. The Company s estimate of future cash flows is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance, growth rates and other factors. The actual cash flows realized from these assets may vary significantly from its estimates due to increased competition, changes in technology, fluctuations in demand, consolidation of its customers and reductions in average selling prices. If the carrying value of an asset is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash flows, the asset is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the asset. Revenue recognition The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) the collectability is reasonably assured. There are no price incentives and the product can only be returned if defective. As the Company does not believe defective merchandise is likely an allowance has not been recognized. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis with corresponding costs of goods as a reduction to revenue in cost of sales. The Company s subsidiary earned the majority of the Company s revenues in 2012 from installing network surveillance systems. The Company applies the percentage-of-completion revenue recognition principles of accounting when recording revenues for ongoing projects. Risks and uncertainties The Company operates in an industry that is subject to rapid change. The Company s operations are subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial and operational risks including the potential risk of business failure. Also, see Note 3 regarding going concern matters. Segment information During 2015 and 2014, the Company only operated in one segment; therefore, segment information has not been presented. Neither these financial statements nor the notes have been reviewed by our auditors F-8 Table of Contents Share based payments Generally, all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights, are measured at their fair value on the awards grant date, and based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Share-based payment awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment, whichever is more readily determinable. The expense resulting from share-based payments are recorded as a component of general and administrative expense. Earnings per share In accordance with accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential of shares of common stock outstanding during the period including stock options or warrants, using the treasury stock method (by using the average stock price for the period to determine the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants), and convertible debt or convertible preferred stock, using the if-converted method. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential of shares of common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive. At December 31, 2015, there were 30,166,314 potential dilutive shares outstanding which relate to the outstanding warrants with exercise prices below the closing trading price of the Company s stock as of December 31, 2015. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 740-20, Income Taxes Intra-period Tax Allocation, clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740-20 by prescribing guidance for the recognition, de-recognition and measurement in financial statements of income tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns or tax positions expected to be taken in tax returns, including a decision whether to file or not to file in a Particular jurisdiction. FASB ASC Topic 740-20 requires that any liability created for unrecognized tax benefits is disclosed. The application of FASB ASC Topic 740-20 may also affect the tax bases of assets and liabilities and therefore may change or create deferred tax liabilities or assets. Recent accounting pronouncements On January 15, 2014 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-08, Intangibles Accounting for Goodwill (Topic 350):. The Update simplifies the accounting alternative, if elected, to goodwill existing as of the beginning of the period of adoption and any new goodwill recognized in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014. In April 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17, Revenue Recognition Milestone Method (Topic 605): Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition (codified within ASC 605 - Revenue Recognition). ASU 2013-45 provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for construction contracts. Company management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. Neither these financial statements nor the notes have been reviewed by our auditors F-9 Table of Contents NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN The Company s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of 8,911,236 from inception (September 27, 1984) to December 31, 2015. Its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to generate profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to address the going concern issue by funding future operations through the sale of equity capital and by director loans, if needed. The Company is in the development stage and anticipates that it will be able to have profitable operations in the near future. The Company believes its current available cash, along with anticipated revenues, will be sufficient to meet its cash needs for the near future. There can be no assurance that future financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue its operations is dependent on Management s plans, which include the raising of capital through debt and/or equity markets with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The Company may need to incur additional liabilities with certain related parties to sustain the Company s existence. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. In response to these problems, management has taken the following actions: seeking additional debt and/or equity financing, continue with development and implementation of the business plan, assess business markets and related opportunities so that more significant revenues can be generated, and allocation of sufficient resources to continue with service product marketing efforts. NOTE 4 - REVERSE STOCK SPLIT On August 4, 2014, the Company executed a reverse stock split whereby the holders of stock in the Company, Southern ITS International, Inc., received one (1) post reverse stock-split share of common stock, 0.001 par value per share, in exchange for every fifty (50) shares of common stock (in effect, a 1 for 50 reverse split). The Company has adjusted the equity statement and equity portion of the balance sheet to retroactively account for the reverse stock split as if it occurred at inception. NOTE 5 - PREPAIDS The prepaid asset balance at December 31, 2015, is a prepaid office rent deposit of 2,000 NOTE 6 - FIXED ASSETS At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 the Company has the following fixed assets: December 31, December 31, 2015 2014 Furniture Equipment 5,808 5,808 Less: Accumulated Depreciation (3,190 (2,360 Fixed Assets, net 2,618 3,448 Depreciation expense for the period ended December 31, 2015 was 830.

The Company was returned the initial 400,000 post reverse-split shares from Jason Bell whom is the President of the Company and previous sole shareholder of Southern ITS. The 4,000,000 post reverse-split shares were then canceled and Mr. Bell was issued a new certificate for 400,000 post reverse-split common shares.

Cancelled Shares In the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company cancelled 4,000,000 post reverse-split outstanding common shares to an officer of the Company for failing to provide contracted services.

Neither these financial statements nor the notes have been reviewed by our auditors F-14 Table of Contents On November 17, 2015 the company issued 1,750,000 shares of restricted common stock to JJMJ Consulting.

However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm its business. Southern ITS International has no pending or threatened legal proceedings or administrative actions either by or against the issuer that could have a material effect on the issuer s business, financial condition, or operations and any current, past or pending trading suspensions by a securities regulator. NOTE 12 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On June 16, 2015 Southern ITS signed a surveillance system installation contract with a privately owned Casino Resort, located in the state of Mississippi. The currently stipulated contract amount is 1.5 million. Management feels that the final contract amount will potentially be higher, after system change orders are received during the project. The preliminary work on the project was begun in late June 2015, but management did not bill for any work until July. Revenues and costs of the project will be reported using the construction percentage of completion method, in the coming months. Management is contesting certain trade accounts payable of approximately 25,000. The full amounts have been reported, but management will keep trying to reduce and resolve the outstanding balances. On June 29, 2017, the Company and our President, Sylvain Desrosiers, entered into an Exchange Agreement with David McCovy whereby Mr. McCovy transferred 100 of the ownership interests in Evolution Enterprises, Inc. Evolution in exchange for 76,500,000 shares of common stock of Southern ITS International, Inc. As a part of the transaction, effective June 30, 2017 the Company returned the existing business, operations, assets and liabilities of the Company to Mr. Desrosiers and/or his designee, with the exception of 136,144 of promissory notes payable by the Company. Later in 2017, it was determined that Evolution had no value, and Mr. Desrosiers rescinded the Exchange Agreement. At the same time, Mr. McCovy was removed as President/CEO and a Director of the Company and Mr. Desrosiers re-assumed those positions. In October 2020 Mr. Desrosiers resigned and James E. Shipley was elected as the sole officer and director of Company. Subsequently, on July 13, 2022, the Company filed a lawsuit in Clark County Nevada District Court, Case no. A-22-855339-C, seeking cancelation of a total of 89,172,000 shares of its common stock, 76,500,000 shares of which were previously issued to Mr. McCovy arising out of the acquisition by SITS of Evolution in 2017. The remaining 12,672,000 shares of SITS common stock were caused to be issued by Mr. McCovy to his associates during the period of time that he served as CEO of the Company. Under its present management, the Company found no evidence of any payment of assets (other than the rescinded Evolution acquisition), or services received by the Company in exchange for issuance of the shares of common stock. Pursuant to a Court Order dated January 19, 2023, the Company and the Company s transfer agent canceled an aggregate of 86,225,000 shares of Company common stock, including the 76,500,00 shares owned by Mr. McCovy effective January 23, 2023. Management has evaluated subsequent events pursuant to the requirements of ASC Topic 855 and has determined that no additional material subsequent events exist at the time of this report. Neither these financial statements nor the notes have been reviewed by our auditors F-15 Table of Contents Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accounting and Financial Disclosures. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management s control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our CEO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based upon this evaluation, our CEO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which is described below. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 14 Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2015. Our CEO concluded we have a material weakness due to lack of segregation of duties, a limited corporate governance structure, and a lack of a formal management review process over preparation of financial information. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our size has prevented us from being able to employ sufficient resources to enable us to have an adequate level of supervision and segregation of duties within our system of internal control. Therefore, while there are some compensating controls in place, it is difficult to ensure effective segregation of accounting and financial reporting duties. Management reported the following material weaknesses: Lack of segregation of duties in certain accounting and financial reporting processes including the initiation, processing, recording and approval of disbursements; Our corporate governance responsibilities are performed by the Board of Directors, none of whom are independent under applicable standards; we do not have an audit committee or compensation committee. Our Board of Directors acts primarily by written consent without meetings which results in several of our corporate governance functions not being performed concurrent (or timely) with the underlying transactions, including evaluation of the application of accounting principles and disclosures relating to those transactions; and Certain reports that we prepare, and accounting and reporting conclusions reached in connection with the financial statement preparation process are not subjected to a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review and are not submitted timely to the Board of Directors for review or approval. While we strive to segregate duties as much as practicable, there is an insufficient volume of transactions at this point in time to justify additional full-time staff. We believe that this is typical in many development-stage companies. We may not be able to fully remediate the material weakness until we commence operations at which time, we would expect to hire more staff. We will continue to monitor and assess the costs and benefits of additional staffing. This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the SEC rules that permit us to provide only management s report in this Annual Report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 15 Table of Contents Item 9B.
