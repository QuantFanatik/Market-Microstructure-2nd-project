 PART I 
 ITEM 1. Bu siness 
 Our Business 
 PTC is a global software company that provides a portfolio of innovative digital solutions that work together to transform how physical products are engineered, manufactured, and serviced. 
 Our software portfolio includes award-winning offerings that enable companies to author product data (our computer-aided design (CAD) portfolio solutions) and to manage product data and orchestrate processes (our product lifecycle management (PLM) portfolio solutions). 
 Our software can be delivered on premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid model. Our customers include some of the world's most innovative companies in the aerospace and defense, automotive, electronics and high tech, industrial machinery and equipment, life sciences, retail and consumer products industries. 
 We generate revenue through the sale of subscriptions, which include term-based on-premises software licenses and related support, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and hosting services; perpetual licenses; support for perpetual licenses; and professional services (consulting, implementation, and training). 
 Recent Developments 
 We acquired the ServiceMax cloud-native field service management business in Q2 23, broadening our PLM solution set to encompass the service phase of the product lifecycle. We paid the first purchase payment installment of 835 million, as adjusted for working capital, indebtedness, cash, and transaction expenses, in January 2023, and the second and final installment of 650 million in October 2023. Refer to Note 6. Acquisitions and Disposition of Businesses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion about the ServiceMax transaction.

 Table of Contents 
 Our Strategy 
 We pursue multiple strategic initiatives designed to create value for our customers, increase our Annual Run Rate (ARR) and free cash flow, and deliver long-term value for stockholders. 
 
 Subscription Business Model 
 
 Our transition from a perpetual and maintenance model to a subscription business model continues to be key to driving growth. Our subscription model offers greater benefits of scale and growth potential, drives higher customer engagement and retention, and provides better business predictability, with over 90 of our annual revenues being recurring in nature. This, in turn, enables us to make steady and sustained investments to pursue mid-to-long-term growth opportunities. 
 Customer Expansion 
 
 Our solutions portfolio encompasses the entire product life cycle, from design to manufacture to service, enabling companies to adopt a digital thread strategy to drive innovation and productivity. A digital thread manages product data and makes it accessible and useful to the right people, at the right time, and in the right context. The digital thread is particularly valuable for customers with complex products that tend to have longer life cycles. We seek to drive value for our customers by offering new and enhanced features and products that enable our customers to pursue and expand their digital thread strategies. 
 
 Our acquisition strategy targets companies with products that complement ours and that we believe will appeal to our existing customer base, allowing us to pursue cross-selling opportunities. The addition of ServiceMax in 2023 for the SLM part of our PLM portfolio further extends what was already a unique portfolio of interconnected digital thread capabilities across the full product life cycle. The addition of Codebeamer in 2022 for the ALM part of our PLM portfolio strengthened our offerings in the ALM space as software becomes integral to more and more products, especially in regulated industries where traceability is safety-critical. 
 
 PLM Expansion 
 
 PLM is at the heart of digital transformation and has become essential technology at industrial companies. No longer confined to the Engineering department, PLM data is driving decision-making across organizations, enabling them to improve how products are designed, manufactured, and serviced. 
 
 Our goal is to be the category leader in PLM and to provide our customers with best-in-class solutions to drive innovation and productivity. 
 
 SaaS Transition 
 
 We continue to invest in the transformation of our technology portfolio to include more SaaS offerings. Our acquisitions of Onshape, Arena, and ServiceMax brought cloud-native solutions to our portfolio, and we continue to work towards creating and expanding SaaS offerings for our existing products. We believe that SaaS products represent a strong value proposition for our customers, offering reduced complexity; lower costs to implement, upgrade and administer; better user collaboration and mobility; and scalability. This is a longer-term strategy as we expect that SaaS adoption in the CAD and PLM markets will be gradual at first, then accelerate significantly, given constraints such as the length and cost of conversion projects and budgeting timelines of our customers.

 Our Markets and How We Address Them 
 The markets we serve present different growth opportunities for us. The PLM market is undergoing expansion as PLM plays a larger role in industrial companies. Within PLM, we've extended our reach in the growing SLM and ALM spaces through our acquisitions of ServiceMax and Codebeamer. Across all our solutions, we see opportunity for further market growth with a new generation of SaaS solutions we are developing to bring to market over the next few years. 
 We derive most of our sales from products and services sold directly by our sales force to end-user customers. Approximately 25 of our sales of products and services are through third-party resellers. Our sales force focuses on large accounts, while our reseller channel provides a cost-effective means of covering the small- and medium-size business market. Our strategic alliance partners enable us to increase our market reach, offer broader solutions, and add compelling technology to our offerings. Our strategic services partners provide service offerings to help customers implement our product offerings and transition to SaaS.

 Proprietary Rights 
 Our software products and related technical know-how, along with our trademarks, including our company names, product names and logos, are proprietary. We protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights, trademarks, patents and common law safeguards, including trade secret protection. The nature and extent of such legal protection depends in part on the type of intellectual property right and the relevant jurisdiction. In the U.S., we are generally able to maintain our trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use and to maintain our patents for up to 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. We also use license management and other anti-piracy technology measures, as well as contractual restrictions, to curtail the unauthorized use and distribution of our products. 
 Our proprietary rights are subject to the risks and uncertainties described under Item 1A. Risk Factors below, which is incorporated into this section by reference. 
 Environmental Sustainability 
 At PTC, we re motivated to become an impactful contributor to the dematerialization and decarbonization of global manufacturing. While we have a climate action plan committed to reduce our company s footprint, we believe far larger benefits will flow from our handprint stemming from our software offerings. Our software solutions enable manufacturers to design, build, and service their products more sustainably. 
 Footprint 
 In 2023, we announced our footprint reduction commitment via the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) and submitted near-term and net-zero targets for validation by SBTi. Our submitted near-term commitment is to reduce combined Scope 1 (direct emissions from owned/controlled operations) and Scope 2 (indirect energy use) emissions by 50 and reduce Scope 3 - Category 1 (Purchased Goods and Services) 25 compared to our 2022 baseline by 2030. Our long-term net-zero commitment is to reach net-zero across all scope emissions by 2050, with absolute reductions of over 90 across Scopes 1-3, with accredited carbon removal offsets for the remaining 
 While we await SBTi approval of our near-term and net-zero targets, we have already begun to implement programs and pursue initiatives to reduce our emissions and carbon footprint, including: 
 prioritizing energy efficiency and accessibility to public transportation when selecting office space; 

increasing our subsidy for employee s public transportation commute costs; and 

consolidating our data center operations with providers committed to mid-decade 100 renewable energy and advancing circular outcomes. 

Handprint 
 Environmental sustainability is integral to our product offerings. With our software, manufacturers can drive sustainability improvement, including by designing with less material, enhancing product repairability and circularity, improving factory efficiency, and enabling remote service.

 ITEM 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 The following are important factors we have identified that could affect an investment in our securities. You should consider them carefully when evaluating an investment in PTC securities, because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or any forward-looking statements. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. 
 I. Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry 
 We face significant competition, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects if we are unable to successfully compete. 
 The markets for our products and solutions are rapidly changing and characterized by intense competition, disruptive technology developments, evolving distribution models and increasingly lower barriers to entry. If we are unable to provide products and solutions that address customers needs as well as our competitors products and solutions do, or to align our pricing, licensing and delivery models with customer preferences, we could lose customers and/or fail to attract new customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. 
 For example, customer demand for SaaS solutions is increasing. While our Arena, ServiceMax, and Onshape solutions are cloud-native SaaS solutions, and we have introduced our Windchill+, Creo+, and Kepware+ SaaS solutions, customers may not adopt them as we expect. If we are unable to compete successfully with competitors offering SaaS solutions, we could lose customers and/or fail to attract new customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. 
 Our current and potential competitors range from large and well-established companies to emerging start-ups. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition in the markets we serve and greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, and other resources, which could limit our ability to gain customer recognition and confidence in our products and solutions and successfully sell our products and solutions, which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. 
 A breach of security in our products or computer systems, or those of our third-party service providers, could compromise the integrity of our products, cause loss of data, harm our reputation, create additional liability and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. 
 We have implemented and continue to implement measures intended to maintain the security and integrity of our products, source code and IT systems. The potential for a security breach or system disruption has significantly increased over time as the scope, number, intensity and sophistication of attempted cyberattacks and cyber intrusions have increased particularly cyberattacks and intrusions designed to access and exfiltrate information and to disrupt and lock up access to systems for the purpose of demanding a ransom payment. It is impossible for us to eliminate the risk of a successful cyberattack or intrusion, and, in fact, we regularly deal with security issues and have experienced security incidents from time to time. Accordingly, there is a risk that a cyberattack or intrusion will be successful and that such event will be material. 
 In addition, we offer cloud services to our customers and some of our products, including our SaaS products, are hosted by third-party service providers, which expose us to additional risks as those repositories of our customers proprietary data may be targeted and a cyberattack or intrusion may be successful and material. Interception of data transmission, misappropriation or modification of data, corruption of data and attacks against our service providers may adversely affect our products or product and service delivery. Malicious code, viruses or vulnerabilities that are undetected by our service providers may disrupt our business operations generally and may have a disproportionate effect on those of our products that are developed and delivered in the cloud environment.

 Table of Contents 
 While we devote resources to maintaining the security and integrity of our products and systems, as well as performing due diligence of our third-party service providers, security breaches that have not had a material effect on our business or that of our customers have occurred, and we will continue to face cybersecurity threats and exposure. A significant breach of the security and/or integrity of our products or systems, or those of our third-party service providers, whether intentional or by human error by our employees or others, could disrupt our business operations or those of our customers, could prevent our products from functioning properly, could enable access to sensitive, proprietary or confidential information of our customers, or could enable access to our sensitive, proprietary or confidential information. This could require us to incur significant costs of investigation, remediation and/or payment of a ransom; harm our reputation; cause customers to stop buying our products; and cause us to face lawsuits and potential liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. 
 We increasingly rely on third-party providers of cloud infrastructure services to deliver our offerings to users on our platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of these services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. 
 Our continued growth depends in part on the ability of our existing and potential customers to use and access our cloud services or our website in order to download our software or encrypted access keys for our software within an acceptable amount of time. We use a number of third-party service providers that we do not control for key components of our infrastructure, particularly with respect to development and delivery of our cloud-based products. The use of these service providers gives us greater flexibility in efficiently delivering a more tailored, scalable customer experience, but also exposes us to additional risks and vulnerabilities. Third-party service providers operate their own platforms that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to their service interruptions. We may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time as a result of problems with our third-party service providers infrastructure. Lack of availability of this infrastructure could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks that we cannot predict or prevent. Such outages could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 If we are unable to renew our agreements with our cloud service providers on commercially reasonable terms, or any of our agreements are prematurely terminated, or we need to add new cloud services providers to increase capacity and uptime, we could experience interruptions, downtime, delays, and additional expenses related to transferring to and providing support for these new platforms. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platforms and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 We may be unable to hire or retain employees with the necessary skills to operate and grow our business, which could adversely affect our ability to compete and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 Our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees to develop our products and solutions and to operate and grow our business. Competition for such employees in our industry is intense worldwide, and particularly in the Boston, Massachusetts area where our global headquarters is located. 
 If we are unable to attract and retain employees with the requisite skills to develop our products and solutions, or to guide, operate and support our business, we may be unable to compete successfully, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

 We depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing sector and our business could be adversely affected if manufacturing activity does not grow or if it contracts, or if manufacturers are adversely affected by other macroeconomic factors. 
 A large amount of our sales are to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector. Manufacturers worldwide continue to face uncertainty about the global macroeconomic environment due to, among other factors, the effects of earlier and ongoing supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates and inflation, volatile foreign exchange rates and the current relative strength of the U.S. Dollar, and the U.S. government s focus on technology transactions with non-U.S. entities. Customers may delay, reduce, or forego purchases of our solutions due to these challenges and concerns, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 If we fail to successfully transform our operations to support the sale of SaaS solutions and to develop competitive SaaS solutions, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. 
 Transforming our business to offer and support SaaS solutions requires considerable additional investment in our organization. Whether we will be successful and will accomplish our business and financial objectives is subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to: customer demand, attach and renewal rates, channel adoption, our ability to further develop and scale infrastructure, our ability to include functionality and usability in such offerings that address customer requirements, our ability and the ability of our partners to transition existing customer implementations and subscriptions to SaaS, and our costs. If we are unable to successfully establish these new offerings and navigate our business transition, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected. 
 Because our sales and operations are globally dispersed, we face additional compliance risks, and any compliance failure could adversely affect our business and prospects. 
 We sell and deliver software and services, and maintain support operations, in many countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes. Managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws of those countries and those of the U.S. governing our activities in non-U.S. countries. 
 Those laws include, but are not limited to, anti-corruption laws and regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010), data privacy laws and regulations (including the European Union's General Data Privacy Regulation), and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations (including laws administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the United Nations Security Council and other sanctions authorities). Our compliance risks are heightened due to the go-to-market approach for our business that relies heavily on a partner ecosystem, the fact that some of the countries we operate in have a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices, the fact that we sell to governments and state-owned business enterprises, and the fact that global enforcement of laws has significantly increased. 
 Accordingly, while we strive to maintain a comprehensive compliance program, an employee, agent or business partner may violate our policies or U.S. or other applicable laws or we may inadvertently violate such laws. Investigations of alleged violations of those laws can be expensive and disruptive. Violations of such laws can lead to civil and/or criminal prosecutions, substantial fines and other sanctions, including the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations, and also cause business loss and reputational harm, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

 II. Risks Related to Acquisitions and Strategic Relationships 
 Businesses we acquire may not generate the sales and earnings we anticipate and may otherwise adversely affect our business and prospects. 
 We have acquired, and intend to continue to acquire, new businesses and technologies. If we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire, if an acquisition does not further our business strategy or return a level of sales as we expect, or if a business we acquire has unexpected legal or financial liabilities, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected. 
 The types of issues that we may face in integrating and operating the acquired business include: 
 difficulties managing an acquired company s technologies or lines of business or entering new markets where we have limited or no prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; 

unanticipated operating difficulties in connection with the acquired entities, including potential declines in sales of the acquired entity; 

complications relating to the assumption of pre-existing contractual relationships of an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into, the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business; 

litigation arising from the transaction, including potential intellectual property claims or disputes following an acquisition; 

diversion of management and employee attention; 

challenges with implementing adequate and appropriate controls, procedures and policies in an acquired business; 

potential loss of key personnel in connection with an acquisition; and 

potential incompatibility of business cultures. 

Further, if we do not achieve the expected return on our investments, it could impair the intangible assets and goodwill that we recorded as part of an acquisition, which could require us to record a reduction to the value of those assets. 
 We may incur significant debt or issue a material amount of debt or equity securities to finance an acquisition, which could adversely affect our operating flexibility, business and prospects. 
 If we were to incur a significant amount of debt whether by borrowing funds under our credit facility or otherwise or issuing new debt securities to finance an acquisition, our interest expense, debt service requirements and leverage would increase significantly. The increases in these expenses and in our leverage could constrain our ability to operate as we might otherwise or to borrow additional amounts and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 If we were to issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with an acquisition, existing stockholders would be diluted and our stock price could decline. 
 Our inability to maintain or develop our strategic and technology relationships could adversely affect our business and prospects. 
 We have many strategic and technology relationships with other companies with which we work to offer complementary solutions and services, that market and sell our solutions, and that provide technologies that we embed in our solutions. We may not realize the expected benefits from these 
 12 
 
 Table of Contents 
 relationships and such relationships may be terminated by the other party. If these companies fail to perform or if a company terminates or substantially alters the terms of the relationship, we could suffer delays in product development, reduced sales or other operational difficulties and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected. 
 III. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 
 We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which could adversely affect our business and our prospects. 
 Our software products are proprietary. We protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights, trademarks, patents and common law safeguards, including trade secret protection, as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties. Despite these measures, the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property. In addition, we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software. If our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail, others may be able to use those rights, which could reduce our competitiveness and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. 
 In addition, any legal action to protect our intellectual property rights that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly, may distract management from day-to-day operations and may lead to additional claims against us, and we may not succeed, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. 
 Intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us, which could be expensive to defend, could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property, and could adversely affect our business and prospects. 
 The software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights. We have faced such lawsuits from time to time. Any such claim could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. We cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims. If we did not prevail, we could be prevented from using the claimed intellectual property or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which might not be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products, some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these third-party technologies. 
 IV. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness 
 Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, as well as our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt. 
 We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of November 17, 2023, our total debt outstanding was approximately 2,307 million and 85 million, 1 billion of which was associated with the 3.625 Senior Notes and 4.000 Senior Notes (together, Senior Notes issued in February 2020, which mature in February 2025 and 2028, respectively, and are unsecured; 807 million and 85 million of which was borrowed under our credit facility revolving line, which matures in January 2028; and 500 million of which was borrowed under our credit facility term loan, which begins amortizing in March 2024. All amounts outstanding under the credit facility and the Senior Notes will be due and payable in full on their respective maturity dates. As of November 17, 2023, we had unused commitments under our credit facility of approximately 350 million. PTC Inc. and one of our foreign subsidiaries are eligible borrowers under the credit facility and certain other foreign subsidiaries may become borrowers under our credit facility in the future, subject to certain conditions. 
 13 
 
 Table of Contents 
 Specifically, our level of debt could: 
 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations and other ongoing business obligations, which may result in defaults; 

result in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt instruments, which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable or require us to negotiate an amendment to financial or other covenants that could cause us to incur additional fees and expenses; 

limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements; 

reduce the availability of our cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; 

increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; 

amplify the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our credit facility, are at variable rates of interest; 

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industries in which we operate, and the overall economy; and 

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors. 

Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreements. 
 Despite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt and other obligations. This could further exacerbate the risks to our business, financial condition, and prospects described above. 
 We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations in the future, including secured debt. Although the credit agreement governing our credit facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. The additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the credit agreement and the indenture governing our Senior Notes due 2025 and 2028, will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, or we incur other obligations, the related risks that we now face could intensify. 
 We may not be able to generate enough cash to service all our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful, and could harm our business and prospects. 
 Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. 
 14 
 
 Table of Contents 
 If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our debt agreements restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. 
 Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy our debt obligations. 
 If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and the lenders under our credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings, the holders of our Senior Notes could declare all outstanding principal, premium, if any, and interest to be due and payable, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. These events could result in a loss of your investment. 
 We are required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our debt agreements. Any failure to comply with those covenants could cause amounts borrowed to become immediately due and payable and/or prevent us from borrowing under the credit facility. 
 We are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants under our debt agreements and to make payments under our debt, which limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any debt payment obligations could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, would result in any amounts outstanding, including any accrued interest and/or unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. We might not have enough working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations if those obligations were accelerated. In addition, if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants under the credit facility when we wish to borrow funds, we will be unable to borrow funds to pursue certain corporate initiatives, including strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business and prospects. 
 V. Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
 Our stock price has been volatile, which may make it harder to resell shares at a favorable time and price. 
 Market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Accordingly, the trading prices and valuations of software companies stocks, and of ours, may not be predictable. Negative changes in the public s perception of the prospects of software companies, or of PTC or the markets we serve, could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results. 
 Also, a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors. Purchases and sales of our common stock by these investors could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock. 
 If our results of operations do not meet market or analysts expectations, our stock price could decline. 
 Our quarterly operating results fluctuate depending on many factors, including the effect of ASC 606 on revenue recognition for the on-premises software subscriptions we offer, variability in the timing of start dates for our subscription and SaaS offerings, length of contracts, and renewals, and significant unexpected expenses in a quarter. Accordingly, our quarterly results are difficult to predict and we may 
 15 
 
 Table of Contents 
 be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a quarter until that quarter has closed. If our quarterly operating results do not meet market or analysts expectations, our stock price could decline. 
 VI. General Risk Factors 
 Our international businesses present economic and operating risks, which could adversely affect our business and prospects. 
 We expect that our international operations will continue to expand and to account for a significant portion of our total revenue. Because we transact business in various foreign currencies, the volatility of foreign exchange rates has had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our revenue, expenses and operating results. 
 Other risks inherent in our international operations include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations; 

exposure of our operations and employees to political instability and armed conflict in the countries and regions in which we operate, including Israel; 

increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; 

increased regulatory and compliance risks; 

inadequate local infrastructure; and 

greater difficulty in protecting our intellectual property. 

We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate, which could increase our income tax expense, reduce our net income, and increase our tax payment obligations. 
 As a multinational organization, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. 
 Our effective tax rate and tax payment obligations can be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including: 
 changes in tax laws (for example, the introduction of an amendment to Section 174 of the U.S. tax legislation), regulations, and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate; 

assessments, and any related tax interest or penalties, by taxing authorities; 

changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates; 

changes to the financial accounting rules for income taxes; 

unanticipated changes in tax rates; and 

changes to a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets, if any.

 Operating and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Our discussion of results includes discussion of our ARR (Annual Run Rate) operating measure, non-GAAP financial measures, and disclosure of our results on a constant currency basis. ARR and our non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons we use those measures, are described below in Results of Operations - Operating Measure and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures, respectively. The methodology used to calculate constant currency disclosures is described in Results of Operations - Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange on Results of Operations. You should read those sections to understand our operating measure, non-GAAP financial measures, and constant currency disclosures. 
 Executive Overview 
 ARR grew 26 (23 constant currency) to 1.98 billion as of the end of FY'23 compared to FY 22. Organic ARR, which excludes contributions from the ServiceMax business we acquired in Q2'23, grew 15 (13 constant currency) year over year to 1.81 billion. Organic ARR growth was driven by double-digit growth across all product groups and geographies. 
 We generated 611 million of cash from operations in FY 23 compared to 435 million in FY 22, an increase of 40 . Free cash flow of 587 million in FY'23 increased 41 from 416 million in FY'22. Our cash flow growth is attributable to strong collections driven by our solid top-line growth from our subscription business model and operational discipline. Interest payments were 41 million higher in FY'23 compared to FY'22, while restructuring payments decreased 39 million year-over-year. We ended FY 23 with cash and cash equivalents of 288 million and gross debt of 1.70 billion, with an aggregate weighted average interest rate of 5.2 . 
 Revenue growth of 8 (12 constant currency) in FY'23 compared to FY'22 was primarily due to the contributions from ServiceMax and Codebeamer. The timing of revenue recognition for on-premises subscription revenue can vary significantly, impacting reported revenue and growth rates. Interest expense was 75 million higher in FY'23 compared to FY'22, which adversely affected our net income and earnings per share results. The increase was driven by debt and liabilities related to the ServiceMax acquisition. 
 Results of Operations 
 The following table shows the measures that we consider the most significant indicators of our business performance. In addition to providing operating income, operating margin, diluted earnings per share and cash from operations as calculated under GAAP, we provide our ARR operating measure and non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow for the reported periods. We also provide a view of our actual results on a constant currency basis. Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the items described in Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. Investors should use our non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with our GAAP results.

Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange on Results of Operations 
 Approximately 50 of our revenue and 35 of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because we report our results of operations in U.S. Dollars, currency translation, particularly changes in the Euro, Yen, Shekel, and Rupee relative to the U.S. Dollar, affects our reported results. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates were a headwind to reported income statement results in FY 23. However, ARR was positively impacted by improvements in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate, as of September 30, 2023 compared to September 30, 2022. 
 The results of operations in the table above, and the tables and discussions below about revenue by line of business and product group present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis. Our constant currency disclosures are calculated by multiplying the results in local currency for FY'23 and FY'22 by the exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2022. If FY'23 reported results were converted into U.S. Dollars using the rates in effect as of September 30, 2022, ARR would have been lower by 38 million, revenue would have been lower by 59 million, and expenses would have been lower by 26 million. If FY'22 reported results were converted into U.S. Dollars using the rates in effect as of September 30, 2022, ARR would have been the same, revenue would have been lower by 112 million, and expenses would have been lower by 50 million.

 Revenue 
 Under ASC 606, the volume, mix, and duration of contract types (support, SaaS, on-premises subscription) starting or renewing in any given period can have a material impact on revenue in the period, and as a result can impact the comparability of reported revenue period over period. We recognize revenue for the license portion of on-premises subscription contracts up front when we deliver the licenses to the customer, typically on the start date, and we recognize revenue on the support portion of on-premises subscription contracts and stand-alone support contracts ratably over the term. We continue to convert existing perpetual support contracts to on-premises subscriptions, resulting in a shift to up-front recognition of on-premises subscription license revenue in the period converted compared to ratable recognition for a perpetual support contract. Revenue from our cloud services (primarily SaaS) contracts is recognized ratably. We expect that over time a higher portion of our revenue will be recognized ratably as we continue to expand our SaaS offerings, release additional cloud functionality into our products, and migrate customers from on-premises subscriptions to SaaS. Given the different mix, duration and volume of new and renewing contracts in any period, year-over-year or sequential revenue can vary significantly.

Software revenue in FY'23 benefited from contributions from ServiceMax, acquired early in Q2'23, and Codebeamer, acquired in Q3'22. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates were a headwind to year-over-year revenue growth. 
 Within software revenue, license revenue is impacted by the quantity and size of expiring and renewing multi-year on-premises subscription contracts, along with the duration of those contracts that start in the period. In FY'23, the weighted-average duration of contracts starting in the year decreased compared to FY'22 primarily due to a few high-value renewal contracts in FY'22 that had longer than typical durations. Because longer duration contracts typically have a higher total contract value, which drives the amount of upfront license revenue recognized for on-premises contracts, this year-over-year duration decrease represented a headwind to license revenue growth in FY'23. 
 Professional services revenue decreased in FY'23 as we continue to execute on our strategy of leveraging partners to deliver services rather than contracting to deliver services ourselves, including the Q3'22 sale of a portion of our PLM services business to ITC Infotech (which branded the business DxP Services). Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also contributed to the year-over-year revenue decline. These decreases were partially offset by ServiceMax professional services revenue. 
 Our expectation is that professional services revenue will continue to trend down over time as we execute on our partner strategy and deliver products that require less consulting and training services.

PLM software revenue growth in FY'23 benefited from contributions from ServiceMax and Codebeamer. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates were a headwind to year-over-year revenue growth. Excluding contributions from ServiceMax and Codebeamer, constant currency revenue growth was driven by Windchill and IIoT in the Americas. 
 PLM ARR grew 36 (34 constant currency) from Q4 22 to Q4'23, driven by ServiceMax, which contributed 171 million of ARR; Windchill; IIoT; and Codebeamer. 
 CAD software revenue was negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Constant currency revenue growth was flat due to decreases in Creo revenue in Europe due to shorter durations of on-premises subscription contracts, offset by Creo revenue growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific. 
 CAD ARR grew 12 (10 constant currency) in FY'23 compared to FY'22, driven by Creo.

 License gross margin decreased in FY 23 compared to FY 22 due to lower license revenue and higher royalty expense. 
 Support and cloud services gross margin increased in FY 23 compared to FY 22 due to higher support and cloud services revenue, partially offset by increases in cost of support and cloud services, which were driven by higher royalty expenses, compensation costs, higher intangible amortization expense due to the ServiceMax acquisition, and cloud hosting costs.

 Table of Contents 
 Professional services gross margin decreased in FY 23 compared to FY 22 due to lower professional services revenue, offset by lower professional services costs. The decrease in professional services revenue is mainly due to the sale of a portion of our PLM services business in FY'22 and continued execution on our strategy of leveraging partners to deliver services rather than contracting to deliver services ourselves.

Total headcount increased by 11 between FY'22 and FY'23, primarily driven by our acquisition of ServiceMax. 
 Operating expenses in FY'23 compared to FY'22 increased primarily due to the following: 
 a 90 million increase in compensation expense (including stock-based compensation and benefit costs), primarily due to our acquisition of ServiceMax; 

a 12 million increase in marketing expense, primarily due to our Q3'23 LiveWorx event; 

an 11 million increase in software subscriptions and internal hosting costs; 

a 10 million increase in travel expenses; 

partially offset by: 
 a 38 million decrease in restructuring charges, primarily due to the restructuring plan initiated and substantially completed in FY'22.

The effective tax rate for FY 23 was higher than the effective rate for FY 22, primarily due to tax expense of 21.8 million related to an uncertain tax position regarding transfer pricing in a foreign jurisdiction where we are currently under audit. Our rate was also impacted by tax expense of 6.3 million related to non-deductible imputed interest related to the deferred payment on the acquisition of ServiceMax Inc. Additionally, in FY'22, our rate included 8.1 million of tax expense arising from the basis difference on goodwill related to the sale of a portion of our PLM services business. 
 In the normal course of business, PTC and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities, including the IRS in the United States. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. We are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions including Germany, Ireland, and Italy. Audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items, transfer pricing, limitations on net operating losses, and tax credits.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
 We invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions. Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. 
 A significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside the U.S. As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 35 million in the U.S., 111 million in Europe, 121 million in Asia Pacific (including India), and 21 million in other non-U.S. countries. We have substantial cash requirements in the U.S., but believe that the combination of our existing U.S. cash and cash equivalents, our ability to repatriate cash to the U.S., future U.S. operating cash flows, and cash available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our ongoing U.S. operating expenses and known capital requirements. 
 Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities increased by 175.6 million in FY'23 compared to FY'22. This increase was driven by higher collections, including contributions from ServiceMax, offset by higher vendor disbursements and higher interest payments due to a higher debt burden and higher interest rates. Cash from operations in FY'23 includes 1.5 million of restructuring payments and 19.6 million of acquisition and transaction-related payments compared to 40.8 million of restructuring payments and 11.8 million of acquisition and transaction-related payments in FY'22. 
 Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities in FY'23 was driven by the acquisition of ServiceMax, with 828.2 million paid in Q2'23. Cash used in investing activities in FY'22 was driven by the acquisition of the Codebeamer business for 278.1 million, offset by 46.9 million of proceeds from the sale of an investment and 32.5 million of proceeds from the sale of a portion of our PLM services business. 
 Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities in FY 23 was primarily related to net new borrowings of 771.0 million (a 500.0 million term loan and a 271.0 million incremental revolving line) to fund the ServiceMax acquisition and net repayments of 428.0 million on the new revolving facility. Cash used in financing activities in FY 22 includes repayments of 355.0 million under our credit facility and repurchases of common stock of 125.0 million, offset by borrowings of 264.0 million to fund our acquisition of the Codebeamer business.

 In addition to the debt shown in the above table, as of September 30, 2023, we had a 620 million deferred acquisition payment liability related to the fair value of the 650 million installment paid in October 2023 for the ServiceMax acquisition. Of the 650 million paid, 620 million has been recorded as a financing outflow and the 30 million of imputed interest has been recorded as an operating cash outflow in our Q1'24 financials. To finance this payment and the payment for the acquisition of pure-systems in Q1'24, we borrowed 740 million under the revolving line of our credit facility. This is described in Note 18. Subsequent Events of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. 
 As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility and the Senior Note indentures. Any failure to comply with such covenants under the credit facility would prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the credit facility, and, as with any failure to comply with such covenants under the Senior Note indentures, could constitute a default that could cause all amounts outstanding to become due and payable immediately. Loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates which reset every 30 to 180 days. As of September 30, 2023, the annual rates for borrowings outstanding under the credit facility revolver line and term loan were both 7.2 . 
 Our credit facility and our Senior Notes are described in Note 9. Debt of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. 
 Expectations for 2024 
 We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements (which we expect to be approximately 20 million in FY 24) through at least the next twelve months and to meet our known long-term capital requirements. 
 For the remainder of FY'24, we expect to use substantially all our cash generated from operating activities to repay debt outstanding under our credit facility revolving line. 
 Our expected uses and sources of cash could change, our cash position could be reduced, and we could incur additional debt obligations if we decide to retire other debt, engage in strategic transactions, or repurchase shares, any of which could be commenced, suspended, or completed at any time. Any such repurchases or retirement of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved in any debt retirement or issuance, share repurchases, or strategic transactions may be material. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 At September 30, 2023, our future contractual obligations were related to debt, deferred acquisition payments, leases, pension liabilities, unrecognized tax benefits, and purchase obligations. See Note 6. Acquisitions and Disposition of Businesses, Note 9. Debt, Note 17. Leases, Note 14. Pension Plans, and Note 8. Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for information about those obligations, which Notes are incorporated by reference into this section. Our purchase obligations were approximately 164.7 million, with 75.9 million expected to be paid in FY'24 and 88.8 million thereafter. Purchase obligations represent minimum commitments due to third parties, including royalty contracts, research and development contracts, telecommunication contracts, information technology maintenance contracts in support of internal-use software and hardware, financing leases, operating leases with original terms of less than 12 months, and other marketing and consulting contracts. Contracts for which our commitment is variable or based on volumes with no fixed minimum quantities and contracts that can be canceled without payment penalties are not included in the purchase obligation amounts above. The purchase obligations included above are in addition to amounts included in Current liabilities and Prepaid expenses recorded on our September 30, 2023 Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately 13.1 million (of which 0.5 million was collateralized).

 Operating Measure 
 ARR 
 ARR (Annual Run Rate) represents the annualized value of our portfolio of active subscription software, cloud, SaaS, and support contracts as of the end of the reporting period. We calculate ARR as follows: 
 We consider a contract to be active when the product or service contractual term commences (the start date until the right to use the product or service ends (the expiration date ). Even if the contract with the customer is executed before the start date, the contract will not count toward ARR until the customer right to receive the benefit of the products or services has commenced. 

For contracts that include annual values that increase over time, which we refer to as ramp contracts, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include any future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation . 

As ARR includes only contracts that are active at the end of the reporting period, ARR does not reflect assumptions or estimates regarding future customer renewals or non-renewals. 

Active contracts are annualized by dividing the total active contract value by the contract duration in days (expiration date minus start date), then multiplying that by 365 days (or 366 days for leap years). 

We believe ARR is a valuable operating measure to assess the health of a subscription business because it is aligned with the amount that we invoice the customer on an annual basis. We generally invoice customers annually for the current year of the contract. A customer with a one-year contract will typically be invoiced for the total value of the contract at the beginning of the contractual term, while a customer with a multi-year contract will be invoiced for each annual period at the beginning of each year of the contract. 
 ARR increases by the annualized value of active contracts that commence in a reporting period and decreases by the annualized value of contracts that expire in the reporting period. 
 As ARR is not annualized recurring revenue, it is not calculated based on recognized or unearned revenue and is not affected by variability in the timing of revenue under ASC 606, particularly for on-premises license subscriptions where a substantial portion of the total value of the contract is recognized as revenue at a point in time upon the later of when the software is made available, or the subscription term commences. 
 ARR should be viewed independently of recognized and unearned revenue and is not intended to be combined with, or to replace, either of those items. Investors should consider our ARR operating measure only in conjunction with our GAAP financial results. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The non-GAAP financial measures presented in the discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable GAAP measures are: 
 free cash flow cash flow from operations 

non-GAAP gross margin GAAP gross margin 

non-GAAP operating income GAAP operating income 

non-GAAP operating margin GAAP operating margin

non-GAAP diluted earnings per share GAAP diluted earnings per share 

Free cash flow is cash flow from operations net of capital expenditures, which are expenditures for property and equipment and consist primarily of facility improvements, office equipment, computer equipment, and software. We believe that free cash flow, in conjunction with cash from operations, is a useful measure of liquidity since capital expenditures are a necessary component of ongoing operations. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures other than free cash flow exclude, as applicable: stock-based compensation expense; amortization of acquired intangible assets; acquisition and transaction-related charges included in General and administrative expenses; restructuring and other charges (credits), net; non-operating charges (credits), net; and income tax adjustments. 
 The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We do not include these items, which can vary significantly from period to period, when reviewing our operating results internally because we do not consider them to be part of our core operating results. Excluding them facilitates evaluation of our ongoing performance, our earnings trends, and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with our GAAP results, as should investors. 
 Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense relating to stock-based awards issued to executive officers, employees and outside directors, consisting of restricted stock units. We exclude this expense as it is a non-cash expense and we assess our internal operations excluding this expense and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry. 
 Amortization of acquired intangible assets is a non-cash expense that is impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions. We believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry. 
 Acquisition and transaction-related charges included in General and administrative expenses are direct costs of potential and completed acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities, including transaction fees, due diligence costs, severance and professional fees. Subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are also included within acquisition and transaction-related charges. Other transactional charges include third-party costs related to structuring merger and acquisition transactions outside of ordinary business operations. We do not include these costs when reviewing our operating results internally. The occurrence and amount of these costs will vary depending on the timing and size of acquisitions and transactions. 
 Restructuring and other charges (credits), net includes excess facility restructuring charges (credits); impairment and accretion expense charges related to the lease assets of exited facilities; sublease income from previously impaired facilities; severance charges resulting from reductions of personnel; and third-party professional consulting fees related to modifications of our business strategy. These costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan. 
 Non-operating charges (credits), net are gains or losses associated with sales or changes in value of assets or liabilities that are generally investing or financing in nature and are not indicative of our ongoing ordinary operating activities. In FY'23, we recognized a financing charge for a debt commitment agreement associated with our acquisition of ServiceMax. In FY'22, we recorded gains associated with the sale of assets, including the sale of a portion of our PLM services business, and we recorded a loss associated with the reduction in value of an equity investment in a publicly-traded company. 
 27 
 
 Table of Contents 
 Income tax adjustments include the tax impact of the items above. Additionally, we exclude other material tax items that we do not include when reviewing our operating results internally. For example, in FY 23, adjustments include a charge related to an uncertain tax position in a foreign jurisdiction. 
 We use these non-GAAP financial measures, and we believe that they assist our investors, to make period-to-period comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not, in our view, indicative of our core operating results. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business, and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals (communicated internally and externally) for managing our business and evaluating our performance. We believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures also affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of other companies in our industry that use similar financial measures to supplement their GAAP results. 
 The items excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur. Accordingly, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following tables reconcile each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most closely comparable GAAP measure on our financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues, results of operations, and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained, and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time. 
 The accounting policies, methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. The most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved: 
 revenue recognition; 

accounting for income taxes; and 

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations. 

A critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate, and different estimates that we could have used, or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur, may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Accounting policies, guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators. These rule makers and/or regulators may promulgate interpretations, guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.

 Revenue Recognition 
 We record revenues in accordance with the guidance provided by ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . For a full description of our revenue accounting policy, refer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. 
 Our sources of revenue include: (1) subscriptions, (2) perpetual licenses, (3) support for perpetual licenses, and (4) professional services. Subscriptions include term-based on-premises licenses and related support, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and hosting services. 
 Judgments and Estimates 
 Determination of performance obligations. Our subscriptions are frequently sold as a bundle of products and services, typically pairing on-premises term software licenses with support and, for certain offerings, cloud services over the same term. Significant judgment is used in determining the performance obligations related to these bundled products and services. On-premises software is typically determined to be a distinct performance obligation and is thus recognized separately from the support and cloud components. On-premises license software revenue is generally recognized at the point in time that the software is made available to the customer, while the support and cloud software revenue components are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. In cases where subscriptions include cloud functionality and on-premises software, an assessment has been performed to determine whether the cloud services are distinct from the on-premises software. In the substantial majority of instances, cloud services provide incremental functionality to customers and have been considered distinct and recognized separately from the on-premises software. This assessment could have a significant impact on the timing of revenue recognition and may change as our product offerings evolve. 
 Allocation of transaction price. We estimate the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation and use that estimate to allocate the transaction price among said performance obligations. The estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us, including market conditions and other observable inputs. Significant judgment is used in determining the standalone selling prices of the on-premises license, support, and cloud components of our subscription products. These estimates are subject to change as our product offerings change and could have a significant impact due to the difference in the timing of revenue recognition for on-premises licenses versus support and cloud. 
 Right to exchange. Our multi-year, non-cancellable subscription contracts provide customers with an annual right to exchange software within the original subscription with other software. When it applies to on-premises licenses, we account for this right as a liability. For most contracts, we use the expected value method to determine the liability associated with this right across a portfolio of contracts. Where contracts are outside of the standard portfolio of contracts due to contract size, longer contract duration, or other unique contractual terms, we use the most likely amount method to determine the liability for each individual contract. In both circumstances, the transaction price is constrained based on our estimates, which impacts the amount of revenue recognized. Changes in these estimates could significantly impact revenue for any given period. 
 Accounting for Income Taxes 
 As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction. There are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain; as a result, our calculations involve estimates by management. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue-sharing, cost-reimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions. If we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements, that revision could affect our recorded tax liabilities. 
 30 
 
 Table of Contents 
 The income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense. 
 We have unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2023 of 50.7 million. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates. We believe it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to the resolution of multi-jurisdictional tax positions could be reduced by up to 26 million as audits close and statutes of limitations expire. 
 As of September 30, 2023, we have a valuation allowance of 17.4 million against net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and a valuation allowance of 4.3 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowance recorded in the U.S. relates to Massachusetts tax credit carryforwards that we do not expect to realize a benefit from prior to expiration. 
 The valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our capital loss carryforwards, the majority of which do not expire. However, there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such capital losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits. We will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period. 
 Prior to the passage of the U.S. Tax Act, we asserted that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely invested and accordingly, no deferred taxes were provided. Pursuant to the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, these earnings were subjected to a one-time transition tax and there is therefore no longer a material cumulative basis difference associated with the undistributed earnings. We maintain our assertion to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. unless repatriation can be done substantially tax-free, with the exception of a foreign holding company formed in 2018 and our Taiwan subsidiary. If we decide to repatriate any additional non-U.S. earnings in the future, we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings would not be material. 
 In the normal course of business, PTC and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the U.S. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. We are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions. Audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items, transfer pricing, limitations on net operating losses and tax credits. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates. 
 Valuation of Assets and Liabilities Acquired in Business Combinations 
 In accordance with business combination accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. 
 Our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of purchased software, tradenames, customer lists and contracts, and software support agreements and related relationships. Purchased software consists of products that have reached technological feasibility and the combination of processes, inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products. Customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company s installed base. We have 
 31 
 
 Table of Contents 
 generally valued intangible assets using discounted cash flow models. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to: 
 future expected revenues and costs related to software license sales, customer support agreements, customer contracts and related customer relationships and acquired developed technologies and trademarks and trade names; and 

discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows. 

In addition, we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset. 
 Net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations. Except for deferred revenues, net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company, if we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date. For acquisitions completed prior to FY'22, the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company s software support contracts. During FY'22, we adopted ASU 2021-08, whereby deferred revenue for acquisitions completed in FY'22 and thereafter reflect the amounts that would have been deferred as of the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606. 
 In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the estimated value of uncertain tax positions or tax-related valuation allowances, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. 
 When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible asset may not be recoverable, we perform an assessment of the asset for potential impairment. This assessment is based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset s remaining life. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset, determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 In accordance with recently issued accounting pronouncements, we will be required to comply with certain changes in accounting rules and regulations, none of which are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated (to the extent of our ownership interest therein) into our financial statements. We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us.

 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We face exposure to financial market risks, including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. 
 Foreign currency exchange risk 
 Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to Eurozone countries, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, China and India. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts and options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that arise from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. We do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Our non-U.S. revenues generally are transacted through our non-U.S. subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency. In addition, expenses that are incurred by our non-U.S. subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency. Approximately 50 of our revenue and 35 of our expenses were transacted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in U.S. Dollars. Historically, our most significant currency risk has been changes in the Euro and Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. Dollar. Based on current revenue and expense levels (excluding restructuring charges and stock-based compensation), a 0.10 change in the USD to EUR exchange rate and a 10 Yen change in the Yen to USD exchange rate would impact operating income by approximately 30 million and 6 million, respectively. 
 Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions, with most intercompany transactions occurring between a U.S. Dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity. Intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk. Also, both PTC (the parent company) and our non-U.S. subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency (transaction risk). In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars (translation risk). If sales to customers outside the United States increase, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will increase. 
 Our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the U.S. Dollar value of balances denominated in foreign currency, resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts and options to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations. The contracts are primarily denominated in the Euro, Swedish Krona, and Swiss Franc currencies, and have maturities of less than four months. 
 The majority of our foreign currency forward contracts and options are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings. Because we enter into these derivative contracts only as an economic hedge, any gain or loss on the underlying foreign-denominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the derivative contract. Gains and losses on these derivatives and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables are included in Other income, net.

Debt 
 In addition to the 1 billion due under our 2025 and 2028 Senior Notes, as of September 30, 2023, we had 702 million outstanding under our credit facility. We also had a 620 million deferred acquisition payment liability related to the fair value of the 650 million installment for the ServiceMax acquisition, which we paid in October 2023 leveraging financing from our credit facility. Loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates which reset every 30 to 180 days depending on the rate and period selected by us. These loans are subject to interest rate risk as interest rates will be adjusted at each rollover date to the extent such amounts are not repaid. As of September 30, 2023, the annual rate on the credit facility loans was 7.18 . If there were a 100 basis point change in interest rates, the annual net impact to earnings and cash flows would be 7 million. This change in cash flows and earnings has been calculated based on the borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2023 and a 100 basis point per annum change in interest rate applied over a one-year period. 
 Cash and cash equivalents 
 As of September 30, 2023, cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. We invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds. At September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 35 million in the United States, 111 million in Europe, 121 million in Asia Pacific (including India), and 21 million in other non-U.S. countries. Given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at September 30, 2023, a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents. 
 Our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and, for non-U.S. operations, foreign currency exchange rate risk. In a declining interest rate environment, we would experience a decrease in interest income. The opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment. Over the past several years, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, European Central Bank and Bank of England have changed certain benchmark interest rates, which has led to declines and increases in market interest rates. These changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. Interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar had a favorable impact of 2.9 million and an unfavorable impact of 24.2 million on our consolidated cash balances in FY'23 and FY'22, respectively. The impact in FY'23 was due in particular to changes in the Euro and the Korean Won.

 ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As required by SEC Rule 15d-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2023. 
 Management excluded ServiceMax from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 because it was acquired in a business combination in the current fiscal year. ServiceMax's total assets and total revenues represent approximately 1 (excluding the impact of goodwill and intangibles from the acquisition) and 7 , respectively, of our total assets and total revenues, as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

35 
 
 Table of Contents 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment and those criteria, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears under Item 8. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 ITEM 9B. Other Information 
 Item 5.02	Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. 
 On November 16, 2023, Michael DiTullio, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, Kristian Talvitie, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Catherine Kniker, Executive Vice President, Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer, and Aaron von Staats, Executive Vice President, General Counsel entered into new Executive Agreements with PTC Inc. (the Company ). The new Executive Agreements replace the executives existing Executive Agreements with the Company. 
 The Executive Agreements provide certain compensation and employment protections to the executives. Each Executive Agreement provides that, upon a change in control of the Company, (i) all performance measures under any outstanding equity award held by the executive will be deemed to have been met at the target level, and (ii) the executive will receive a payment in an amount equal to the pro-rata portion of the executive s target incentive bonus for the current year. Upon any termination of the executive s employment after a change in control of the Company, (i) all equity awards held by the executive will accelerate and vest in full, (ii) the executive will receive a payment in an amount equal to: (a) 100 of the executive s highest base salary in the six months preceding the termination date, plus (b) 100 of the executive s highest applicable target bonus, and (iii) the executive will be entitled to continued participation in the Company s medical, dental and vision benefit plans (the Benefit Plans for one year, or payment of an amount sufficient to purchase substantially equivalent benefits if continued participation is not permitted under the applicable Benefit Plan or if the Benefit Plan is terminated. The Executive Agreement also provides that, upon termination of the executive s employment by the Company without cause (i) the executive will receive a payment in an amount equal to 100 of the executive s highest base salary in the six months preceding the termination date plus 100 of the executive s target bonus for the year in which the termination occurs, (ii) all equity awards held by the executive that would have vested in the twelve months following the termination date will vest, and (iii) the executive will be entitled to continued participation in the Benefit Plans or payment in lieu thereof as described above. The Executive Agreement also provides that upon termination of the executive s employment by the Company due to the executive s death or disability, all equity held by the executive will vest in full. Mr. DiTullio s Executive Agreement also provides that if he voluntarily terminates his employment after September 30, 2025, or if he is terminated without cause, all outstanding equity held by him will continue to vest after such termination in accordance with its terms, which continued equity vesting after termination without cause replaces the equity acceleration described above in the event of termination without cause. To receive the payments and benefits under the Executive Agreement, the

 APPENDIX A 
 Report of Independent Re gistered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PTC Inc. 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PTC Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 As described in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded ServiceMax, Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of 
 F- 1 
 
 Table of Contents 
 September 30, 2023 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during fiscal 2023. We have also excluded ServiceMax, Inc. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. ServiceMax, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 1 and 7 , respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Revenue Recognition - Identification of Distinct Performance Obligations 
 As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s sources of revenue include: (1) subscriptions, (2) perpetual licenses, (3) support for perpetual licenses and (4) professional services. Revenue is derived from the licensing of computer software products, cloud-based offerings, and related support and professional services contracts. During the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized revenue from contracts with customers of 2,097 million. The Company s contracts with customers for subscriptions typically include commitments to transfer term-based, on-premises software licenses bundled with support and/or cloud services. On-premises software is determined to be a distinct performance obligation from support. As disclosed by management, significant judgment is used in determining the performance obligations related to these bundled products and services. The corresponding revenues are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - identification of distinct performance obligations, is a critical audit matter are the (i) significant judgment by management when identifying the distinct performance obligations, and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management s identification of distinct performance obligations within contracts with 
 F- 2 
 
 Table of Contents 
 customers. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the identification of distinct performance obligations. These procedures also included, among others (i) evaluating the Company s revenue recognition accounting policy and (ii) testing management s identification of distinct performance obligations in its contracts with customers by examining revenue contracts on a sample basis and evaluating whether these performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or satisfied over time. 
 Acquisition of ServiceMax, Inc. Valuation of the Customer Relationships and Purchased Software Intangible Assets 
 As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed its acquisition of ServiceMax, Inc. on January 3, 2023, for purchase consideration of 1,448.2 million, net of cash acquired. The Company has accounted for the acquisition of ServiceMax, Inc. as a business combination. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation resulted in 512.7 million of customer relationships and 106.9 million of purchased software being recorded. Management estimated the fair value of the customer relationships and purchased software intangible assets using discounted cash flow models which included significant estimates and assumptions related to future revenues, costs and an applicable discount rate. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the customer relationships and purchased software intangible assets in the acquisition of ServiceMax, Inc. is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the customer relationships and purchased software acquired, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to future revenues, costs and the discount rate for the customer relationships and future revenues and the discount rate for the purchased software intangible assets; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management s valuation of the customer relationships and purchased software acquired. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimate of the customer relationships and purchased software acquired; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models used by management to develop the fair value estimates; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the discounted cash flow models used by management to develop the fair value estimates; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to future revenues, costs and the discount rate for the customer relationships and future revenues and the discount rate for the purchased software intangible assets. Evaluating management s assumptions related to future revenues, costs and the discount rate for the customer relationships intangible asset and the future revenues and the discount rate for the purchased software intangible asset involved considering (i) the consistency with external economic and industry data, (ii) the past performance of the acquired business, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models and the reasonableness of the discount rate assumptions.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

We enter into contracts that include combinations of licenses, support, cloud-based offerings, and professional services, each of which are accounted for as separate performance obligations with differing revenue recognition patterns referenced below.

 Judgments and Estimates Our contracts with customers for subscriptions typically include commitments to transfer term-based, on-premises software licenses bundled with support and/or cloud services. Significant judgment is used in determining the performance obligations related to these bundled products and services. On-premises software is determined to be a distinct performance obligation from support which is sold for the same term of the subscription. For subscription arrangements which include cloud services and on-premises licenses, we assess whether the cloud component is highly interrelated with the on-premises term-based software licenses. Other than a limited population of subscriptions, the cloud component is not currently deemed to be interrelated with the on-premises term software and, as a result, cloud services are accounted for as a distinct performance obligation from the software and support components of the subscription. Judgment is required to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation. We use the estimated standalone selling price method to allocate the transaction price for items that are not sold separately. The estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us, including market conditions and other observable inputs. The corresponding revenues are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied. Where subscriptions include on-premises software and support only, we determined th at approximately of the estimated standalone selling price for subscriptions is attributable to software licenses and approximately i s attributable to support for those licenses. Some of our subscription offerings include a combination of on-premises and cloud-based technology. In such cases, the cloud-based technology is generally considered distinct and receives an allocation of approximately to of the estimated standalone selling price of the subscription. The amounts allocated to cloud are based on assessment of the relative value of the cloud functionality in the subscription, with the remaining amounts allocated between software and support. Our multi-year, non-cancellable subscription contracts provide customers with an annual right to exchange software within the original subscription with other software. Although the exchange right is limited to software products within a similar product grouping, the exchange right is not limited to products with substantially similar features and functionality as those originally delivered. We determined that, for on-premises licenses, this right to exchange previously delivered software for different software represents variable consideration to be accounted for as a liability. We have identified a standard portfolio of contracts with common characteristics and applied the expected value method of determining variable consideration associated with this right. Additionally, in isolated situations that are outside of the standard portfolio of contracts due to contract size, longer contract duration, or other unique contractual terms, we use the most likely amount method to determine the amount of variable consideration. In both circumstances, the variable consideration included in the transaction price is constrained to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the total liability was million and million, respectively, primarily associated with the annual right to exchange on-premises subscription software. Practical Expedients We have elected certain practical expedients associated with our revenue recognition policy. We do not account for significant financing components if the period between revenue recognition and when the customer pays for the products or services is one year or less. Additionally, we recognize revenue equal to the amount we have a right to invoice when the amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance to date. 
 
 t hold any marketable securities. In D ecember 2020, we sold all our marketable securities to partially fund the Arena acquisition, resulting in proceeds of million. Neither gross realized gains nor gross realized losses related to the sale were material. 
 million prior to the business combination. Our preferred shares were converted into common shares of Matterport, wh ich were restricted from sale until January 2022. For the year ended September 30, 2021, we recorded an unrealized gain of million on the appreciation of the value of the shares in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In 2022, we sold all shares held for a total of million. The shares sold included those held as of September 30, 2021, as well as additional shares that we earned based on contingent earn-outs. In the year ended September 30, 2022, we recognized a net loss of million in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The aggregate realized gain from the original investment of million was million. As of and subsequent to September 30, 2022, PTC held no shares in Matterport. 

. Generally, we do not designate these foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings. Because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge, any gain or loss on the underlying foreign-denominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract. Gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in Other income, net. We hedge our forecasted U.S. Dollar cash flows with foreign exchange options to reduce the risk that they will be adversely affected by changes in Euro or Japanese Yen exchange rates. We did not hold any foreign currency option contracts as of September 30, 2023. We do not designate these foreign currency options as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings. Because we enter into options as an economic hedge, currency impacts on the Euro or Japanese Yen-denominated operations as compared to the forecasted plan rate may be partially offset by gains on the options. Gains and losses on foreign exchange options are included in Other income, net. Net Investment Hedges We translate balance sheet accounts of subsidiaries with foreign functional currencies into the U.S. Dollar using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We designate certain foreign exchange forward contracts as net investment hedges against exposure on translation of balance sheet accounts of Euro and Japanese Yen functional subsidiaries. Net investment hedges partially offset the impact of foreign currency translation adjustment recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All foreign exchange forward contracts are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the maximum duration of net investment hedge foreign exchange forward contracts is approximately . Net investment hedge relationships are designated at inception, and effectiveness is assessed retrospectively on a quarterly basis using the net equity position of Euro and Japanese Yen functional subsidiaries. As the forward contracts are highly effective in offsetting exchange rate exposure, we record changes in these net investment hedges in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently upon contract maturity reclassify them to Foreign currency translation adjustment in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness. Our derivatives are not subject to any credit contingent features. We manage credit risk with counterparties by trading among several counterparties, and we review our counterparties credit at least quarterly. 
 Certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities. These variable payments include insurance, taxes, consumer price index payments, and payments for maintenance and utilities. Our operating leases expire at various dates throug h . 
 , and furniture and fixtures over three to . Leasehold improvements are amortiz ed over the shorter of their useful lives or the remaining terms of the related leases. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred; additions and improvements are capitalized. When an item is sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation is relieved, and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in income. 
 internal development costs for software to be sold externally were capitalized in 2023, 2022 or 2021 . We purchased software of million, million, and million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Additionally, we acquired capitalized software through business combinations (for further detail, see Note 6. Acquisitions and Disposition of Businesses ). These assets are included in Acquired intangible assets, net in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 operating segments Software Products and Professional Services to a single operating segment. The key factors evaluated included our organization structure, financial results reviewed by the CODM, and compensation structure, among others. This change reflects our strategy to focus our professional services business on high-value services and to leverage partners to provide services, while delivering products that require fewer consulting and training services. Based on this change, we determined we have a single reportable segment. 
 million and to the Professional Services segment was million. Based on our qualitative assessment, we concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of our Software Products reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no further impairment testing was required. Based on a comparison of the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the Professional Services reporting unit as of June 30, 2023, no impairment was required. After combining the reporting units, we performed a step zero qualitative assessment on the combined goodwill balance and determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the combined reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and no further impairment testing is required. Through September 30, 2023, there were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated that the carrying values of goodwill or acquired intangible assets may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets primarily include property and equipment and acquired intangible assets with finite lives (including purchased software, customer lists and trademarks). Purchased software is amortized over periods up to years, customer lists are amortized over periods up to years and trademarks are amortized over periods up to years. We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate. An impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset or asset group. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis.

Deferred revenue 

As of September 30, 2023, million of our contract assets are expected to be transferred to receivables within the next 12 months and therefore are included in Other current assets. The remainder is included in Other assets and expected to be transferred within the next 24 months. As of September 30, 2022, million of our contract asset balance was included in Other current assets with the remainder included in Other assets. Approximately million of the September 30, 2022 contract asset balance was transferred to receivables during the year ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the right to payment becoming unconditional. Additions to contract asset of approximately million primarily related to revenue recognized in the period, net of billings. There were impairments of contract assets in the year ended September 30, 2023. During the year ended September 30, 2023, we recognized million of revenue that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2022. There were additional deferrals of million, primarily related to new billings. In addition, the acquisition of ServiceMax added million of deferred revenue. For subscription contracts, we generally invoice customers annually. Costs to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the benefit of those costs is expected to be longer than one year. These deferred costs (primarily commissions) are amortized proportionately related to revenue over years, which is generally longer than the term of the initial contract because of anticipated renewals as commissions for renewals are not commensurate with commissions related to our initial contracts. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, deferred costs of million and million, respectively, were included in Other current assets and million and million, respectively, were included in Other assets. Amortization expense related to costs to obtain a contract with a customer was million and million in the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively. There were substantial imp airments of the contract cost asset in the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Remaining Performance Obligations Our contracts with customers include transaction price amounts allocated to performance obligations that will be satisfied and recognized as revenue at a later date. As of September 30, 2023, the transaction price amounts include additional performance obligations of million recorded in deferred revenue and million that are not yet recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to recognize approximately of the total million over the next months, with the remaining amount thereafter.

Acquisition and transaction-related costs include direct costs of potential and completed acquisitions (e.g., investment banker fees and professional fees, including legal and valuation services) and expenses related to acquisition integration activities (e.g., professional fees and severance). Other transactional charges include third-party costs related to structuring unusual transactions, such as the divestiture of a portion of our business. These costs are classified in General and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our results of operations include or exclude, as applicable, the results of acquired or sold businesses beginning on their respective acquisition or sale date. The acquisitions described below have been accounted for as business combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the respective acquisition date. The fair values of intangible assets were based on valuations using discounted cash flow models which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including estimating future revenues, future costs, and an applicable discount rate. The excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill. ServiceMax On January 3, 2023, we acquired ServiceMax, Inc. pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated November 17, 2022 by and among PTC, ServiceMax, Inc., and ServiceMax JV, LP. ServiceMax develops and licenses cloud-native, product-centric field service management (FSM) software, which is included within our PLM product group. The purchase price of million, net of cash acquired, was payable in two installments. Upon closing of the transaction, PTC paid the first installment of million, as adjusted for working capital, indebtedness, cash, and transaction expenses as set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement. The remaining installment of million, of which million represents the fair value as of the acquisition date and million is imputed interest, was paid in October 2023. The fair value of the deferred acquisition payment was calculated based on our borrowing rate at the time of the acquisition. PTC borrowed million under the revolving line of our new credit facility and million under the term loan of the new credit facility to repay amounts under the prior credit facility and to pay the closing purchase price and transaction expenses related to the acquisition. ServiceMax had approximately employees on the close date. In the year ended September 30, 2023 , ServiceMax revenue was million and ServiceMax earnings were immaterial. million increase in customer relationships, a million increase in net tax liability, and a million decrease in goodwill compared to the balances reported as of March 31, 2023 . We have also recorded a liability of million related to the fair value of the million deferred purchase price payment.

In 2023, 2022, and 2021, our effective tax rate is impacted by our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at a net effective tax rate lower than the U.S. rate. A significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in Ireland and the Cayman Islands. In 2023, 2022, and 2021, the foreign rate differential predominantly relates to these earnings. In addition to the foreign rate differential, our tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory federal income tax due to the net effects of the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) and Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) regimes (together referred to as U.S. Tax reform), and the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Additionally in 2023, our results include tax expense of million relating to an uncertain tax position regarding transfer pricing in a foreign jurisdiction where we are currently under audit. Our rate was also impacted by non-deductible imputed interest related to the deferred payment on the acquisition of ServiceMax, Inc. In 2022, our results include tax expense relating to the book over tax basis difference in goodwill disposed of as part of the sale of a portion of the PLM services business. In 2021, our tax rate includes a benefit due to the release of the valuation allowance on the majority of our U.S. net deferred tax assets and the tax impact related to the effects of a tax matter in the Republic of Korea (South Korea). At September 30, 2023 and 2022, income taxes payable and income tax accruals recorded on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets were million million in Accrued income taxes, million in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and million in Other liabilities) and million million in Accrued income taxes, million in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and million in Other liabilities), respectively. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, prepaid taxes recorded in Prepaid expenses on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets were million and million, respectively. We made net income tax payments of million, million and million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Net deferred tax assets 

We reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period. We assess available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use our existing deferred tax assets. For U.S. tax return purposes, net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and tax credits are generally available to be carried forward to future years, subject to certain limitations. At September 30, 2023, we had U.S. federal tax effected NOL carryforwards from acquisitions of million, of which million expire in 2025 to 2034. The remaining carryforwards of million do not expire. The use of these NOL carryforwards is limited as a result of the change in ownership rules under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. As of September 30, 2023, we had federal R D credit carryforwards of million, which expire beginning in and ending in , and Massachusetts R D credit carryforwards of million, which expire beginning in and ending in . We also had foreign tax credits of million, which expire beginning in and ending in . We also have tax effected NOL carryforwards in non-U.S. jurisdictions totaling million, the majority of which do not expire, and non-U.S. tax credit carryforwards of million that expire beginning in and ending in . Additionally, we have tax effected amortization carryforwards of million in a foreign jurisdiction. There are limitations imposed on the use of such attributes that could restrict the recognition of any tax benefits. 

 million against net deferred tax assets in the United States and a valuation allowance of million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions. The million U.S. valuation allowance relates to Massachusetts tax credit carryforwards which we do not expect to realize a benefit from prior to expiration. The valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our capital loss carryforwards, the majority of which do not expire. However, there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such capital losses that could restrict the recognition of any tax benefits.

Our policy is to record estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of our income tax provision. In 2023, 2022 and 2021 we recorded interest expense of million, million and million, respectively. In 2023 and 2022 we had penalty expenses in our income tax provision. I n 2021 we had million tax penalty expense in our income tax provision. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had accrued million and million of net estimated interest expense, respectively. We had accrued tax penalties as of September 30, 2023, 2022 or 2021.

Unrecognized tax benefit, end of year 

If all of our unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2023 were to become recognizable in the future, we would record a benefit to the income tax provision of million (which would be partially offset by an increase in the U.S. valuation allowance of million). Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates. We believe it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to the resolution of multi-jurisdictional tax positions could be reduced by up to million as audits close and statutes of limitations expire. Our results for the year ended September 30, 2021 include a charge of million related to the effects of a tax matter in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) of million, and the resulting impact on U.S. income taxes of million, and additional payments of approximately million to South Korea in settlement of the amounts previously accrued. In the normal course of business, PTC and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities, including the IRS in the United States. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. We are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions, including Germany, Ireland, and Italy. Audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items, transfer pricing, limitations on net operating losses and tax credits. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates. 
 Additionally, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from certain earlier periods in these jurisdictions may be subject to examination to the extent they are used in later periods. We incurred expenses related to stock-based compensation in 2023, 2022 and 2021 of million, million and million, respectively. Accounting for the tax effects of stock-based awards requires that we establish a deferred tax asset as the compensation is recognized for financial reporting prior to recognizing the tax deductions. The tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations related to stock-based compensation totaled million, million and million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Upon vesting of the stock-based awards, the actual tax deduction is compared with the cumulative financial reporting compensation cost and any excess tax deduction is considered a windfall tax benefit and is recorded to the tax provision. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, net windfall tax benefits of million, million and million were recorded to the tax provision. Prior to the passage of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December of 2017 (the Tax Act), we asserted that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested and accordingly, no deferred taxes were provided. Pursuant to the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, these earnings were subjected to U.S. federal taxation via a one-time transition tax, and there is therefore no longer a material cumulative basis difference associated with the undistributed earnings. We maintain our assertion of our intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the United States unless repatriation can be done substantially tax-free, with the exception of a foreign holding company formed in 2018 and our Taiwan subsidiary. If we decide to repatriate any additional non-U.S. earnings in the future, we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings would not be material.

Senior Unsecured Notes In February 2020, we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term debt at par value, due in 2028 (the 2028 notes) and million in aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term debt at par value, due in 2025 (the 2025 notes). As of September 30, 2023, the total estimated fair value of the 2028 and 2025 notes was approximately million and million, respectively, based on quoted prices for the notes on that date. We were in compliance with all the covenants for all our Senior Notes as of September 30, 2023. Terms of the 2028 and 2025 Notes Interest on the 2028 and 2025 notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15. The debt indenture for the 2028 and 2025 notes includes covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, grant liens on our properties or capital stock, enter into sale and leaseback transactions or asset sales, and make capital distributions. We may, on one or more occasions, redeem the 2028 and 2025 notes in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. In certain circumstances constituting a change of control, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our ability to repurchase the notes upon such event may be limited by law, by the indenture associated with the notes, by our then-available financial resources or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time. If we fail to repurchase the notes as required by the indenture, it would constitute an event of default under the indenture which, in turn, may also constitute an event of default under other obligations. Credit Agreement In January 2023, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement for a new secured multi-currency bank credit facility with a syndicate of banks. Pursuant to the agreement, all revolving commitments under the prior credit agreement were replaced with the revolving commitments under the new credit facility. The new credit facility consists of (i) a billion revolving credit facility, (ii) a million term loan credit facility, and (iii) an incremental facility pursuant to which we may incur additional term loan tranches or increase the revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2023, unused commitments under our credit facility were approximately million and amounts available for borrowing were million. As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of our credit facility approximates its book value. PTC Inc. and certain eligible foreign subsidiaries are eligible borrowers under the credit facility. Any borrowings by PTC Inc. under the credit facility would be guaranteed by PTC Inc. s material domestic subsidiaries that become parties to the subsidiary guaranty, if any. As of the filing of this Form 10-K, ServiceMax, Inc. was the only subsidiary guarantor. Any borrowings by eligible foreign subsidiary borrowers would be guaranteed by PTC Inc. and any subsidiary guarantors and secured, subject to exceptions, by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all existing and after-acquired personal property owned by PTC Inc. and its material domestic subsidiaries (except for certain indirect material domestic subsidiaries). As of September 30, 2023 , all funds borrowed under the revolving credit facility were borrowed by an eligible foreign subsidiary borrower. Subsequent to September 30, 2023, we borrowed an additional million under the revolving credit facility, including million to finance the deferred payment related to the ServiceMax acquisition and million borrowed by the subsidiary borrower for our acquisition of pure-systems. Refer to Note 18. Subsequent Events for more detail. Loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates that reset every to days depending on the base rate (for USD borrowings, either the adjusted Daily Simple RFR or adjusted Term SOFR) and period selected by us. The spread over the base rate depends on our total leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2023, the annual rate for borrowings outstanding was . A quarterly revolving commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility is required, ranging from to per annum, based upon our total leverage ratio. The credit facility limits our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; incur liens or guarantee obligations; pay dividends and make other distributions; make investments and enter into joint ventures; dispose of assets; and engage in transactions with affiliates, except on an arms-length basis. Under the credit facility, PTC Inc. and its material domestic subsidiaries may not invest cash or property in, or loan amounts to, PTC Inc. s foreign subsidiaries in aggregate amounts exceeding million for purposes other than acquisitions of businesses. The credit facility also requires that we maintain certain financial ratios. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility. In 2023 , we incurred million in financing costs in connection with the January 2023 credit facility and related arrangements, of which million (related to a since-extinguished bridge loan) was expensed in the period and million was recorded as deferred debt issuance costs and included in Other assets and Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Deferred debt issuance costs are expensed over the term of the obligations. Interest In 2023, 2022 and 2021, we incurred interest expense of million, million, and million, respectively, and paid million, million and million, respectively, of interest on our debt. Interest expense in the year ended 2023 includes million of interest imputed on the million deferred acquisition payment related to the ServiceMax acquisition. The average interest rate on borrowings outstanding during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was approximately , and , respectively.

Legal and Regulatory Matters With respect to legal proceedings and claims, we record an accrual for a contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We are subject to legal proceedings and claims against us in the ordinary course of business. As of September 30, 2023, we estimate that the range of possible outcomes for such matters is immaterial and we do not believe that resolving them will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any of these legal proceedings and claims be resolved against us, the operating results for a reporting period could be adversely affected. Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations We enter into standard indemnification agreements with our customers and business partners in the ordinary course of our business. Under such agreements, we typically indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to our products. Indemnification may also cover other types of claims, including claims relating to certain data breaches. These agreements typically limit our liability with respect to indemnification claims other than intellectual property infringement claims. Historically, our costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and, accordingly, we believe the estimated fair value of liabilities under these agreements is immaterial. We warrant that our software products will perform in all material respects in accordance with our standard published specifications during the term of the license. Additionally, we generally warrant that our consulting services will be performed consistent with generally accepted industry standards and, in the case of fixed price services, the agreed-upon specifications. In most cases, liability for these warranties is capped. If necessary, we would provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty claims and claim history; however, we have not incurred significant cost under our product or services warranties. As a result, we believe the estimated fair value of these liabilities is immaterial.

Our Board of Directors is authorized to fix the rights and terms for any series of preferred stock without additional shareholder approval. Common Stock Our Articles of Organization authorize us to issue up to million shares of our common stock. Our Board of Directors had authorized us to repurchase up to billion of our common stock in the period October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2023. We used cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to make such repurchases. All shares of our common stock repurchased were automatically restored to the status of authorized and unissued. We did t repurchase any shares in 2023. In 2022 and 2021 , we repurchased million shares for million and million shares for million, respectively.

The purchase price of the shares on each purchase date is equal to of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock on the first and last trading days of each offering period. The ESPP is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. We estimate the fair value of each purchase right under the ESPP on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and use the straight-line attribution approach to record the expense over the six-month offering period.

The weighted average fair value per share of RSUs granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was , and , respectively. We account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimate expected forfeitures. As of September 30, 2023, total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs expected to vest was approximately million and the weighted average remaining recognition period for unvested RSUs was months. As of September 30, 2023, the weighted average remaining vesting term for outstanding awards is years. As of September 30, 2023, million shares of common stock were available for grant under the equity incentive plan and million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance upon vesting of RSUs granted and outstanding.

The weighted-average fair value of the rTSR RSUs was per target RSU on the grant date. The fair value of the rTSR RSUs was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, a generally accepted statistical technique used to simulate a range of possible future stock prices for PTC and the peer group. The method uses a risk-neutral framework to model future stock price movements based upon the risk-free rate of return, the historical volatility of each entity, and the pairwise correlations of each entity being modeled. The fair value for each simulation is the product of the payout percentage determined by PTC s rTSR rank against the peer group, the projected price of PTC stock, and a discount factor based on the risk-free rate.

Discount rate 

Rate of increase in future compensation 

Rate of return on plan assets 

In selecting the expected long-term rate of return on assets, we considered the current investment portfolio, and the investment return goals in the plans investment policy statements. We, with input from the plans professional investment managers and actuaries, also considered the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide plan benefits. This process included determining expected returns for the various asset classes that comprise the plans target asset allocation. This basis for selecting the long-term asset return assumptions is consistent with the prior year. Using generally accepted diversification techniques, the plans assets, in aggregate and at the individual portfolio level, are invested so that the total portfolio risk exposure and risk-adjusted returns best meet the plans long-term liabilities to employees. Plan asset allocations are reviewed periodically and rebalanced to achieve target allocation among the asset categories when necessary. The discount rate is based on yield curves for highly rated corporate fixed income securities matched against cash flows for each future year. The weighted long-term rate of return assumption, together with the assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations as of September 30, 2023 in the table above, will be used to determine our 2024 net periodic pension cost, which we expect to be approximately million. As of September 30, 2023, the weighted average interest credit rate used in our two cash balance pension plans is .

We periodically review the pension plans investments in the various asset classes . For the CoCreate plans in Germany, assets are actively allocated between equity and fixed income securities to achieve target return. For the other international plans, assets are allocated to fixed income securities. Th e fixed income securities for the other international plans primarily include investments held with insurance companies with fixed returns. The plans investment managers are provided specific guidelines under which they are to invest the assets assigned to them. In general, investment managers are expected to remain fully invested in their asset class with further limitations on risk as related to investments in a single security, portfolio turnover and credit quality. The German CoCreate plan's investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives associated with leverage and speculation or investments in securities issued by PTC, except through index-related strategies and/or commingled funds. An investment committee oversees management of the pension plans assets. Plan assets consist primarily of investments in equity and fixed income securities. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, our actual return (loss) on plan assets was million, million and million, respectively. Based on actuarial valuations and additional voluntary contributions, we contributed million, million and million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to the plans. In 2024, we expect to contribute million to the plans and to directly pay million in benefits.

Fair Value of Plan Assets The international plan assets are comprised primarily of investments in a trust and an insurance company. The underlying investments in the trust are primarily publicly-traded equities and governmental fixed income securities. They are classified as Level 1 because the underlying units of the trust are traded in open public markets. The fair value of the underlying investments in equity securities and fixed income are based upon publicly-traded exchange prices.

6. Covered Retirement . Notwithstanding Section 5, if the Holder s status as an employee of the Company and all Affiliates terminates by reason of a Covered Retirement, all unvested Restricted Stock Units will remain outstanding and continue to vest and be settled on each remaining Vest Date without regard to the requirement that the Holder be employed by the Company and all Affiliates.

The Company and its Affiliates may, to the extent permitted by law, deduct any such tax obligations from any payment of any kind due to the Holder. The Company may, in its discretion, withhold from the Shares delivered to the Holder for any Vest Date such number of Shares as the Company determines is necessary to satisfy the minimum tax obligations required by law to be withheld or paid in connection with the issuance of such Shares, valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of issuance. 

(b) With respect to a Retirement Eligible Individual, the Company may, in its discretion, accelerate the vesting and settlement of a portion of the Restricted Stock Units to the extent necessary to pay the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax imposed under Sections 3101, 3121(a) and 3121(v)(2) of the Code and to pay the income tax at source on wages imposed under Section 3401 of the Code or the corresponding withholding provision of applicable state, local or foreign tax laws as a result of the payment of the FICA tax, and to pay the additional income tax at source on wages attributable to the pyramiding section 3401 wages and taxes; provided that the total payment under this acceleration provision cannot exceed the aggregate of the FICA tax amount, and the income tax withholding related to such FICA amount (as permitted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(vi); and provided further that any RSUs vested and settled in accordance with this Section will reduce, share-for-share, that portion of the Award that would vest on the immediately following Vest Date. 
 
 9. Specified Employee Delay under Section 409A of the Code . The Company shall delay the issuance of any Shares upon any Vest Date to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code (relating to payments made to specified employees as a result of their separation from service) to the date that is six months and one day following the date of the Holder s separation from service (or shorter period ending on the date of the Holder s death following such separation). 

10. Change in Control . In order to preserve Holder s rights under this Award in the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined by the Committee), the Committee in its discretion may at any time take one or more of the following actions: (i) provide for the acceleration of any Vest Date, (ii) provide for payment to the Holder of cash or other property with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount that would have been received with respect to the Shares had the Award fully vested upon the change in control, (iii) adjust the terms of this Award in a manner determined by the Committee to reflect the change in control, (iv) cause the Award to be assumed, or new rights substituted therefor, by another entity, or (v) make such other provision as the Committee may consider equitable to the Holder and in the best interests of the Company. 

11. Securities and Other Laws . It shall be a condition to the Holder s right to receive the Shares hereunder that the Company may, in its discretion, require (a) that the Shares shall have been duly listed, upon official notice of issuance, upon any national securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Company s Common Stock may then be listed or quoted, (b) that either (i) a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 with respect to the Shares shall be in effect, or (ii) in the opinion of counsel for the Company, the proposed issuance and delivery of the Shares to the Holder shall be exempt from registration under that Act and the Holder shall have made such undertakings and agreements with the Company as the Company may reasonably require, and (c) that such other steps, if any, as counsel for the Company shall consider necessary to comply with any law applicable to the issue of such Shares by the Company shall have been taken by the Company or the Holder, or both.

Each employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates is an employee-at-will (that is to say that either the Holder or the Company or any Affiliate may terminate the employment relationship at any time for any reason or no reason at all) unless, and only to the extent, provided in a written employment agreement for a specified term executed by the chief executive officer of the Company or his duly authorized designee or the authorized signatory of any Affiliate. Neither the adoption, maintenance, nor operation of the Plan nor any Award thereunder shall confer upon any employee of the Company or of any Affiliate any right with respect to the continuance of his or her employment by the Company or any such Affiliate nor shall they interfere with the right of the Company (or Affiliate) to terminate any employee at any time or otherwise change the terms of employment, including, without limitation, the right to promote, demote or otherwise re-assign any employee from one position to another within the Company or any Affiliate. 

13. Miscellaneous . The Holder agrees that the obligations imposed on the Holder in this Agreement will apply during Holder s employment with PTC and will survive the termination of Holder s employment. The Holder further agrees that any change in Holder s position, title or responsibilities while employed by PTC will not invalidate or otherwise affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement.

 11. Securities and Other Laws .

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, upon each vesting of a Restricted Stock Unit in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth on the face of this certificate (each, a Vest Date ), the Company shall issue to the Holder one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests on such Vest Date (the Shares as soon as practicable after such Vest Date, but in no event later than March 15 of the following calendar year. 

4. Award and Restricted Stock Units Not Transferable . This Award and the Restricted Stock Units are not transferable by the Holder. 

5. Termination of Employment or Engagement . If the Holder s status as an employee or consultant of the Company and all Affiliates is terminated for any reason (voluntary or involuntary, other than death), all Restricted Stock Units that remain unvested, and, for the avoidance of doubt, all underlying Shares in respect of such Restricted Stock Units, shall immediately and irrevocably terminate and be forfeited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Holder is on military, sick leave or other leave of absence approved by the Company, his or her employment or engagement with the Company (or its Affiliate) will be treated as continuing intact if the period of such leave does not exceed ninety (90) days, or, if longer, so long as the Holder s right to reemployment or the survival of his or her service arrangement with the Company (or its Affiliate) is guaranteed either by statute or by contract; otherwise, the Holder s employment or engagement will be deemed to have terminated on the 91st day of such leave. If the Holder s status as an employee or consultant of the Company and all Affiliates terminates due to such Holder s death, all unvested Restricted Stock Units shall automatically vest as of the date of such Holder s death. 

6. Covered Retirement . Notwithstanding Section 5, if the Holder s status as an employee of the Company and all Affiliates terminates by reason of a Covered Retirement, all unvested Restricted Stock Units will remain outstanding and continue to vest and be settled on each remaining Vest Date without regard to the requirement that the Holder be employed by the Company and all Affiliates. Upon the Holder s death after a Covered Retirement, all then unvested Restricted Stock Units shall automatically vest as of the date of such Holder s death. For purposes hereof, a Covered Retirement is the voluntary termination of a Retirement Eligible Individual who has provided the Company not less than six months prior notice of such employee s intent to retire from the Company or an Affiliate. A Retirement Eligible Individual means an employee of the Company or an Affiliate who is 60 years of age or older and has at least 10 years of credited employment service with the Company and/or all Affiliates. 

7. No Right to Shares or as a Stockholder . The Holder shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the Shares (including voting rights or rights with respect to dividends paid on the Common Stock) issuable under the Award until the Award is settled by issuance of such Shares to the Holder. 

8. Payment of Taxes . (a) The Holder shall pay to the Company, or make provision satisfactory to the Committee for payment of, any taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to the Shares no later than the date of the event creating the tax liability and in any event before any Shares are delivered to the Holder. The Company and its Affiliates may, to the extent permitted by law, deduct any such tax obligations from any payment 

of any kind due to the Holder. The Company may, in its discretion, withhold from the Shares delivered to the Holder for any Vest Date such number of Shares as the Company determines is necessary to satisfy the minimum tax obligations required by law to be withheld or paid in connection with the issuance of such Shares, valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of issuance. 

(b) With respect to a Retirement Eligible Individual, the Company may, in its discretion, accelerate the vesting and settlement of a portion of the Restricted Stock Units to the extent necessary to pay the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax imposed under Sections 3101, 3121(a) and 3121(v)(2) of the Code and to pay the income tax at source on wages imposed under Section 3401 of the Code or the corresponding withholding provision of applicable state, local or foreign tax laws as a result of the payment of the FICA tax, and to pay the additional income tax at source on wages attributable to the pyramiding section 3401 wages and taxes; provided that the total payment under this acceleration provision cannot exceed the aggregate of the FICA tax amount, and the income tax withholding related to such FICA amount (as permitted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(vi); and provided further that any RSUs vested and settled in accordance with this Section will reduce, share-for-share, that portion of the Award that would vest on the immediately following Vest Date. 
 9. Specified Employee Delay under Section 409A of the Code . The Company shall delay the issuance of any Shares upon any Vest Date to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code (relating to payments made to specified employees as a result of their separation from service) to the date that is six months and one day following the date of the Holder s separation from service (or shorter period ending on the date of the Holder s death following such separation). 

10. Change in Control . 

(a) In order to preserve Holder s rights under this Award in the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined by the Committee), the Committee in its discretion may at any time take one or more of the following actions: (i) provide for the acceleration of any Vest Date, (ii) provide for payment to the Holder of cash or other property with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount that would have been received with respect to the Shares had the Award fully vested upon the change in control, (iii) adjust the terms of this Award in a manner determined by the Committee to reflect the change in control, (iv) cause the Award to be assumed, or new rights substituted therefor, by another entity, or (v) make such other provision as the Committee may consider equitable to the Holder and in the best interests of the Company. 
 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any agreement between the Holder and the Company, including any Executive Agreement that provides for certain treatment of outstanding equity in connection with a change in control of the Company, this Section 10(b) rather than the provisions of any such agreement shall control with respect to this Award in the event of a change in control of the Company. In the event of a change in control of the Company: 
 (i) Upon such change in control, (A) any performance criteria applicable to this Award shall be deemed to have been met at the greater of (x) the Target performance level or (y) the estimated achievement level as of the date of the change in control (such greater level, the CIC Level for each of the open performance measurement periods and any RSUs that could have been earned for achievement above the CIC Level shall be automatically cancelled, (B) such CIC Level RSUs shall remain unvested and shall vest in accordance with the vesting schedule; provided that if this Award is not assumed or a cash payment of equivalent value is not substituted therefor (in either case with vesting terms no more restrictive than those of this Award) by any acquirer of or successor to the Company, then this Award shall become vested at the CIC Level upon such change in control, and (C) this Award shall be deemed amended to provide that, notwithstanding any provision of the Plan, this Award may not be terminated or forfeited without the Holder s written consent (provided that this shall not prevent termination (1) of any unvested portion hereof that is terminated or forfeited upon termination of the Holder s employment (other than a change in control termination covered by this Section 10(b)), or (2) upon payment of a cash payment equivalent to the value of this Award at the CIC Level); and 
 (ii) Upon a change in control termination (as such term may be defined in any existing agreement), all unvested CIC Level RSUs shall immediately become vested and distributable in full, and, if such change in control termination would entitle the Holder to a Make-Up Payment (as such term may be defined in any 

existing agreement) with respect to this Award under any existing agreement, then the Holder shall be entitled to such Make-Up Payment with respect to this Award. 
 11. Securities and Other Laws . It shall be a condition to the Holder s right to receive the Shares hereunder that the Company may, in its discretion, require (a) that the Shares shall have been duly listed, upon official notice of issuance, upon any national securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Company s Common Stock may then be listed or quoted, (b) that either (i) a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 with respect to the Shares shall be in effect, or (ii) in the opinion of counsel for the Company, the proposed issuance and delivery of the Shares to the Holder shall be exempt from registration under that Act and the Holder shall have made such undertakings and agreements with the Company as the Company may reasonably require, and (c) that such other steps, if any, as counsel for the Company shall consider necessary to comply with any law applicable to the issue of such Shares by the Company shall have been taken by the Company or the Holder, or both. 

12. No Right to Employment . No person shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award. Each employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates is an employee-at-will (that is to say that either the Holder or the Company or any Affiliate may terminate the employment relationship at any time for any reason or no reason at all) unless, and only to the extent, provided in a written employment agreement for a specified term executed by the chief executive officer of the Company or his or her duly authorized designee or the authorized signatory of any Affiliate. Neither the adoption, maintenance, nor operation of the Plan nor any Award thereunder shall confer upon the Holder or any employee of the Company or of any Affiliate any right with respect to the continuance of his or her employment by the Company or any such Affiliate nor shall they interfere with the right of the Company (or Affiliate) to terminate him or her at any time or otherwise change the terms of employment, including, without limitation, the right to promote, demote or otherwise re-assign him or her from one position to another within the Company or any Affiliate. 

13. Cancellation of Award; Recoupment of Amounts Realized . The Holder agrees that, pursuant to the Company s Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy as in effect on the date of this Award (the Policy ), the Company may (a) cancel this Award and all or any portion of the Restricted Stock Units, (b) reacquire for any or no consideration all or any portion of the Shares following issuance (if such Shares are then held by the Holder or any person to whom the Holder transferred Shares other than for fair market value (a Covered Transferee )), and/or (c) recoup any amounts realized by the Holder and/or any Covered Transferee with respect to the Shares. The Holder agrees that he or she will, promptly upon request by the Company pursuant to the Policy, (x) return to the Company for cancellation any certificate representing the Shares and/or (y) pay to the Company up to the total amount realized by the Holder and/or any Covered Transferee with respect to the Shares, and that the Company and/or any of its affiliates may, to the extent permitted by law, deduct any such amount from any payment of any kind due to the Holder. All determinations by the Committee hereunder shall be final and binding on all interested parties. Any dispute with respect to the terms of this Award or any such recoupment shall be resolved by confidential, binding arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts before the American Arbitration Association, under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. 

14. Effect of Death or Disability . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any agreement between the Holder and the Company, including any Executive Agreement that provides for certain treatment of outstanding equity in connection with the Holder s death or disability, this Section 14 rather than the provisions of any such agreement shall control with respect to this Award in the event of Holder s death or disability. In the event of Holder s death or Disability (as such term may be defined in such an agreement), (i) any performance criteria applicable to this Award shall be deemed to have been met at the Target level for each of the open performance measurement periods and any RSUs that could have been earned in excess of the Target RSUs shall automatically be cancelled, and (ii) all of the unvested Target RSUs shall immediately become vested and distributable in full. 

15. Miscellaneous . The Holder agrees that the obligations imposed on the Holder in this Agreement will apply during Holder s employment with PTC and will survive the termination of Holder s employment. The Holder further agrees that any change in Holder s position, title or responsibilities while employed by PTC will not invalidate or otherwise affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement.

The payments and benefits to which the Executive would otherwise be entitled during the first six (6) months following the Executive s separation from service shall be accumulated and paid or provided, as applicable, in a lump sum, on the date that is six (6) months and one day following the Executive s separation from service (or if such date does not fall on a business day of the Company, the next following business day) and any remaining payments or benefits will be paid in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. 
 (b) 	All in-kind benefits provided and expenses eligible for reimbursement under this Agreement shall be provided by the Company or incurred by the Executive during the time periods set forth in this Agreement. All reimbursements shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable, but in no event shall any reimbursement be paid after the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred. The amount of 
 6 

in-kind benefits provided or reimbursable expenses incurred in one taxable year shall not affect the in-kind benefits to be provided or the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year (except for any lifetime or other aggregate limitation applicable to medical expenses). Such right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 
 (c)	To the extent that any payment or benefit described in this Agreement constitutes non-qualified deferred compensation under Code Section 409A, and to the extent that such payment or benefit is payable upon the Executive s termination of employment, then such payments or benefits shall be payable only upon the Executive s separation from service. The determination of whether and when a separation from service has occurred shall be made in accordance with the presumptions set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A 1(h). 
 (d)	The parties intend that this Agreement will be administered in accordance with Code Section 409A. To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with Code Section 409A, the provision shall be read in such a manner so that all payments hereunder comply with Code Section 409A. Each payment pursuant to this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A 2(b)(2). The parties agree that this Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either party, and as may be necessary to fully comply with Code Section 409A and all related rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either party. 
 (e)	The Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to the Executive or any other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, such Section.	 
 6.	Taxes 
 (a)	 Withholding . All payments to be made to the Executive under this Agreement will be subject to any required withholding of federal, state and local income and employment taxes. In addition, the Company may withhold from any payments hereunder any amounts attributable to withholding taxes applicable to the vesting of or lapse of restrictions on restricted stock or restricted stock units held by the Executive or the exercise of any nonqualified stock options held by the Executive, including, in its discretion withholding from any shares deliverable to the Executive such number of shares as the Company determines is necessary to satisfy such tax obligations, valued at their fair market value (determined pursuant to the respective Company equity compensation plan) as of the date of such vesting or lapse of restrictions. 
 (b)	 Limitations on Payments . 
 		(i)	If it is determined that any payment, benefit or distribution provided for in this Agreement or otherwise (for the purposes of this Section 6(b), each, a Payment and collectively, the Payments from the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (x) constitutes a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (y) but for this subsection (b), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), such Payments shall be either: 
 (A) 	delivered in full, or 
 (B) 	delivered to such lesser extent that would result in no portion of the Payments being subject to the Excise Tax, 
 whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by the Executive on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of Payments, notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payments may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. Unless the Company and Executive otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 6(b)(i) shall be made in writing in good faith by an independent accounting firm selected by the Company, whose determinations shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive (the Accountants ), in good faith consultation with the Executive. 
 7 

(ii)	In the event a reduction in the Payments is required hereunder, the Payments shall be reduced in the following order, in each case, in reverse chronological order beginning with the Payments that are to be paid the furthest in time from consummation of the transaction that is subject to Section 280G of the Code: (1) cash payments not subject to Section 409A of the Code; (2) cash payments subject to Section 409A of the Code; (3) equity-based payments and acceleration; and (4) non-cash forms of benefits; provided that in the case of all the foregoing Payments all amounts or payments that are not subject to calculation under Treas. Reg. 1.280G-1, Q A-24(b) or (c) shall be reduced before any amounts that are subject to calculation under Treas. Reg. 1.280G-1, Q A-24(b) or (c), and Payments that are subject to calculation under Treas. Reg. 1.280G-1, Q A-24(b) but not 1.280G-1, Q A-24(c) shall be reduced before any amounts that are subject to calculation under 1.280G-1, Q A-24(c). 
 (iii)	For purposes of making the determinations and calculations required by this Section 6(b), the Accountants: 
 (A) 	shall take into account the value of any reasonable compensation for services to be rendered by the Executive before or after the Change in Control within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, including without limitation, the Executive s agreeing to refrain from performing services pursuant to a covenant not to compete or similar covenant, whether set forth in this Agreement or otherwise (a Noncompete Covenant ), and the Company shall cooperate in good faith in connection with any such valuations and reasonable compensation positions; and 
 (B) 	may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning the application of taxes and may rely on reasonable good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. 
 		The Company and the Executive shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 6(b). The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 6(b). 
 		(iv)	If the Payments are reduced to avoid the Excise Tax pursuant to Section 6(b)(i) hereof and notwithstanding such reduction, the United States Internal Revenue Service IRS determines that the Executive is liable for the Excise Tax as a result of the receipt of Payments from the Company, then the Executive shall be obligated to pay to the Company (the Repayment Obligation an amount of money equal to the Repayment Amount. The Repayment Amount shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be required to be paid to the Company so that the Executive s net proceeds with respect to the Payments (after taking into account the payment of the Excise Tax imposed on such benefits) shall be maximized. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Repayment Amount shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not eliminate the Excise Tax in accordance with the principles of Section 6(b)(i). If the Excise Tax is not eliminated through the performance of the Repayment Obligation, the Executive shall pay the Excise Tax. The Repayment Obligation shall be discharged within thirty (30) days of either (A) the Executive s entering into a binding agreement with the IRS as to the amount of Excise Tax liability, or (B) a final determination by the IRS or a court decision requiring the Executive to pay the Excise Tax from which no appeal is available or is timely taken. 
 7.	Recovery of Incentive Compensation Received upon Subsequent Restatement 
 Executive understands that Executive is or may become subject to the Company s Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy adopted pursuant to Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act and Nasdaq Rule 5608, or any successor rule (the Clawback Policy ). Executive understands that if Executive is or becomes subject to the Clawback Policy, the Company and/or the Board shall be entitled to recover all Recoverable Compensation (as defined in the Clawback Policy) from Executive pursuant to such means as the Company and/or the Board may elect. Executive understands that such recovery may be sought and occur after Executive s employment with the Company terminates. Executive further agrees that the Executive is not entitled to indemnification for any Recoverable Compensation or for any claim or losses arising out of or in any way related to Recoverable Compensation recovered pursuant to the Clawback Policy and, to the extent any agreement or organizational document purports to provide 
 8 

otherwise, the Executive hereby irrevocably agrees to forego such indemnification. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Executive has received and has had an opportunity to review the Clawback Policy. This Section 7 is a material term of this Agreement. 
 8.	Term

Upon the termination of this Agreement, the respective rights and obligations of the parties shall survive to the extent necessary to carry out the intentions of the parties as embodied herein.

 (B)	continued participation in the Benefit Plans, subject to the terms and conditions of the respective plans and applicable law and the Executive s election of continued coverage under COBRA, for a period of one year following the Termination Date; provided that, to the extent that any of the Benefit Plans does not permit such continuation of the Executive s participation following the Executive s termination or any such Benefit Plan is terminated, the Company shall pay the Executive an amount which is sufficient for the Executive to purchase substantially equivalent benefits, such amount to be paid quarterly in advance; provided, further, however, that to the extent the Executive becomes eligible to receive medical, dental, and/or vision benefits under a plan provided by another employer, the Executive s entitlement to participate in the corresponding Benefit Plan or Plans or to receive such corresponding alternate payments shall cease as of the date the Executive is eligible to participate in such other plan, and the Executive shall promptly notify the Company of the Executive s eligibility under such plan. 
 		(iv)	 No Duplication . Payments and benefits under this Section 3(c) shall be in lieu and without duplication of any amounts or benefits under Section 2, and the Executive shall be entitled to any such payments and benefits for no more than one year even if both such sections apply. If, in the event of a Change in Control Termination under Section 1(e)(iii), the Executive becomes entitled to payments under this Section 3(c) after the Executive has begun to receive payments under Section 2, the Executive shall be entitled to a make-up payment to ensure that the Executive receives the higher amount payable hereunder, with such make-up payment being made within forty-five (45) days following the Change in Control Termination. 
 (d)	 Deemed Amendment of Equity Awards . The Company and the Executive hereby agree that the agreements evidencing any Equity Awards to the Executive are hereby and will be deemed amended to give effect to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this Agreement. 
 4.	Death or Disability; Qualified Retirement 
 (a)	 Death or Disability . Effective upon a termination of the Executive s employment due to Executive s death or by the Company due to the Executive s Disability, except as provided in any Equity Award documentation that explicitly or implicitly excludes such Equity Award from the effects of this section, all performance measures applicable to any Equity Awards held by the Executive shall be deemed to have been met at the Target Level and all Equity Awards held by the Executive shall immediately become vested, unrestricted and exercisable or distributable at the Target Level. 
 (b)	 Qualified Retirement . If Executive s employment terminates due to voluntary resignation after September 30, 2025, all unvested Equity Awards will remain outstanding and continue to vest and be settled on each remaining vest date without regard to the requirement that the Executive be employed by the Company. In the event of the Executive s death after such retirement, all then unvested Equity Awards shall automatically vest as of the date of the Executive s death. 
 5.	Certain Payments to Specified Employees 
 (a)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) at the time of the Executive s separation from service with the Company (in connection with a Change in Control Termination or otherwise), no payment or benefit payable or provided to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement that constitutes an item of deferred compensation under Code Section 409A and becomes payable by reason of the Executive s termination of employment with the Company will be paid or provided to the Executive prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6) month period following the date of the Executive s separation from service (as such term is defined by Code Section 409A and the regulations promulgated thereunder), or (ii) the date of the Executive s death, but only to the extent such delayed commencement is otherwise required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2). The payments and benefits to which the Executive would otherwise be entitled during the first six (6) months following the Executive s separation from service shall be accumulated and paid or provided, as applicable, in a lump sum, on the date that is six (6) months and one day following the Executive s separation from service (or if such date does not fall on a 
 6 

business day of the Company, the next following business day) and any remaining payments or benefits will be paid in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. 
 (b) 	All in-kind benefits provided and expenses eligible for reimbursement under this Agreement shall be provided by the Company or incurred by the Executive during the time periods set forth in this Agreement. All reimbursements shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable, but in no event shall any reimbursement be paid after the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred. The amount of in-kind benefits provided or reimbursable expenses incurred in one taxable year shall not affect the in-kind benefits to be provided or the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year (except for any lifetime or other aggregate limitation applicable to medical expenses). Such right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 
 (c)	To the extent that any payment or benefit described in this Agreement constitutes non-qualified deferred compensation under Code Section 409A, and to the extent that such payment or benefit is payable upon the Executive s termination of employment, then such payments or benefits shall be payable only upon the Executive s separation from service. The determination of whether and when a separation from service has occurred shall be made in accordance with the presumptions set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A 1(h). 
 (d)	The parties intend that this Agreement will be administered in accordance with Code Section 409A. To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with Code Section 409A, the provision shall be read in such a manner so that all payments hereunder comply with Code Section 409A. Each payment pursuant to this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A 2(b)(2). The parties agree that this Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either party, and as may be necessary to fully comply with Code Section 409A and all related rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either party. 
 (e)	The Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to the Executive or any other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, such Section.	 
 6.	Taxes 
 (a)	 Withholding . All payments to be made to the Executive under this Agreement will be subject to any required withholding of federal, state and local income and employment taxes. In addition, the Company may withhold from any payments hereunder any amounts attributable to withholding taxes applicable to the vesting of or lapse of restrictions on restricted stock or restricted stock units held by the Executive or the exercise of any nonqualified stock options held by the Executive, including, in its discretion withholding from any shares deliverable to the Executive such number of shares as the Company determines is necessary to satisfy such tax obligations, valued at their fair market value (determined pursuant to the respective Company equity compensation plan) as of the date of such vesting or lapse of restrictions. 
 (b)	 Limitations on Payments . 
 		(i)	If it is determined that any payment, benefit or distribution provided for in this Agreement or otherwise (for the purposes of this Section 6(b), each, a Payment and collectively, the Payments from the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (x) constitutes a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (y) but for this subsection (b), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), such Payments shall be either: 
 (A) 	delivered in full, or 
 (B) 	delivered to such lesser extent that would result in no portion of the Payments being subject to the Excise Tax, 
 whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by the Executive on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of Payments, 
 7 

notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payments may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. Unless the Company and Executive otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 6(b)(i) shall be made in writing in good faith by an independent accounting firm selected by the Company, whose determinations shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive (the Accountants ), in good faith consultation with the Executive. 
 (ii)	In the event a reduction in the Payments is required hereunder, the Payments shall be reduced in the following order, in each case, in reverse chronological order beginning with the Payments that are to be paid the furthest in time from consummation of the transaction that is subject to Section 280G of the Code: (1) cash payments not subject to Section 409A of the Code; (2) cash payments subject to Section 409A of the Code; (3) equity-based payments and acceleration; and (4) non-cash forms of benefits; provided that in the case of all the foregoing Payments all amounts or payments that are not subject to calculation under Treas. Reg. 1.280G-1, Q A-24(b) or (c) shall be reduced before any amounts that are subject to calculation under Treas. Reg. 1.280G-1, Q A-24(b) or (c), and Payments that are subject to calculation under Treas. Reg. 1.280G-1, Q A-24(b) but not 1.280G-1, Q A-24(c) shall be reduced before any amounts that are subject to calculation under 1.280G-1, Q A-24(c). 
 (iii)	For purposes of making the determinations and calculations required by this Section 6(b), the Accountants: 
 (A) 	shall take into account the value of any reasonable compensation for services to be rendered by the Executive before or after the Change in Control within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, including without limitation, the Executive s agreeing to refrain from performing services pursuant to a covenant not to compete or similar covenant, whether set forth in this Agreement or otherwise (a Noncompete Covenant ), and the Company shall cooperate in good faith in connection with any such valuations and reasonable compensation positions; and 
 (B) 	may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning the application of taxes and may rely on reasonable good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. 
 		The Company and the Executive shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 6(b). The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 6(b). 
 		(iv)	If the Payments are reduced to avoid the Excise Tax pursuant to Section 6(b)(i) hereof and notwithstanding such reduction, the United States Internal Revenue Service IRS determines that the Executive is liable for the Excise Tax as a result of the receipt of Payments from the Company, then the Executive shall be obligated to pay to the Company (the Repayment Obligation an amount of money equal to the Repayment Amount. The Repayment Amount shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be required to be paid to the Company so that the Executive s net proceeds with respect to the Payments (after taking into account the payment of the Excise Tax imposed on such benefits) shall be maximized. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Repayment Amount shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not eliminate the Excise Tax in accordance with the principles of Section 6(b)(i). If the Excise Tax is not eliminated through the performance of the Repayment Obligation, the Executive shall pay the Excise Tax. The Repayment Obligation shall be discharged within thirty (30) days of either (A) the Executive s entering into a binding agreement with the IRS as to the amount of Excise Tax liability, or (B) a final determination by the IRS or a court decision requiring the Executive to pay the Excise Tax from which no appeal is available or is timely taken. 
 7.	Recovery of Incentive Compensation Received upon Subsequent Restatement 
 Executive understands that Executive is or may become subject to the Company s Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy adopted pursuant to Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act and Nasdaq Rule 5608, or any successor rule (the Clawback Policy ). Executive understands that if Executive is or becomes subject to the Clawback Policy, the Company and/or the Board shall be entitled to recover all Recoverable Compensation (as defined 
 8 

in the Clawback Policy) from Executive pursuant to such means as the Company and/or the Board may elect. Executive understands that such recovery may be sought and occur after Executive s employment with the Company terminates. Executive further agrees that the Executive is not entitled to indemnification for any Recoverable Compensation or for any claim or losses arising out of or in any way related to Recoverable Compensation recovered pursuant to the Clawback Policy and, to the extent any agreement or organizational document purports to provide otherwise, the Executive hereby irrevocably agrees to forego such indemnification. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Executive has received and has had an opportunity to review the Clawback Policy. This Section 7 is a material term of this Agreement. 
 8.	Term 
 Unless the Executive s employment is earlier terminated for any reason, this Agreement shall continue in effect until 11:59 p.m. on September 30, 2025 and shall automatically renew thereafter on an annual basis for additional twelve-month terms unless either party provides written notice to the other party of non-renewal at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the then current term. If a Change in Control occurs while this Agreement is in effect, the term of this Agreement shall automatically be extended to the second anniversary of the Change in Control. Upon the termination of this Agreement, the respective rights and obligations of the parties shall survive to the extent necessary to carry out the intentions of the parties as embodied herein, it being expressly agreed that Section 4(b) governing a Qualified Retirement shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 
 9.	Successors and Assigns

 (b)	This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.

As used in this Agreement, Company shall mean the Company as defined above and any successor to or acquirer of its business and/or assets that assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement. 
 10.	No Duty to Mitigate 
 	In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement and, except as contemplated by Sections 2(b) and 3(c)(iii)(B) hereof, any benefits payable to the Executive hereunder shall not be subject to reduction for any compensation received from other employment. 
 11.	Conditions to Payment of Severance 
 	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Executive s entitlement to receive any of the payments and other benefits contemplated by Sections 2, 3 or 4 (with respect to Disability) hereof shall be contingent upon: 
 (a)	execution by the Executive within forty-five (45) days of the Termination Date (or a shorter period as may be determined by the Company) of a general release in substantially the form of Appendix A hereto (such applicable form depending on Executive s location and other legitimate factors as determined by the Company at the time of termination, the Release ), which, if applicable, has not subsequently been revoked, and the Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Company s entering into this Agreement and agreement to make such payments are and shall be good and sufficient consideration for such Release; and
