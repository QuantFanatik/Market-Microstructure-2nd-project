PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. Business 
 We are a global technology leader focused on developing intelligent solutions that allow customers to capture, analyze and act upon data seamlessly from edge to cloud. We enable customers to accelerate business outcomes by driving new business models, creating new customer and employee experiences, and increasing operational efficiency today and into the future. Our customers range from small-and-medium-sized businesses SMBs to large global enterprises and governmental entities. Our legacy dates back to a partnership founded in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard, and we strive every day to uphold and enhance that legacy through our dedication to providing innovative technological solutions to our customers. 
 We use the terms Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HPE, the Company, we, us, and our to refer to Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. 
 Our Strategy 
 Over the last several years, new megatrends around edge, cloud, data, and artificial intelligence AI have emerged to shape customer expectations for enterprise technology. First, data at the edge is increasing exponentially, driven by the proliferation of devices that require secure connectivity to enable reliable digital experiences. Second, enterprises need a cloud experience everywhere to manage data and workloads wherever they live across a distributed enterprise. Third, data growth is creating countless new opportunities to generate meaningful business insights. Finally, HPE is seeing an immense demand shift in AI as customers realize the fundamental potential of the technology to deliver business transformation. Customer response to these megatrends was accelerated by the pandemic and the increasing pace of technological innovation. 
 In concert with these trends, enterprises are consuming their technology differently. Increasingly, customers want to digitally transform while preserving capital and eliminating operating expense by paying only for the information technology IT they use. 
 The megatrends are ushering in long-lasting changes to IT, including accelerating hybrid multi-cloud adoption. Customers across industry verticals are interested in unifying all the applications and data with a consistent cloud experience. 
 Customers also want to better extract value from their growing stores of rapidly evolving data, knowing that actionable insights from data are critical to deliver business transformations. Data is becoming more unstructured, more time-sensitive and more distributed. Frequently, data is siloed and spread across different multi-gen IT systems, often trapped in critical legacy architecture. Many organizations cannot adequately gain insights from their data at the edge or face cloud migration challenges because of their legacy applications. Customers need a data-first modernization approach across edge to data center to cloud. 
 HPE has deployed an edge-to-cloud strategy that capitalizes on emergent megatrends and delivers a data-first modernization approach for customers. Our vision to be the edge-to-cloud company has led us to innovate our solutions across connectivity, cloud, and data. We have shifted our mix of products and services, and how we deliver that mix to customers. HPE has evolved to a platform-based model, fueled by a portfolio richer in software and services. Our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform is a centerpiece of our strategy; it accelerates multi-generation IT transformation through a unified cloud services experience that empowers customers to access, analyze, and extract value from their data across public clouds, data centers, colocation facilities, and at the edge. 
 Our solutions across connectivity, cloud, and data are delivered as-a-service aaS through the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform across our Intelligent Edge, Compute, High Performance Computing Artificial Intelligence HPC AI ), and Storage business segments. Financial Services complements our solution offerings by helping customers unlock financial capacity. 
 We recognize the AI market will be driven by computational capability, data-intensive workloads, and the need for specialized architecture; thus, we are targeting three areas: supercomputing, AI infrastructure, and AI platform software. We believe that we are differentiated from our competition in the ability to capture significant value from the growing AI market through our intellectual property portfolio, trusted expertise, and long-term sustained market leadership in supercomputing.

Human Capital Resources 
 At HPE we are united by our purpose, which is to advance the way people live and work. We believe technology s greatest promise lies in its potential for positive change. This is the guidepost for each decision we make at HPE. We believe it not only helps guide our contribution to society, but also makes good business sense. Our company always strives to be an engine of innovation, and our approximately 62,000 employees as of October 31, 2023, are proud of the ways our technology enables our customers to achieve meaningful outcomes like curing disease, modernizing farming, addressing world-hunger, and democratizing transportation through autonomous vehicles. 
 Our Culture - We recognize the critical importance of talent and culture to the success of HPE and our ability to fulfill our purpose. We are passionate about the values that drive our success, which is why we believe in investing in our team members and in the communities where we live and work. We have identified four key cultural beliefs that guide how we lead on a daily basis: accelerating what s next, bold moves, the power of yes we can, and being a force for good. We embed these beliefs in a deep-rooted DNA that puts customers first, enabling us to partner, innovate, and act with integrity. HPE has remained committed to its focus on internalizing these values into a vibrant culture that creates a superior team member experience and a highly engaged workforce, driving improvements across our communications, our reward programs, our talent/performance programs, and our work environment. Through such efforts, we aim to foster a collaborative, inclusive, and inspiring experience for all our team members and to make HPE a destination for talent while driving high-performance and growth opportunities for our team members, and innovation and excellence for our customers. In the midst of the above, we continually seek feedback from our team members to better understand and improve their experiences and identify opportunities to continually strengthen our culture. Our most recent global engagement survey shows how these intentional efforts are making a difference, with an 86 response rate and our overall Employee Engagement Index, an index designed to capture team member engagement, measuring 83 . More than 84 of those who responded would recommend HPE as a great place to work, and 88 say they are proud to work for HPE. 
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion DEI - We are committed to creating an unconditionally inclusive workplace and to capturing the ideas and perspectives that advance the way we live and work by enabling our workforce, customers, and communities to succeed in the digital age. This is because, by harnessing the potential of our technologies and our team members, we can fuel innovation, drive transformational changes, and be a force for good. Annual aspirational goals are set to drive consistent representation in the recruiting pipeline in line with market availability across all demographics. At the close of fiscal 2023, the representation of worldwide female executives in our workforce had increased 1.9 percentage points since the prior year, with increased representation at every level in worldwide female team members. We also increased our year-over-year representation of underrepresented minorities in the U.S. by 2.3 percentage points overall. We are committed to delivering on our focus on equity, as well, by taking a data-led approach at various points across the team member lifecycle to evaluate and improve our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The DEI index within our annual global engagement survey continued to reveal strong engagement scores across our ethnically diverse team members . The leadership standards clearly articulate that all people leaders are expected to continuously develop their inclusive leadership acumen. Our Board, Chief Executive Officer CEO ), and Executive Committee are expected to, and do in fact, model high standards for DEI and are leading sustainable change through strong governance and oversight. We have also been committed to advancing transparency, by publicly disclosing further information and data on diversity, equity, and inclusion at HPE, including the Equal Employment Opportunity report data, since 2018. 
 Talent - We invest heavily in an effort to attract, develop, and retain the best talent. We are committed to developing team members at all stages of their careers, and we do this by communicating a clear purpose and strategy; setting transparent goals; driving accountability; continuously assessing, developing, and advancing talent; and advancing a leadership-driven talent strategy. The dynamism of our industry and our company enables team members to grow in their current roles and build new skills. Over the past year, our approximately 62,000 team members completed over 820,700 online and instructor-led courses across a broad range of categories leadership; inclusion and diversity; professional skills; technical; and compliance. HPE is deeply committed to identifying and developing the next generation of top-tier leadership with a special focus on diverse and technical talent. We conduct an in-depth annual talent and succession review with our CEO and Executive Committee members. The process focuses on accelerating talent development, strengthening succession pipelines, and advancing diversity representation for our most critical roles. 
 Pay Equity - We believe people should be paid equitably for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. We maintain policies to promote equal pay, and we regularly review our global pay practices with an aim to pay team members in similar roles and locations commensurately with their experience and responsibilities. We partner with independent third-party experts to conduct annual pay assessments and identify unexplained gaps between our present state and our goal of equitable pay treatment for all team members. Where these reviews identify such gaps at a country-wide level, we adjust compensation to eliminate the gap. As a result of our efforts, our most recent pay equity review demonstrated that we have achieved pay parity for base compensation and bonus targets between male and female team

members in the U.S. (including among underrepresented ethnicities), U.K., and India, when accounting for job title, time-in-role, experience, and location. We conduct a number of compensation analyses in other countries to provide competitive and equitable pay and, where permissible, we intend to incorporate similar third-party pay assessments into our existing processes. 
 Work That Fits Your Life - This global initiative, which was launched in 2019, is an important example of how HPE is investing in our culture and creating a team member experience that aims to make HPE a destination of choice for the best talent in the industry. It includes an industry-leading paid parental leave program (minimum 6 months), part-time work opportunities for new parents or team members transitioning to retirement, and Wellness Fridays that allows team members a full Friday off four times per year to focus on their well-being. The HPE Global Wellness Program is a comprehensive program that promotes overall health and well-being by providing team members with programs and resources that offer flexibility built around team member needs while continuing to deliver on critical business results. The program consists of four pillars: physical health, financial well-being, mental and emotional health, and community well-being. Additionally, we offer a hybrid work environment for the majority of our team members, encouraging two days in the office per week for collaboration. 
 Total Rewards - HPE requires a uniquely talented workforce and is committed to providing total rewards that are market-competitive and performance based, designed to drive innovation and operational excellence. Our compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect our commitment to reward short- and long-term performance that aligns with, and drives stockholder value. Total direct compensation is generally positioned within a competitive range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and retain key talent. 
 Board Oversight - Our Board of Directors plays an active role in overseeing our human capital management strategy and programs. Our HR and Compensation Committee provides oversight of our human resources and workforce management programs, including but not limited to those related to corporate culture; compensation plans and policies; diversity and inclusion; and talent acquisition, development, and retention. 
 HPE s strong and healthy culture is critical to accelerating what s next for our customers and partners and the success of our company. We believe that a workforce that is energized and more engaged will fuel our ability to pivot and grow, which will, in turn, power the next chapter at Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

Additionally, certain products and services reported in the financial results for the HPC AI segment through the end of fiscal 2023 will be reported in the Compute and Hybrid Cloud segments, and the recently acquired Athonet business and certain components of our CMS business reported in the financial results for Corporate Investments and Other through the end of fiscal 2023 will be reported in the Intelligent Edge segment. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we will report our results under the realigned six reportable segments. 
 Our Strengths 
 We believe that we possess a number of competitive advantages that distinguish us from our competitors, including: 
 Edge-to-cloud strategy and solutions uniquely solve customer challenges. As data grows and evolves and enterprises become increasingly distributed, HPE s edge-to-cloud strategy is uniquely designed to enable customers to securely access, control, and maximize the value of all their workloads and data assets to accelerate business outcomes. The HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform is an open, secure, fully integrated platform that brings a unified experience across the edge, data center, colocation, and cloud. It is automated and easy to consume with capacity available to scale up and down on demand. It offers true pay per use consumption so customers only pay for what they use, and they can have the entire hybrid cloud experience managed for them through our HPE Managed Services offerings. 
 Comprehensive portfolio. We have a distinctive and industry leading portfolio of edge-to-cloud solutions and capabilities to help accelerate our customers' digital transformations. We combine our software-defined infrastructure and services capabilities to provide what we believe is the strongest portfolio of enterprise solutions in the IT industry. Our ability to deliver a comprehensive IT strategy and connect our customers' data from edge to cloud, through our high-quality products and high-value consulting and support services in a single package, is one of our principal differentiators. 
 Differentiated consumption-based IT solutions for a growing opportunity. Enterprises of all sizes are looking to digitally transform in order to develop next-generation cloud-native applications, create actionable insights from their data, and drive business growth, but they face many challenges including lack of in-house IT skills, limited budgets and options for financing, and lack of flexibility to choose the technology foundation that best meets their needs. Consumption-based IT offers solutions to these challenges by providing greater agility, which empowers people to shift from managing infrastructure to driving innovation by leveraging insights from their data, while also eliminating 
 6

capital and operating expenses tied to infrastructure over-provisioning. HPE is distinctly differentiated in delivering a true consumption-based IT experience. 
 Open platforms. The world is shifting from centralized and closed approaches in large data centers to a future of centers of data everywhere, which are highly decentralized and distributed. This shift demands a unified cloud platform that can put the agility and intelligence close to customers data sources to create real-time insights everywhere. We believe the cloud experience should be open and seamless across all our customers' clouds, rather than requiring customers to be locked into a cloud stack. 
 Multi-year innovation roadmap and strong balance sheet. We have been in the technology and innovation business for over 80 years. Our vast intellectual property portfolio and global research and development capabilities are part of a broader innovation roadmap designed to help organizations take advantage of the expanding amount of data available and leverage the latest technology developments such as cloud, artificial intelligence, supercomputing, and cybersecurity to drive business transformations now and in the future. We also have a strong balance sheet and liquidity profile that provide the financial flexibility and speed to take advantage of acquisition opportunities. 
 Global distribution and partner ecosystem. We are experts in delivering innovative technological solutions to our customers in complex multi-country, multi-vendor, and/or multi-language environments. We have one of the largest go-to-market capabilities in our industry, including a large ecosystem of channel partners, which enables us to market and deliver our product offerings to customers located virtually anywhere in the world. Our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform provides open cloud application programming interfaces to our partners, enabling them to better offer their unique solutions to customers. 
 Custom financial solutions. Through our FS segment, we help customers create investment capacity to accelerate their transformations by helping them free up capital, capture value from older assets, achieve sustainability goals, invest in new technologies as-a-service, and weather financial volatility. FS is also an enabler of our consumption-based IT models by helping spread our upfront solution costs over the duration of the customer contract. Through Financial Services' Technology Renewal Centers, we are helping customers achieve their own sustainability goals by recovering over 3 million IT assets in fiscal 2022 and refurbishing more than 82 for reuse. 
 Experienced leadership team. Our management team has an extensive track record of performance and execution. We are led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Antonio Neri, who has proven experience in developing transformative business models, building global brands, and driving sustained growth and expansion in the technology industry. Mr. Neri's experience includes more than 25 years combined at HPE and Hewlett-Packard Company HP Co. in various leadership positions. Our senior management team has many years of experience in our industry and possesses extensive knowledge of and experience in the enterprise IT business and the markets in which we compete. 
 Sales, Marketing, and Distribution 
 We manage our business and report our financial results based on the segments described above. Our customers are organized by commercial and large enterprise groups, including business and public sector enterprises, and purchases of our products, solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by us or indirectly through a variety of partners, including: 
 resellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to targeted customer groups; 
 distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers; 
 original equipment manufacturers OEMs that integrate our products and services with their own products and services, and sell the integrated solution; 
 independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products; 
 systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom IT solutions and often partner with us to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services; and 
 advisory firms that provide various levels of management and IT consulting, including some systems integration work, and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services. 
 The mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region. We believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales, marketing, and distribution efforts accordingly. We are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage, in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains, in both our direct and indirect businesses. This has resulted in a combined go-to-market model, in which we have a direct sales presence in a number of countries, while we sell and deliver our products, solutions, and services through a channel-only model in the remaining countries. In those countries where we have a direct sales presence, we follow a bifurcated sales operational model with separate go-to-market routes for high-velocity, transactional hardware sales, on the one hand and 
 7 

Table of Content 

for services and solutions, on the other hand. Also, we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers as well as with large public sector accounts. The account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise. For other customers, our businesses collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smaller accounts, both in the commercial and public sector space. 
 Manufacturing and Materials 
 We utilize a significant number of outsourced and contract manufacturers around the world to manufacture products that we design. The use of outsourced and contract manufacturers is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for our products as well as create manufacturing flexibility in our supply chain and processes. In some circumstances, third-party OEMs produce products that we purchase and resell under our brand. In addition to our use of outsourced and contract manufacturers, we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors. 
 Historically, we have utilized two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order. We build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Alternatively, configuring products to order enables units to match a customer's particular hardware and software customization requirements. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers. 
 We purchase materials, supplies, and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available. However, we do rely on single-source suppliers for certain customized parts (although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption) and a disruption or loss of a single-source supplier could delay production of some products. In some instances, our single-source suppliers (e.g., Intel and AMD as suppliers of certain x86 processors) are also the single-source suppliers for the entire market; disruptions with these suppliers would result in industry-wide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors. 
 Like other participants in the IT industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days. From time to time, we experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources due to certain events taking place where our suppliers are geographically concentrated. When necessary, we are often able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market, which may have an impact on our gross margin, but does not generally disrupt production. We also acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints, or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price, and availability of supply. See Risk Factors We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier relationships properly in Item 1A. 
 As a result of the pandemic, worldwide demand for electronic components spiked in many different technology sectors, causing industry-wide shortages for many electronic components. While availability for many components is now recovering, some shortages are nevertheless anticipated to persist, primarily as a result of new demand for certain components arising in more diverse sectors without corresponding capacity investments by suppliers to meet the new demand. We continue to rely on proactive inventory buffering measures in order to position ourselves well for availability of those components. We intend to take additional inventory actions as appropriate in alignment to the market demand, and plan to continue leveraging strong partnerships and long-term agreements with our suppliers. 
 Backlog 
 Backlog represents the price of orders related to current or prior periods for which work has not been performed or goods have not been delivered as of the reporting period. 
 The global pandemic resulted in an unprecedented demand for electronic devices, which, coupled with related industry-wide supply constraints and inflationary pressures, led to a challenging supply chain environment. Additionally, the lasting effects of the pandemic continued to play a role with ongoing delays to the global logistics environment. The elevated order book levels we experienced in fiscal 2022 have generally been declining throughout fiscal 2023, as supply chain constraints eased (though challenges still remain) and demand softened unevenly across our portfolio (as a result of improving supply chain dynamics and as customers have been digesting their prior larger orders). Mild improvements to industry-wide supply constraints have helped to ease certain supply chain challenges we encountered in the recent past, including the increased availability of supply and lower material and logistics costs. Material cost trends are dependent on the strength or weakness of actual end-user demand and supply dynamics, which will continue to evolve and ultimately impact the translation of the cost

environment to our pricing actions and, consequently, our operating results. Logistics costs continued to decrease from previously elevated levels as a result of declines in both expedited shipments and overall rate costs in the freight network. 
 International 
 Our products and services are available worldwide. We believe geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for our customers, draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our operations, provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends, and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products. 
 A summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in Note 2, Segment Information, to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. Approximately 64 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2023 came from sales outside the United States. 
 For a discussion of certain risks attendant to our international operations, see Risk Factors Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes and the laws and regulatory regimes applying to international transactions or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses, and financial condition, and Risk Factors We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in Item 1A of Part I, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk in Item 7A of Part II, and Note 13, Financial Instruments, to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
 Research and Development 
 Innovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success. Our research and development efforts R D are focused on designing and developing products, services, and solutions that anticipate customers' changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends. Our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers' experiences. 
 Expenditures for R D were 2.3 billion in fiscal 2023 and 2.0 billion in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R D expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative, high-quality products, services, and solutions to maintain and enhance our competitive position.

We also continue to invest in our silicon design capability to accelerate the development and delivery of our technology. 
 For a discussion of risks attendant to our R D activities, see Risk Factors If we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy, including our ongoing transition to an aaS consumption-based business model, our business, and financial performance may suffer in Item 1A. 
 Patents 
 Our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. As of October 31, 2023, our worldwide patent portfolio included approximately 13,000 issued and pending patents. 
 Patents generally have a term of up to 20 years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services, enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any of our business segments. 
 In addition to developing our patent portfolio, we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties. 
 For a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see Risk Factors Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend and Our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties in Item 1A. 
 Seasonality 
 From time to time, the markets in which we sell our products, services, and solutions experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months. See Risk Factors Our uneven sales cycle and supply chain disruptions make planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable in Item 1A. 
 Competition 
 We have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise IT infrastructure products, solutions, and services which includes our as-a-service offerings. We encounter strong competition in all areas of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and support, security, and the availability of our IT infrastructure offerings. 
 The markets in which we compete are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms. Most product life cycles are relatively short, and to 
 10 

Table of Content 

remain competitive we must develop new products and services, continuously enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above, among others. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture, and market their products under their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner relationships is critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive. 
 The competitive environments in which our segments operate are described below:

All of these solutions can help customers accelerate digital transformation, create new budget streams, and meet Circular Economy objectives. 
 For a discussion of certain risks attendant to these competitive environments, see Risk Factors We operate in an intensely competitive industry, and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance in Item 1A. 
 Environmental Sustainability 
 Living Progress - Living Progress is our business strategy for creating sustainable IT solutions that meet the technology demands of the future, while advancing the way people live and work. This strategy underpins our commitment to the environmental, social, and governance ESG factors most important to stakeholders. Our edge-to-cloud strategy helps our customers transform and digitize their business while reducing the environmental footprint of HPE and our customers. A legacy of ESG leadership increases our competitiveness and differentiates us in the marketplace by helping our customers achieve not only their business objectives, but also their sustainability goals. The HPE Board of Directors, including through its committees, provides oversight of our ESG strategy, risks, practices, policies, and disclosures, to support integration with our core business strategy. 
 Sustainable Value Creation - Sustainability performance is a core business discipline within HPE. Our Living Progress strategy and sustainability programs are key to our lasting relationships with our customers, and our sustainability credentials

provide us with a competitive advantage in the market, support talent acquisition and retention, and enable ongoing access to global markets. 
 HPE has committed to becoming a net-zero enterprise by 2040, with intermediate targets set across our value chain for 2030. These climate targets are approved by the Science Based Target initiative and align with the latest climate science. Our commitment is supported by our Net-Zero Roadmap, which defines the levers we plan to prioritize to enable us to deliver on our near- and long-term carbon emissions reduction targets and outlines key assumptions with respect to our reduction targets. 
 In 2023, the majority of our greenhouse gas emissions GHG resulted from our customers' use of our products and solutions. We recognize the opportunity to innovate technologies for a carbon-constrained world and are committed to delivering products and services that empower our customers to reduce the carbon footprints of their IT estates while also gaining maximum productivity from their IT investments and reducing costs. For instance, in 2023, HPE launched a portfolio of new and enhanced sustainable IT services to enable IT to run more sustainably from the data center to the workload. 
 To enable market access across the globe and aid customers in selecting more sustainable IT solutions, many of our products are certified by eco-labels such as Electronic Product Environment Assessment Tool, TCO Certified, Energy STAR, China SEPA and the China Energy Conservation Program. 
 Supply Chain Responsibility and Human Rights 
 We manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and improve overall performance and value creation for our customers, partners, and suppliers. Building upon the successful launch of our supply chain data management software, we have granted access to suppliers representing 80 by production spend to visualize their company-specific emissions data and the ability to track progress toward their publicly stated emissions reduction goals. In 2023, we participated in the Responsible Business Alliance pilot of an Environmental Management Tool EMT to request primary GHG emissions data from a small number of our suppliers using third-party software. The EMT enables all suppliers to disclose their GHG emissions, reduction targets, and reporting and verification statuses to their customers in a consolidated, industry-standard survey, increasing ESG transparency, maturity, and data availability. 
 We are conscious of the importance of the responsible use of our products. In an effort to prevent intended and unintended harm, we continue to consider who purchases our offerings and how they are used by, among other things, limiting features, including responsible use clauses, monitoring for risk of alternate end uses, and promoting deployment of AI with safeguards, such as user training and ongoing checks and refinement to mitigate bias and improve accuracy. 
 Our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion extends beyond our workforce and to our suppliers, as well. We believe a diverse supply chain and equity in sourcing not only creates opportunities for underrepresented and underserved communities, but also contributes to the resiliency of our supply chain and of our communities. 
 Human rights principles are embedded in how we do business, and we are committed to holding our entire value chain to high ethical standards that respect such principles. We have processes in place to enable the early detection of forced labor and have implemented due diligence procedures to monitor and help prevent human rights violations or abuses at our suppliers and in our operations. Additionally, through our Responsible Minerals Program, we work to advance the responsible sourcing of minerals used in our products and within our supply chain. 
 We are also committed to the responsible and ethical development and deployment of new technologies to advance how we live and work, and we continue to build on our existing responsible development work, particularly in relation to AI. We have an executive level AI Ethics Responsibility Committee and an operational AI Ethics Working Group, through which we aim to align the development, deployment, and use of AI with HPE's AI Ethical Principles, promoting privacy-enabled and secure, human focused, inclusive, robust, and responsible use of AI. 
 In 2022, we refined our approach to assessing ethical AI and rolled out AI Ethical Principles training. In 2023, we further advanced this initiative by launching three new sub-committees to help us operationalize our principles for: Products (AI we develop), Processes (AI we source to use), and Partnerships (AI we source to incorporate into our solutions). 
 While the HPE Board of Directors and all of its committees take an integrated, rather than siloed, approach to providing oversight of ESG matters, including environmental sustainability, supply chain responsibility, and human rights, our Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee is primarily responsible for oversight of our broader ESG strategy, initiatives, risks, policies, and disclosures. 
 Material Government Regulations 
 Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and our products and services are governed by a number of rules and regulations. Costs and accruals incurred to comply with these governmental regulations are 
 12 

Table of Content 

presently not material to our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future government laws applicable to our operations, services or products will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate material expenditures for government regulations. Nonetheless, as discussed below, we believe that global trade and certain environmental regulations could potentially materially impact our business. 
 Environment 
 Our products and operations are, or may in the future be, subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment, including, among others, laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water; supply chain due diligence, and sustainability, environment and emissions-related reporting; the management, movement, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites; product compliance and safety, such as repairability, chemical composition, packaging and labeling; energy consumption of our products and services; and the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances. We proactively evaluate, and at times replace materials in our products and supply chain, taking into account, among other things, published lists of substances of concern, new and upcoming legal requirements, customer preferences and scientific analysis that indicates a potential impact to human health or the environment. We are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, including servers and networking equipment, subject to certain repairability requirements or financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as product take-back legislation ). We are also subject to standards set by public and private entities related to sustainability issues such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, reusing or recycling. Finally, as climate change and other environmental-related laws, regulations, treaties, and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world, we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions, including fines. In the event our products are impacted by these laws or standards, our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions or from being procured by certain governments or private companies, and we could face other sanctions, including fines. However, we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements, and we are collaborating with industry, business groups and governments to find and promote ways that our technology can be used to address climate change and other environmental-related issues, and to facilitate compliance with related laws, regulations and treaties. We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental and environmental-related laws applicable to our operations, products and services, and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business. We support this commitment with a range of comprehensive policies, including relating to environmental, health and safety, climate, water, and electronic waste; a strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services; an extensive supply chain responsibility program; and an approach to ethical standards and strong governance that are the foundations of our business. 
 Global Trade 
 As a global company, the import and export of our products and services are subject to laws and regulations including international treaties, U.S. export controls and sanctions laws, customs regulations, and local trade rules around the world. Such laws, rules, and regulations may delay the introduction of some of our products or impact our competitiveness through restricting our ability to do business in certain places or with certain entities and individuals, or the need to comply with domestic preference programs, laws concerning transfer and disclosure of sensitive or controlled technology or source code, unique technical standards, localization mandates, and duplicative in-country testing and inspection requirements. The consequences of any failure to comply with domestic and foreign trade regulations could limit our ability to conduct business globally. We continue to support open trade policies that recognize the importance of integrated cross-border supply chains that will continue to contribute to the growth of the global economy and measures that standardize compliance for manufacturers to ensure that products comply with safety and security requirements.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. 
 You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating Hewlett Packard Enterprise and its common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. 
 Business and Operational Risks 
 If we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy, including our ongoing transition to an aaS consumption-based business model, our business, operating results, and financial performance may suffer. 
 Our long-term strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware, software, and services as we deliver global edge-to-cloud platform as-a-service to help customers accelerate outcomes by unlocking value from all of their data, everywhere. We continue our transition to an aaS company, to provide our entire portfolio through a range of subscription and consumption-based, pay-per-use, and aaS offerings. We will also continue to provide our hardware and software in a capital expenditure and license-based model, giving our customers choices in consuming HPE products and services. To successfully execute this strategy and transition, we must continue to improve cost structure, align sales coverage with strategic goals, improve channel execution and strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our strategic capabilities in areas such as edge computing, hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence, data center networking, network security and high-performance compute. We must make sufficient long-term investments in strategic growth areas, such as developing, obtaining, and protecting appropriate intellectual property and committing significant R D and other resources before knowing whether our projections will reasonably reflect customer demand for our solutions. Should such efforts fail to produce actionable insights, or our offerings not perform as designed or promised, we may be unable to manage or complete the transition successfully or in a timely manner, not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transition (even if we complete it), and our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected. Furthermore, such incremental capital requirements may negatively impact cash flows in the near term, and may require us to dedicate additional resources, including sales and marketing costs. 
 The process of improving our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform s aaS solutions and enhancing existing hardware, software, and cloud-based solutions is complex, costly, and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately, to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas, or to otherwise successfully execute this strategy could significantly harm our market share, results of operations, and financial performance. Having developed a cloud platform product in HPE GreenLake, we must be able to continue to scale quickly, while also managing costs and preserving margins, which means accurately forecasting volumes, mixes of products, and configurations that meet customer requirements, which we may not succeed at doing. Our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform faces competition from peer companies with their own cloud platform offerings, and any delay in the development, production, or marketing of a new product, service or solution, including new features of the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, could result in our offerings being late to reach the market, which could further harm our competitive position. Furthermore, we anticipate needing to continually adapt our go-to-market structure with new sales and marketing approaches, to better align with the software consumption-based business model. Changing our go-to-market structure may affect employee compensation models and ultimately our ability to retain employees. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these adjustments in a timely or cost-effective manner, or that we will be able to realize all or any of the expected benefits from them. 
 These solutions generally are multiyear agreements, which result in recurring revenue streams over the term of the arrangement. As customer demand for our software consumption-based offerings increases, we will experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional offerings (for which revenue is generally recognized at the time of delivery) and our aaS offerings (for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement). As such, our financial results and growth depend, in part, on customers continuing to purchase our services and solutions over the contract life on the agreed terms. Additionally, transition to this business model also means that our historical results, especially those from before the transition, may not be indicative of future results, which may adversely affect our ability to accurately forecast our future operating results. Further, these contracts allow customers to take actions, such as requesting rate reductions, reducing the use of our services and solutions or terminating a contract early, which may adversely affect our recurring revenue and profitability. Further, our software consumption offerings could subject us to increased risk of liability related to the provision of services as well as operational, technical, legal or other costs. 
 We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier relationships properly. 
 Our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products, and services, as well as our suppliers abilities to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products, and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services. Given the wide variety of solutions that we 
 17 

Table of Content 

offer, the large and diverse distribution of our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and the long lead times required to manufacture, assemble, and deliver certain solutions, problems have, from time to time in the past, arisen, and could in the future arise, in production, planning, and inventory management that could harm our business. In addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, and resource-intensive than expected. Furthermore, certain of our suppliers have at times decided, and may in the future decide, to discontinue conducting business with us. Other supplier problems that we have faced, and could again face in the future, include component shortages, excess supply, and contractual, relational, and labor risks, each of which is described below. 
 Component shortages . We have been experiencing delays and shortages of certain components as a result of strong demand and capacity constraints caused by insufficient capacity to meet unanticipated demand from emerging markets, and other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers. Though we have seen easing of industry-wide supply constraints, we expect discreet constraints to continue, the duration of which remains uncertain. In the past, we have experienced shortages or delays, which led to higher prices of certain components and exposure to quality issues and delivery delays, which may occur again in the future. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices, of acceptable quality, or at all, to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications. Accordingly, our business and financial performance could suffer from a loss of time-sensitive sales, additional freight costs incurred, or the inability to pass on price increases to our customers. If we cannot adequately address supply issues, we may have to reengineer some product or service offerings, which could result in further costs and delays. 
 Excess supply . In order to secure components for our products or services, at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into long term agreements, non-cancellable commitments, or other inventory management arrangements with vendors. In addition, we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components, which has at times adversely impacted and could in the future adversely impact our business and financial performance. 
 Contractual terms . As a result of binding long-term price or purchase commitments with vendors, we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions. If we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the then-current market price, we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices, our gross margin could suffer, and we could incur charges relating to inventory obsolescence. 
 Contingent workers . We also rely on third-party suppliers for the provision of contingent workers, and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations. We have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future. We may be subject to shortages, oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers. Our ability to manage the size and cost of our contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws. 
 Single-source suppliers . We obtain certain components from single-source suppliers due to technology, availability, price, quality, scale, or customization needs. Certain of such suppliers have, in the past decided, and may in the future decide, to discontinue manufacturing components used in our products, which may cause us to discontinue certain products, incur additional costs to redesign our products so as not to incorporate such discontinued components, or incur time and expense to find replacement suppliers. Replacing a single-source supplier has at times delayed, and could delay, production of some products as replacement suppliers may initially be unable to meet demand or be subject to other output limitations. For some components, such as customized components, alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements. In addition, we sometimes purchase components from single-source suppliers under short-term agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty. The performance of such single-source suppliers under those agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, quantity, and price of our components. The loss of a single-source supplier, the deterioration of our relationship with a single-source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single-source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance. 
 System security risks, data protection incidents, cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or IT services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our stock price. 
 As a leading technology firm, we are exposed to attacks from criminals, nation state actors, malicious insiders, and activist hackers (collectively, malicious parties who have at times been able to circumvent or bypass our cyber security measures. Although some of these attacks have caused disruptions or exposure of information, so far, these attacks have not resulted in material impacts to HPE, nor have any of HPE s consumers, customers, or employees informed HPE that these 
 18 

Table of Content 

attacks resulted in material harm to them. It is possible that future attacks may result in material misappropriation, system disruptions or shutdowns, malicious alteration, or destruction of our confidential or personal information or that of third parties. Further, there has been an increase in the frequency and sophistication of such attacks, and we expect these activities to continue to increase. Malicious parties also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, ransomware, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products, including within our cloud-based environments and offerings. Further, cyber-attacks or incidents have in the past gone, and could in the future go, undetected in our environments for a period of time. Given our broad and diverse network environment, resource limitations, and operational constraints, we have in the past failed, and may in the future fail, to patch certain security vulnerabilities in time to prevent successful disruptions of our infrastructure or expose information. Malicious parties may compromise our manufacturing supply chain and the systems or networks of other third parties on whom we rely, and as such, may embed malicious software or hardware in our products, thereby compromising our customers. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine or Israel and Hamas, may create a heightened risk of such cyberattacks or exacerbate system vulnerabilities, considering our continued hybrid work environment. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs associated with cybersecurity tools and infrastructure and fierce competition for scarce cybersecurity and IT talent have at times limited, and may in the future limit, our ability to efficiently identify, eliminate, or remediate cyber or other security vulnerabilities or problems or enact changes to minimize the attack surface of our network. Furthermore, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. Additional impacts from cybersecurity incidents could include remediation costs to our customers, suppliers, or distributors, such as liability for stolen assets or information, repairs of system damage, and incentives for continued business; lost revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract business partners following an incident; increased insurance premiums; and damage to our competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder value. 
 We manage and store various proprietary information, intellectual property, and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business. In addition, our business may process, store, and transmit customer data, including commercially sensitive and personal data, subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and other privacy laws and regulations related to the handling of personal data. With our business increasingly providing aaS offerings, malicious parties could target such services, potentially resulting in an increased risk of compromise of customer data and regulatory exposure. Incidents involving our cyber or physical security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information, intellectual property, or sensitive, confidential, or personal data about us, our clients, or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information; result in regulatory fines, litigation, and potential liability for us; damage our brand and reputation; or otherwise harm our business. We also could lose existing or potential customers of services or other IT solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of managing an incident and implementing further data protection measures could be significant. 
 Additionally, we have at times experienced, and may experience, other security issues that are not results of any action or attack from malicious parties, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities in our or other parties systems. Portions of our IT infrastructure also have experienced, and may experience, interruptions, delays, or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive, and resource intensive. Furthermore, our data centers depend on predictable and reliable energy and networking capabilities, the cost or availability of which could be adversely affected or disrupted by a variety of factors, including but not limited to the effects of climate change. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins, or lost customers resulting from these events could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, and adversely affect our reputation and stock price. 
 While we seek to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in our products, services, IT systems, controls, and software that could be exploited by any malicious parties, we may not be aware of all such vulnerabilities, and we have at times failed, and may fail, to anticipate, detect, identify, and/or remediate such vulnerabilities before they are exploited. There is no guarantee that a series of issues may not be determined to be material in the aggregate at a future date even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. 
 Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. 
 Our worldwide operations and supply chain could be disrupted by natural or human-induced disasters including, but not limited to, earthquakes; tsunamis; floods; hurricanes, cyclones or typhoons; fires; other extreme weather conditions; power or 
 19 

Table of Content 

water shortages; telecommunications failures; materials scarcity and price volatility; terrorist acts, civil unrest, conflicts or wars; and health epidemics or pandemics. The impacts and frequency of any of the above could be further exacerbated by climate change, particularly in countries where we operate that have limited infrastructure and disaster recovery resources. While we are predominantly self-insured to mitigate the impact of most catastrophic events, the occurrence of business disruptions could, among other impacts, harm our revenue, profitability, and financial condition; adversely affect our competitive position; increase our costs and expenses; make it difficult or impossible to provide our offerings to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers; create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain; or require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. 
 Public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the measures taken in response to such events have in the past negatively impacted, and may again in the future negatively impact, our operations and workforce, as well as those of our partners, customers and suppliers. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of such events have, from time to time, caused increased volatility in financial and other capital markets, adversely impacting our stock price, our ability to access the capital markets, and our ability to fund liquidity needs, and may do so again in the future. The negative impacts of any such events on business operations and demand for our offerings will depend on future developments and actions taken in response to such events, which may be outside our control, highly uncertain, and cannot be predicted at this time. 
 The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including the United States, Puerto Rico, Czech Republic, Mexico, China, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore. We also rely on major logistics hubs, which are strategically located near manufacturing facilities in the major regions and in proximity to HPE s distribution channels and customers. Other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in California and Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. Our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing, logistics, or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including those enumerated above, as they have been in the past by natural disasters and public health issues in the United States, Puerto Rico, and China. To the extent such disruptions adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K. 
 Any failure by us to identify, manage and complete acquisitions and subsequent integrations, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects. 
 As part of our strategy, we may acquire businesses, divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures, and make investments to further our business (collectively, business combination and investment transactions ), and also handle any post-closing issues, such as integration. For example, among other acquisitions and subsequent integrations, in June 2023, we acquired Athonet, a private cellular network technology provider, in May 2023, we acquired OpsRamp, Inc., an IT operations management company, in March 2023, we acquired Axis Security, a cloud security provider, in September 2020, we acquired Silver Peak Systems, Inc., an SD-WAN industry leader and in September 2019, we acquired Cray Inc., a global supercomputer leader. In April 2017 and September 2017, we spun off our Enterprise Services and Software businesses, respectively. See also the risk factors below under the heading Risks Related to Prior Separations. 
 Risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following, any of which could adversely affect our financial results, including our effective tax rate: 
 We may not successfully combine product or service offerings or fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction, which may result in (1) failure to retain employees, customers, distributors, and suppliers; (2) increase in unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations which may cause financial results to differ from expectations; and (3) significant increase in costs and expenses, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, inventory adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans. 
 Our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions, and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence, is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties or their representatives. We may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired company s product quality, financial disclosures, accounting practices or internal control deficiencies or all of the factors necessary to estimate reasonably accurate costs, timing and other matters. 
 In order to complete a business combination and investment transaction, we may issue common stock, potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders or we may enter into financing arrangements, which could affect our liquidity and financial condition. 
 For an acquisition or other combination, the acquisition partner may have differing or inadequate cybersecurity and data protection controls, which could impact our exposure to data security incidents and potentially increase anticipated costs or time to integrate the business. 
 20 

Table of Content 

Business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. 
 For a divestiture, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated. 
 The impact of divestitures on our revenue growth may be larger than projected, as we may experience greater dis-synergies than expected. If we do not satisfy pre-closing conditions and necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms, it may prevent us from completing the transaction. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results. 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult or discourage an acquisition of Hewlett Packard Enterprise if our Board of Directors deems it to be undesirable. Provisions such as indemnification, meeting requirements, and blank check stock authorizations could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests, or changes in control or management of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. 
 Management s attention or other resources may be diverted during business combination and investment transactions and further impacted if we fail to successfully complete or integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives. 
 If we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and financial performance could suffer. 
 We use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world, including both direct and indirect sales to end-users. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability. 
 Our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement. Moreover, some of our wholesale distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic weakness, industry consolidation, and market trends. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution channel partners. Revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we could experience disruptions in distribution, if our distributors financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken. 
 Our inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors. We must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges. Distributors have in the past adjusted orders during periods of product shortages, and may do so in the future, in addition to cancelling orders if their inventory is too high or delaying orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues, and therefore make forecasting more difficult. If we have excess or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory. Moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes. We also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively. 
 In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop, and transition key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us. 
 In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop, and transition qualified executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, development, sales, marketing, and IT support positions. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash and equity-based compensation. These are particularly important considering our recent segment realignment, as we shift our growth strategy to capture the market opportunity presented by hybrid cloud. Certain equity-based incentive awards for certain executives contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our long- 
 21 

Table of Content 

term financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain. If the anticipated value of such equity-based incentive awards does not materialize, if our equity-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity-based incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. 
 Our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations and our ability to execute our strategy. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations. As competition for highly skilled employees in our industry has grown increasingly intense, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, higher than anticipated levels of employee attrition, which has resulted in increased costs to hire new employees with the desired skills and may do so again in the future. In addition, significant or prolonged turnover or revised hiring priorities may negatively impact our operations and culture, as well as our ability to successfully maintain our processes and procedures, including due to the loss of historical, technical, and other expertise. These risks to attracting and retaining the necessary talent may be exacerbated by recent labor constraints and inflationary pressures on employee wages and benefits. 
 Failure to meet ESG expectations or standards or achieve our ESG goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. 
 There has been an increased focus from regulators and stakeholders on ESG matters. Given our commitment to ESG, we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals, commitments, and targets which we may refine or even expand further in the future. These goals, commitments, and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations, are based on available data and estimates, and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Moreover, actions or statements that we may take based on expectations, assumptions, or third-party information that we currently believe to be reasonable may subsequently be determined to be erroneous or be subject to misinterpretation. Initiatives to address such ESG issues may be costly and may not have the desired effect. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts and ability to manage these issues and accomplish our goals, commitments, and targets present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which may be outside of our control or could have adverse impacts on our business, including on our stock price. Further, there is uncertainty around the accounting standards and climate-related disclosures associated with emerging laws and reporting requirements and the related costs to comply with the emerging regulations. 
 Our failure or perceived failure to achieve our ESG goals, maintain ESG practices, or comply with emerging ESG regulations that meet evolving regulatory or stakeholder expectations could harm our reputation, adversely impact our ability to attract and retain customers and talent, and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community and enforcement authorities. Our reputation also may be harmed by the perceptions that our stakeholders have about our action or inaction on certain ESG-related issues, or because they may disagree with our goals and initiatives. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial performance, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. 
 Issues in the development and use of artificial intelligence may result in reputational harm or liability. 
 We currently incorporate AI capabilities into certain of our offerings, and our research into and continued development of such capabilities remain ongoing. As with many innovations, AI presents risks, challenges, and unintended consequences that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by us or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals or society. These deficiencies and other failures of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience competitive, brand, or reputational harm or legal and/or regulatory action. Further, incorporating AI gives rise to litigation risk and risk of non-compliance and unknown cost of compliance, as AI is an emerging technology for which the legal and regulatory landscape is not fully developed (including potential liability for breaching intellectual property or privacy rights or laws). While new AI initiatives, laws, and regulations are emerging and evolving, what they ultimately will look like remains uncertain, and our obligation to comply with them could entail significant costs, negatively affect our business, or entirely limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into our offerings. 
 Additionally, leveraging AI capabilities to potentially improve internal functions and operations presents further risks and challenges. While we aim to use AI ethically and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical or legal issues presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. The use of AI to support business operations carries inherent risks related to data privacy and security, such as intended, unintended, or inadvertent transmission of proprietary or sensitive information, as well as challenges related to implementing and maintaining AI tools, such as developing and maintaining appropriate datasets for such support. Further, dependence on AI without adequate safeguards to make certain

business decisions may introduce additional operational vulnerabilities by impacting our relationships with customers, partners, and suppliers; by producing inaccurate outcomes based on flaws in the underlying data; or other unintended results. 
 Risks arising from climate change and the transition to a lower-carbon economy may impact our business 
 Climate change serves as a risk multiplier that could increase both the frequency and severity of natural disasters that may affect our worldwide business operations and those of suppliers and customers. Our corporate headquarters is located in Spring, Texas, which suffers from floods, hurricanes, and other extreme weather, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, which suffers from drought conditions and catastrophic wildfires, each affecting the health and safety of our employees. In California, to mitigate wildfire risk, electric utilities have, at times periodically deployed, and may in the future, periodically deploy public safety power shutoffs, which affect electricity reliability to our facilities and our communities. Certain sites located in the United States, Middle East, China, and India experience exposure to extreme heat and water stress, which could potentially jeopardize the health and well-being of our employees, consequently impacting our operations. While we seek to mitigate the business risks associated with climate change through site selection, infrastructure technological investments and robust environmental programs, this may require us to incur substantial costs, and we may be unsuccessful in doing so as there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Furthermore, climate change may reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance for these negative impacts of natural disasters by contributing to an increase in the incidence and severity of such natural disasters. 
 The increasing concern over climate change could also result in transition risks, such as shifting customer preferences or compliance risks from changing regulatory and legal requirements. Changing customer preferences may result in increased demands for sustainable solutions, products, and services, which may cause us to incur additional costs, invest more in R D, or make other changes to other operations to respond to such demands, which could adversely affect our financial results. We may also confront higher electricity prices as the grid decarbonizes, and higher costs for supplies or components that comply with certain environmental regulatory thresholds, potentially impacting our margins or the pricing of our offerings. If we fail to manage these and other transition risks in an effective manner, customer demand for our solutions, products, and services could diminish, and our profitability could suffer. 
 If we cannot continue to produce quality products and services, our reputation, business, and financial performance may suffer. 
 In the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products, services, and solutions, including defects in our engineering, design, and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by third-party contractors or subcontractors or their employees. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions. However, the products, services, and solutions that we offer are complex, and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors, particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties. If we are unable to determine the cause, find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix (or patch to address quality issues with our products, we may delay shipment to customers, which could delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, and profitability. In addition, after products are delivered, quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products. Addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, repair, replacement, and other costs, adversely affecting our financial performance. If new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions, our results of operations could be adversely affected, and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers' expectations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Industry Risks 
 We operate in an intensely competitive industry, and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance. 
 Our ability to implement solutions for our customers, anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology (such as cloud-, AI-, and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving), and develop new service offerings or incorporate technological improvements into our offerings that meet current and prospective customers needs, as well as evolving industry standards, is critical to our competitiveness and success. We encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business, and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments. We compete primarily on the basis of our technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, portfolio of products, ease of use, account relationships, customer training, service and support, and security of our offerings. If our products, services, support, and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria, our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed. 
 23 

Table of Content 

We have a large portfolio of products and services and must allocate our financial, personnel, and other resources across all of our products and services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product or service lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do, and our competitors may have greater financial, technical, and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against theirs. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technologies, successfully adapt to industry developments and changing demand, and evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale to keep pace with the demands of the markets we serve, we may be unable to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and execute on our growth strategy, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous, and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate. Additionally, our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers. 
 Companies with whom we have vertical relationships in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other areas. In addition, companies with whom we have vertical relationships also may acquire or form relationships with our competitors, which could reduce their business with us. If we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with vertical partners, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 We face aggressive price competition and may continue to do so. As a consequence of inflation and higher supply chain and manufacturing costs, we have in the past increased the prices of many of our products and services to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin, and may do so again in the future. In addition, competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lower-cost markets in which we compete, or who can obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer. Our cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures. 
 Because our business model is based on providing innovative and high-quality products and services, we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on R D than some of our competitors. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure (apart from R D expenses) on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our profitability could be adversely affected. In addition, if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions, we may lose market share in certain areas, which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects. 
 Even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete. For example, our Storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards software defined and public cloud, which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products. Financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products. 
 International Risks 
 Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes and the laws and regulatory regimes applying to international transactions or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses, and financial condition. 
 Our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware, software, and services in, and continued access to, the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness and uncertainty and constrained spending on network and enterprise infrastructure have in the past adversely affected the demand for our products, services, and solutions. These have resulted in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges, and made it more difficult for us to manage inventory and make accurate forecasts of revenue, gross margin, cash flows, and expenses, and may have such effects again in the future. Such factors, including how long such conditions may persist, among others, may negatively impact the evenness or volume of demand for our products and services, potentially resulting in impacts similar to those mentioned above, though the precise extent of such impacts cannot be accurately predicted. 
 Economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations. Any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets, or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations, as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption. Interest and other expenses have varied, and could continue to vary, materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates, borrowing costs, currency exchange rates, costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments. For example, in response to increasing inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve, along with central banks around the world, have been raising interest rates, signaled expectations of additional rate increases, and have indicated these rates may remain higher for longer. It is difficult to predict the impact of such events on us, our third-party partners, our customers, or economic markets more broadly, which have been and will continue to be highly dependent upon the actions of governments and businesses in response to macroeconomic events, and the effectiveness of those actions. Such 
 24 

Table of Content 

actions have impacted, and may further impact our ability, desire, or the timing of seeking funding for various investment opportunities. Economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses. Further, reduced U.S. federal government spending may limit demand for our products, services, and solutions from organizations that receive funding from the U.S. government, and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the United States, which could further reduce demand for our products, services, and solutions. 
 Our business and financial performance also could be adversely affected by changes in U.S. trade policy, U.S. export controls and sanctions, and U.S. regulations concerning imports, as well as international laws and regulations relating to global trade. Current U.S. government trade policy includes the imposition of tariffs on certain foreign goods, including information and communication technology products. These measures have materially increased costs for certain goods imported into the United States. As a result, our business has in the past been impacted by forced material price increases, which in turn resulted in price increases for our offerings, which subsequently limited demand or reduced margins for our offerings, all of which may impact us again from time to time in the future. Additionally, U.S. trading partners may adopt their own trade policies making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. Similarly, changes in regulations relating to exports could prevent us from exporting products to certain locations or customers entirely. In addition, changes in requirements relating to making foreign direct investments could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets, affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components, increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions. 
 Sales outside the United States constituted approximately 64 of our net revenue in fiscal 2023. As such, our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors in addition to those otherwise already disclosed, including: 
 ongoing uncertainties as a result of instability or changes in geopolitical conditions, including military or political conflicts, such as those caused by the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine or Israel and Hamas (the potential escalation or geographic expansion of which could heighten other risks identified in this report), or the relationship between China and the U.S. (which could, among other things, impact the enforceability of certain contracts or the timing and form of certain payments); 
 inflationary pressures, such as those the market is currently experiencing, which have increased, and may continue to increase, costs for materials, supplies, and services; 
 adverse or uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including a rising interest rate environment and fears of a potential global economic downturn or recession, which have at times in the past slowed customer demand for our products and services, and may do so again in the future; 
 network security, privacy, and data sovereignty concerns, which could make foreign customers reluctant to purchase products and services from U.S.-based technology companies; 
 longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers, which could impact our ability to collect on accounts receivable and consequently recognize revenue; 
 local labor conditions and regulations, including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and OEMs, or changes to immigration and labor law policies which may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent; 
 managing our geographically dispersed workforce, which has necessitated, and may in the future require, incurring costs to promote seamless workforce connectivity and to comply with changing laws, regulations and workers rights councils across multiple jurisdictions; 
 differing technology standards or customer requirements, which have required us to incur additional development and production costs to modify or adapt our offerings, and may do so again in the future; 
 local content and manufacturing requirements, which have impacted, and could further impact, our ability to sell into those markets; 
 difficulties associated with repatriating earnings in restricted countries, and changes in tax laws, which introduces uncertainty to our results of operations and financial performance; and 
 fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments, which have from time to time adversely impacted, and any of which could in the future adversely impact, our results of operations and ability to meet customer demand. 
 Certain of the factors described above have, in the past, disrupted the operations of, and adversely impacted our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers, customers, or vendors located outside of the United States, and could do so again in the future. For example, we rely on suppliers in Asia for product assembly and manufacture, the operations of whom are subject to local labor laws and other requirements. Any loss of or limitations on their output or their inability to operate 
 25 

Table of Content 

could have an adverse effect on our ability to timely deliver our products and services, which would in turn negatively impact our financial performance. 
 Further, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the trade sanctions imposed by the U.S., the European Union (the EU ), and other countries in response have negatively impacted business and financial performance in that region. HPE is proceeding with the exit of our remaining business in Russia and Belarus as planned; however, we cannot provide any assurance that such exit will be efficient or uninterrupted, which may negatively impact our operational expenses. 
 We implement policies, procedures, and training designed to facilitate compliance with anti-corruption laws around the world, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. But in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, people may engage in business practices prohibited by anti-corruption laws. Our employees and third parties we work with may take actions in violation of our policies, and those actions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. 
 We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the Japanese yen, and British pound have, from time to time, adversely impacted, and could in the future, have an adverse impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have, from time to time, adversely affected, and could in future periods adversely affect our revenue recognition and our revenue growth. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect our ability to implement price increases, margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the United States. 
 From time to time, we use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks, and may continue to do so in the future. The effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. We may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as volatility and currency variations. In addition, certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective, may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition. 
 Intellectual Property Risks 
 Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license, or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend. 
 We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws in the United States, similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers, and other parties, to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell, provide, or otherwise use in our operations. However, from time to time our intellectual property rights have been challenged, infringed, or circumvented, and any of such rights could be further challenged, invalidated, infringed, or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use; this, too, could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position. 
 Our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties. 
 Much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties. For example, many of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties, including through both proprietary and open source licenses. These third-party software components may become obsolete, defective, or incompatible with future versions of our products, our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or cease, or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated. We may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships. In order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must carefully monitor and manage our use of third-party software components, including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms. Additionally, some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive. Our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business, including our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition, third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction. Because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all, or 
 26 

Table of Content 

refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights. 
 Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, including patent infringement, are commonplace in our industry and successful third-party claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services. 
 Third parties may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights. Patent assertion entities frequently purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of extracting infringement settlements. If we cannot license, or replace, allegedly infringed intellectual property on reasonable terms, our operations could be adversely affected. Even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against and may divert management's attention and resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, discontinue certain product offerings, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing, marketing, or selling certain of our products. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us. 
 Financial Risks 
 Adverse developments affecting our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs, and access to capital markets could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody's Investors Service, Standard Poor's Ratings Services, and Fitch Ratings Services. Despite these investment grade credit ratings, any future downgrades could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper, or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts. Additionally, increased borrowing costs, including those arising from a credit rating downgrade, can potentially reduce the competitiveness of our financing business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position, and access to capital markets. 
 In addition, volatility and disruption in the financial sector and capital markets and other events negatively affecting macroeconomic conditions or contributing to the instability or volatility thereof, such as rising interest rates, have from time to time in the past impacted, and may in the future impact, our liquidity, capital position, and access to capital markets. Our total liquidity depends in part on the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility and our other financing agreements. The failure of any lender's ability to fund future draws on our revolving credit facility or our other financing arrangements could reduce the amount of cash we have available for operations and additional capital for future needs. The future effects of such events are unknown and difficult to predict at this time, and could adversely affect us, our customers, financial institutions, transactional counterparties, or others with which we do business, which may in turn have adverse impacts on our current and/or projected business operations, financial condition, and our results of operations. 
 Our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends. 
 In addition to our current total carrying debt, we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. This collective amount of debt could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors, including requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments; making it more difficult to satisfy other obligations; increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; reducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase our common stock. 
 Recent quantitative tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve, along with other central banks around the world, have affected, and may continue to affect, our short-term ability to incur debt at reasonable prices, or our desire to incur debt at all. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay our outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service or refinance our debt. 
 The revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future financial results less predictable. 
 Our revenue, gross margin, and profit vary among our diverse products and services, customer groups, and geographic markets and therefore, will likely be different in future periods than our historical results. Our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services, which is difficult to accurately predict, varies from time to time, and may be uneven 
 27 

Table of Content 

across our portfolio of offerings. Additionally, customer acceptances of delivered orders and the timing thereof can be uneven across our portfolio and can impact our ability to recognize revenue. Such variables have in the past negatively impacted our financial performance, and may do so again in the future. Delays or reductions in IT spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services, which could result in a significant decline in revenue. In addition, revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose cross-selling opportunities. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product, service, customer, and geographic mix reflected in that period's net revenue. 
 Furthermore, the relationship between China and the U.S., and any subsequent action that may be taken by either country, may significantly vary the results our operations and financial performance from that region. There could be additional uncertainty surrounding the enforceability of contract obligations, as well as the timing and form of payments from China. 
 Competition, lawsuits, investigations, increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers, component supply disruptions, and other risks affecting our businesses may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability. Variations in our fixed cost structure and gross margins across business units and product portfolios, have from time to time led to, and may lead to significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. In addition, newer geographic market opportunities may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures, and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. Market trends, industry shifts, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs, regulatory impacts, and other factors have from time to time resulted in, and may in the future result in, reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period, which may lead to adjustments to our operations. Moreover, our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period. 
 Our uneven sales cycle and supply chain disruptions make planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable. 
 In some of our businesses, our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter's total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations, and working capital for each financial period difficult, increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition, and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, there may be excess inventory; and alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled, all of which we experienced from time to time in the past and may do so again in the future. Depending on when they occur in a quarter, developments such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages, or global logistics disruptions, have in the past adversely impacted, and could in the future adversely impact, our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also have produced, and may in the future produce, variations in our quarterly results and financial condition. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control. 
 Separately, periodic supply chain shortages and constraints have, in some instances, resulted in, and may result in, increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we have, at times, not been able to, and may, in the future, not be able to pass on to our customers. We have, in some instances, responded to such constraints by committing to higher inventory purchases and balances relative to our historical positions in order to secure manufacturing capacity. While these measures have been taken to shorten lead times to deliver products to customers, they may also result in excess or obsolete components in the future if the demand for our products is less than we anticipate, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. 
 We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 In connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In addition, as discussed in Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates and Note 17, Litigation and Contingencies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Regulatory and Government Risks

Our business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations. Laws and regulations may change in ways that will require us to modify our business model and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. For example, as a result of laws and regulations concerning the environment, we face increasing complexity related to product design, safety and compliance; the use of regulated, hazardous, and scarce materials; the management, movement and disposal of hazardous substances and waste; the associated energy consumption and efficiency related to operations and the use of products, services, and solutions; the discharge of pollutants into the air and water; the transportation and shipping of products and other materials; supply chain due diligence, and climate change, emissions and sustainability-related regulations and reporting requirements; the use of AI capabilities in our offerings; and the reuse, recycling and/or disposal of products and their components at end-of-use or useful life and associated operational or financial responsibility, as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to our transition to a more circular economy. A significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Any changes to current environmental legal requirements, such as the EU's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the EU's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, China's Administrative Measure on the Control of Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, the EU's Ecodesign Directive and product-specific implementing measures (including Lot 9 on servers and online data storage products), the evolving EU and US right to repair legal landscape, and India's regulation on e-waste collection and recycling, among others, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU, U.S., China, India and/or other countries proposing or adopting similar environmental legal requirements. In addition, other ESG-related laws, regulations, treaties, and similar initiatives and programs are being proposed, adopted, and implemented throughout the world (including, but not limited to the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the EU Taxonomy, and the proposed EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive). If we were to violate or become liable under environmental or certain ESG-related laws or if our products become non-compliant with such laws or market access requirements, it could result in loss of market access or limit offerings in those markets or our customers may refuse to purchase our products, and we could incur costs or face other sanctions, such as restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions, fines, and/or civil or criminal sanctions. Environmental regulations may also impact the availability and cost of energy or emissions related to energy consumption which may increase our cost of manufacturing and/or the cost of powering and cooling owned IT infrastructures. 
 In addition, our business is subject to an ever-growing number of laws addressing privacy and information security. In particular, we face an increasingly complex regulatory environment as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the security of our offerings. The increase in aaS offerings may also be impacted by data localization and international data transfer requirements under various privacy laws, including those arising from the Schrems II ruling in Europe. If we were to violate or become liable under laws or regulations associated with privacy or security, we could incur substantial costs or be exposed to potential regulatory fines, civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims, and reputational damage. 
 Jurisdictions in which we have significant operations and assets, such as the U.S., China, India, and the E.U., each have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies including, but not limited to fair competition, tax practices, anti-corruption, anti-trust, price controls and international trade, which have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition. 
 Contracts with federal, state, provincial, and local governments are subject to a number of challenges and risks that may adversely impact our business. 
 Our contracts with federal, state, provincial, and local governmental customers are subject to various government procurement laws and regulations, required contract provisions, and other requirements relating to contract formation, administration, and performance, as well as local content, manufacturing, and security requirements. Any violation of government contracting laws and regulations or contract terms could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and fines, treble damages, and suspension from future government contracting. Such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business. In addition, we will continue to be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts. If we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new government contracts is adversely affected, our financial performance could suffer. 
 Government contracts impose additional challenges and risks to our sales efforts. Government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including in connection with an extended federal government shutdown, with funding reductions, or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services. Such developments could result in material payment delays, payment reductions, or contract terminations by our governmental customers, which in turn may adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition of government contractors with whom we conduct business. This may cause those government contractors to become unable to meet their obligations under contracts with us.

Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance. 
 We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding, and other items. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional taxes as a result. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. 
 The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 . In December 2022, the EU member states adopted a directive that implements the Pillar Two framework, which is expected to be enacted into the national laws of the EU member states by December 31, 2023. Certain countries in which we operate have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar Two framework (e.g., United Kingdom and Korea), and several other countries are also considering changes to their tax laws to implement this framework. The first component of the Pillar Two framework is expected to be effective for us in fiscal 2025 with a second component expected to be effective in fiscal 2026. When and how this framework is adopted or enacted by the various countries in which we do business could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Inflation Reduction Act into law, which includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (the Corporate AMT ), beginning in fiscal 2024, of 15 on the adjusted financial statement income AFSI of corporations with average AFSI exceeding 1.0 billion over a three-year period. We expect U.S. cash tax to increase in the short term as a result of the Corporate AMT but do not expect the effective tax rate to be impacted as the Corporate AMT is expected to be recovered as a credit in future years. 
 During fiscal 2019, we executed a Termination and Mutual Release Agreement which terminated our Tax Matters Agreement with HP Inc. Because we now have limited indemnity rights from HP Inc., we potentially bear more economic risk for certain potential unfavorable tax assessments. 
 Risks Related to Prior Separations 
 The stock distribution in either or both of the completed separations of our former Enterprise Services business and our former Software segment could result in significant tax liability, and DXC Technology Company or Micro Focus International plc (as applicable) may in certain cases be obligated to indemnify us for any such tax liability imposed on us. 
 The completed separations and mergers of our former Enterprise Services business with DXC Technology Company DXC (the Everett Transaction or Everett and our Software Segment with Micro Focus International plc Micro Focus (the Seattle Transaction or Seattle were conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from outside counsel regarding the qualification of (i) the relevant distribution and related transactions as a reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a), 361 and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code and (ii) the relevant merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. While the Seattle Transaction generally qualified for tax-free treatment for us, Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, the acquisition of Seattle SpinCo by Micro Focus resulted in the recognition of gain (but not loss) for U.S. persons who received Micro Focus American Depositary Shares in the Software separation. 
 Each opinion of outside counsel was based upon and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of us, Everett SpinCo and CSC, or us, Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, as applicable. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the relevant separation documents, the relevant opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. Notwithstanding the opinions of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS could determine that either or both of the distributions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings upon which the relevant opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated, or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert a contrary position. 
 If the distribution of Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of 
 30 

Table of Content 

the Code, in general, we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the stock of Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable, in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our stockholders who receive Everett SpinCo shares or Seattle SpinCo shares in the relevant distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares. 
 We obtained private letter rulings from the IRS regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the separation of our Enterprise Services business and Software Segment. Those rulings concluded that certain transactions in those separations are generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The conclusions of the IRS private letter rulings were based, among other things, on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to the IRS. If any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, the validity of the IRS private letter rulings may be affected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the completed separation of our former Enterprise Services business and Software Segment, including non-U.S. tax expenses resulting from the completed separation of our former Enterprise Services business and Software Segment in multiple non-U.S. jurisdictions that do not legally provide for tax-free separations, which may be material. If the completed separation of our former Enterprise Services business or Software Segment (including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of those separations) are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and/or DXC and/or Micro Focus could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. 
 Under the tax matters agreements entered into by us with Everett SpinCo and CSC, and with Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, Everett SpinCo and Seattle SpinCo generally would be required to indemnify us for any taxes resulting from the relevant separation (and any related costs and other damages) to the extent such amounts resulted from (i) certain actions taken by, or acquisitions of capital stock of, Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable (excluding actions required by the documents governing the relevant separation), or (ii) any breach of certain representations and covenants made by Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable. Any such indemnity obligations could be material. 
 We continue to face a number of risks related to our separation from HP Inc., our former parent, including those associated with ongoing indemnification obligations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and shared use of certain intellectual property rights, which could in the future adversely impact our reputation. 
 In connection with our separation from HP Inc. on November 1, 2015 (the Separation ), Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. entered into several agreements that determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the Separation and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. In these agreements, HP Inc. agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify HP Inc. for certain liabilities, including cross-indemnities that are designed and intended to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us, and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of HP Inc.'s business with HP Inc. We may be obligated to fully indemnify HP Inc. for certain liabilities under the Separation agreements or HP Inc. may not be able to fully cover their indemnification obligations to us under the same Separation agreements. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 In addition, the terms of the Separation also include licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the operations of both businesses. For example, through a joint brand holding structure, both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy Hewlett-Packard and HP branding, respectively. As a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of HP Inc. could also adversely affect our reputation. 
 General Risks 
 Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict. 
 Investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Our stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile and can be affected by, among other things, speculation, coverage, or sentiment in the media or the investment community; the announcement of new, planned or contemplated products, services, technological innovations, acquisitions, divestitures, or other significant transactions by us or our competitors; developments in our transformation programs or in our transition to an as-a-service business model; our quarterly financial results and comparisons to estimates by the investment community or financial outlook provided by us; the financial results and business strategies of our competitors; inflation; market volatility or downturns caused by outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, geopolitical tensions or conflicts, or other macroeconomic dynamics; developments relating to pending investigations, claims, and disputes; or the timing and amount of our share repurchases. General or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may affect the price of our stock. Volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.

ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 For purposes of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A section, we use the terms Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HPE, the Company, we, us, and our to refer to Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. 
 This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Discussions of fiscal 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year October 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on December 8, 2022, which is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. 
 We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist the reader in understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements, changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. 
 This MD A is organized as follows: 
 Trends and Uncertainties. A discussion of material events and uncertainties known to management, such as the mixed macroeconomic environment, supply chain constraints (though easing), uneven demand across our portfolio, increased demand for and adoption of new technologies, conservative customer spending environment, inflationary trend and foreign exchange pressures, and recent tax developments. 
 Executive Overview. A discussion of our business and a summary of our financial performance and other highlights, including non-GAAP financial measures, affecting the Company in order to provide context to the remainder of the MD A. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. A discussion of accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. 
 Results of Operations. A discussion of the results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a discussion of the results of operations at the segment level. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources. An analysis and discussion of changes in our cash flows, financial condition, liquidity, and cash requirements and commitments. 
 GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation . Each non-GAAP financial measure has been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This section also includes a discussion of the use, usefulness and economic substance of the non-GAAP financial measures, along with a discussion of material limitations, and compensation for those limitations, associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. 
 
 TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
 The elevated order book levels we experienced in fiscal 2022 have generally declined throughout fiscal 2023, as supply chain constraints eased (though challenges still remain) and demand softened unevenly across our portfolio (as a result of improving supply chain dynamics and as customers have been digesting their prior larger orders). Meanwhile, demand for and adoption of new technologies, such as AI, hybrid cloud, and edge computing, have increased. We have observed, and expect to continue seeing, customers of various segments and sizes pursue such new technologies. As noted above, we have continued to see elongated sales cycles, as customers work through prior orders and adopt a more conservative approach to spending in a mixed macroeconomic environment. This has been particularly true of certain of our hardware businesses, as customers have focused investments on modernizing infrastructure, such as migrating to cloud-based offerings. We expect such mixed macroeconomic environment to continue to moderate our revenue growth in the near term. 
 As referenced above, mild improvements to industry-wide supply constraints have helped to ease certain supply chain challenges we encountered in the recent past, including the increased availability of supply and lower material and logistics costs. Material cost trends are dependent on the strength or weakness of actual end-user demand and supply dynamics, which will continue to evolve and ultimately impact the translation of the cost environment to our pricing actions and, consequently, our operating results. Logistics costs continued to decrease from previously elevated levels as a result of declines in both expedited shipments and overall rate costs in the freight network.

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

Additionally, we continue to experience a challenging foreign exchange environment, which has increased costs of products and services and moderated our revenue and earnings growth. We have a large global presence, with more than half of our revenue generated outside of the U.S. As a result, our financial results can be, and particularly in recent periods have been, impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Furthermore, inflationary pressures persist, keeping not only material and logistics costs, but also labor costs, somewhat elevated compared to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. We expect the unfavorable foreign exchange effects and inflationary trend to continue in the longer term. 
 Recent Tax Developments 
 The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 . In December 2022, the EU member states adopted a directive that implements the Pillar Two framework, which is expected to be enacted into the national laws of the EU member states by December 31, 2023. Certain countries in which we operate have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar Two framework (e.g., United Kingdom and Korea), and several other countries are also considering changes to their tax laws to implement this framework. The first component of the Pillar Two framework is expected to be effective for us in fiscal 2025 with a second component expected to be effective in fiscal 2026. When and how this framework is adopted or enacted by the various countries in which we do business could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
 On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Inflation Reduction Act into law. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (the Corporate AMT of 15 on the adjusted financial statement income AFSI of corporations with average AFSI exceeding 1.0 billion over a three-year period. The Corporate AMT is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2024. We expect U.S. cash tax to increase in the short term as a result of the Corporate AMT but do not expect the effective tax rate to be impacted as the Corporate AMT is expected to be recovered as a credit in future years. The realizability of any deferred tax asset associated with the Corporate AMT will be determined through our annual valuation allowance analysis. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act imposes an excise tax of 1 tax on the fair market value of net stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The impact of this provision will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods. 
 The Internal Revenue Service IRS is conducting audits of our fiscal 2017 through 2022 U.S. federal income tax returns. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the IRS issued notices of proposed adjustments NOPAs for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 relating to our intercompany transfer pricing. After the close of fiscal 2023, the IRS issued a Revenue Agent Report RAR finalizing their position on the NOPAs for the same issues and same fiscal years. The IRS is seeking to increase taxable income across the three fiscal years by 904 million. As of the balance sheet date, we have sufficient tax credit carryforwards to offset any incremental tax liability from the adjustments in the RAR. However, we disagree with the IRS adjustments and believe the positions taken on our tax returns are more likely than not to prevail on technical merits, and we will defend these positions through the IRS administrative processes, as necessary. Accordingly, no changes have been made to our reserves for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2023 relating to the IRS adjustments. 
 Russia/Ukraine Conflict 
 The conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed by the U.S., European Union and other countries in response have negatively impacted our operations in both countries and increased economic and political uncertainty across the world. In response to the sanctions imposed, in February 2022, we suspended all new sales and shipments to Russia and Belarus and implemented compliance measures to address the continuously changing regulatory landscape. Based on a further assessment of business risks and needs, in June 2022, we determined that it was no longer tenable to maintain our operations in Russia and Belarus and have been proceeding with an orderly, managed exit of our remaining business in these countries. 
 Other Trends and Uncertainties 
 We have observed market trends and demand gravitating towards AI, hybrid cloud, and edge computing, and data securities capabilities, and offerings. The volume of data at the edge continues to grow, driven by the proliferation of more devices, which has led to the need for enhanced security at the edge, as well. The need for a unified cloud experience everywhere has grown, as well, in order to manage the growth of data at the edge. With the abundance of data, there are opportunities to develop AI tools with powerful computational abilities to extract insights and value from the captured data. We expect these market dynamics and trends to continue in the longer term.

Observing these dynamics, we have accelerated our investment and innovation efforts in these areas that we see as critical to our long-term strategy and growth, including in pivoting our go-to-market motion and sales function. At the same time, we continue to strengthen our core Compute and Storage-oriented offerings and expand our offerings on the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, to enable execution of our aaS pivot to become the edge-to-cloud company for our customers and partners. Furthermore, as noted elsewhere in this report, effective November 1, 2023, we have realigned our financial reporting segments to align with these key market trends. It is uncertain whether we will successfully execute this shift in strategic focus, realize the anticipated benefits of doing so, or capture the anticipated shares of the AI, hybrid cloud, and edge markets. 
 The following Executive Overview, Results of Operations and Liquidity discussions and analysis compare fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2022 , unless otherwise noted. The Capital Resources and, Cash Requirements and Commitments sections present information as of October 31, 2023, unless otherwise noted. 
 
 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 Net revenue of 29.1 billion represented an increase of 2.2 (increased 5.5 on a constant currency basis) primarily due to higher average unit prices AUPs in the Intelligent Edge and Compute segments, and higher customer acceptances in the High Performance Computing Artificial Intelligence HPC AI segment. The increase in net revenue was moderated by a decline in server unit volume in the Compute segment and unfavorable currency fluctuations. The gross profit margin of 35.1 (or 10.2 billion) represents an increase of 1.7 percentage points from the prior-year period due to the impact of higher-margin networking revenue, higher AUPs in Intelligent Edge and Compute, and lower supply chain and commodity costs. T he operating profit margin of 7.2 , repre sents an increase of 4.5 percentage points primarily due to the aforementioned gross margin improvement, goodwill impairment charges for the HPC AI and Software businesses in the prior-year period, and lower transformation expenses in the current period. The increase in operating profit margin was moderated by higher planned investments in research and development in the current period.

Each non-GAAP financial measure has been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure herein. Please refer to the section GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations included in this MD A for these reconciliations, a discussion of the use, usefulness and economic substance of the non-GAAP financial measures, along with a discussion of material limitations, and compensation for those limitations, associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. 
 Annualized Revenue Run-rate ARR 
 Our pivot to aaS continues its strong momentum with the addition of HPE GreenLake Cloud Services. Our mix of ARR is becoming more software-rich as we build our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, which is improving our margin profile. On the innovation front, we announced a transformative new data storage services platform that brings our cloud operations model to wherever data lives by unifying data operations. The platform will be available through HPE GreenLake Central and includes a new data services cloud console and a suite of software subscription services that simplifies and automates global infrastructure at scale. We will continue to invest aggressively in HPE GreenLake Cloud Services to provide a true cloud experience and operating model, whether at the edge, on-premises or across multiple clouds. 
 ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income from finance leases), and software-as-a-service, software consumption revenue, and other aaS offerings, recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. We believe that ARR is a metric that allows management to better understand and highlight the potential future performance of our aaS business. We also believe ARR provides investors with greater transparency to our financial information and of the performance metric used in our financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management. We use ARR as a performance metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with it. 
 ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers. 
 The following presents our ARR as of October 31, 2023 and 2022: For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 2022 Dollars in millions ARR 1,304 936 Year-over-year growth rate 39 17 
 The 39 year over year increase in ARR was due primarily to growth in our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, which was due to an expanding customer installed base and expanded range of offerings on the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. At the segment level, the growth was led by Intelligent Edge aaS and Storage aaS activity. 
 Returning capital to our shareholders remains an important part of our capital allocation framework, which also consists of strategic investments. We believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, are sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations. As of October 31, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were 4.6 billion, compared to 4.8 billion as of October 31, 2022, representing a decrease of 0.2 billion.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ), which requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. A summary of significant accounting policies and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our Consolidated Financial Statements are included in Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to material level of judgment related to matters that are highly uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. 
 We believe the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We enter into contracts with customers that may include combinations of products and services, resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products and/or various services. 
 The majority of our revenue is derived from sales of products and services and the associated support and maintenance, and such revenue is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services is transferred to the customer at the transaction price. Transaction price is adjusted for variable consideration which may be offered in contracts with customers, partners, and distributors and may include rebates, volume-based discounts, price protection, and other incentive programs. 
 Significant judgment is applied in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. Variable consideration is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. 
 To recognize revenue for the products and services for which control has been transferred, we allocate the transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price SSP basis. For products and services sold as a bundle, the SSP is generally not directly observable and requires the Company to estimate SSP based on management judgment by considering available data such as internal margin objectives, pricing strategies, market/competitive conditions, historical profitability data, as well as other observable inputs. For certain products and services, the Company establishes SSP based on the observable price when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. The Company establishes SSP ranges for its products and services and reassesses them periodically. 
 Taxes on Earnings 
 We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns. We adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on our tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year. 
 We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse. 
 We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future sources of taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income, of the appropriate character, in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located, prior to their expiration under applicable tax laws.

Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings and basis differences for which we have not provided for U.S. federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings and basis differences indefinitely outside the U.S. We will remit non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries for which deferred U.S. state income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and when we determine that it is advantageous for business operations, tax, or cash management reasons. 
 We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and approximately 85 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our Provision for taxes, Net earnings and cash flows. Our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions and related interest, and uncertain tax positions from acquired companies. For further discussion on taxes on earnings, refer to Note 6, Taxes on Earnings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
 Goodwill 
 We review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on the first day of the fourth quarter, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. 
 As of October 31, 2023, our reporting units with goodwill are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 2, Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, with the exception of Corporate Investments and Other which contains five reporting units: Advisory and Professional Services, Athonet, legacy Communications and Media Solutions business, OpsRamp and Software. 
 When performing the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. An impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. For two of our reporting units, Athonet and OpsRamp, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount. The qualitative assessment requires management judgement in assessing factors including, but not limited to, the macroeconomic and industry environment as well as Company-specific factors. The assessments for Athonet and OpsRamp as of our test date indicated that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of these two reporting units are less than their carrying amounts. 
 For all of our other reporting units, we conduct a quantitative assessment. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived mostly from the income approach and, to a lesser extent, the market approach, with the exception of the Software reporting unit which uses a weighting derived solely from the market approach. Under the income approach, the fair value of a reporting unit is based on discounted cash flow analysis of management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance. This analysis includes significant assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, expected operating margins, and timing of expected future cash flows based on market conditions and customer acceptances. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital of comparable public companies adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the fair value is based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit. We weight the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit. 
 Our annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, did not result in any impairment charges. The excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from approximately 5 to 218 of the respective carrying amounts. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting 
 40

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

unit. Based on the results of this hypothetical 10 decrease all of the reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying amount, except for Compute. 
 The Compute reporting unit has goodwill of 7.7 billion as of October 31, 2023, and excess of fair value over carrying value of 5 as of the annual test date. The Compute business is facing challenges reflected in the results for October 31, 2023. The Compute business is cyclical in nature. Over the last several years, digital transformation drove increased investment to modernize infrastructure. However, in the current macroeconomic and inflationary environment, customers have slowed their investments resulting in lower server demand and competitive pricing. These dynamics are further compounded by higher supply chain costs. During this cycle, the Compute business continues to focus on capturing market share while maintaining operating margin. 
 
 The HPC AI reporting unit has goodwill of 2.9 billion as of October 31, 2023, and excess of fair value over carrying value of 12 as of the annual test date. The HPC AI business continues to face challenges related to supply chain constraints of key components and other operational challenges impacting our ability to achieve certain customer acceptance milestones required for revenue recognition and resulting cost increases associated with fulfilling contracts over longer than originally anticipated timelines. We currently believe these challenges will be successfully addressed as the supply chain constraints continue to improve. 
 
 In addition, effective November 1, 2023 (fiscal 2024), there were organizational changes impacting the composition of our reporting units. These changes will require us to perform an interim impairment assessment as of that date. If the global macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions worsen, projected revenue growth rates or projected operating margins are not achieved, weighted average cost of capital increases, or if we have a significant sustained decline in our stock price, it is possible our estimates about the Compute, HPC AI, or our other reporting units ability to successfully address the current challenges may change, which could result in the carrying value for our reporting units exceeding their estimated fair value resulting in potential impairment charges. 
 Our fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis resulted in impairment charges for goodwill related to the HPC AI and Software reporting units. There was no impairment of goodwill for our other reporting units. 
 The decline in the fair value of the HPC AI reporting unit in fiscal 2022 below its carrying value resulted from changes in expected future cash flows due to the continuation of supply chain constraints, and other operational challenges as well as an increase in cost of capital. As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of 815 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. 
 The decline in the fair value of the Software reporting unit in fiscal 2022 resulted primarily from a decline in market multiples. As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of 90 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. 
 Contingencies 
 We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss, if any, from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other updated information and events, pertaining to a particular case. 
 Based on our experience, we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingency matters further discussed in Note 17, Litigation and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, are not a meaningful indicator of our potential liability. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. We believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2023, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Revenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our overall net revenue. As a result, our revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis, which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prior-year period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This change in revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated as the quotient of (a) current year revenue converted to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's foreign currency exchange rates divided by (b) the prior-year period revenue. This information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends. This constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a GAAP basis. Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes. 
 Results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows: 
 For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 2022 2021 Dollars of Revenue Dollars of Revenue Dollars of Revenue Dollars in millions Net revenue 29,135 100.0 28,496 100.0 27,784 100.0 Cost of sales 18,896 64.9 18,990 66.6 18,408 66.3 Gross profit 10,239 35.1 9,506 33.4 9,376 33.7 Research and development 2,349 8.1 2,045 7.2 1,979 7.1 Selling, general and administrative 5,160 17.7 4,941 17.3 4,929 17.7 Amortization of intangible assets 288 1.0 293 1.0 354 1.3 Impairment of goodwill 905 3.2 Transformation costs 283 1.0 473 1.7 930 3.3 Disaster charges 1 48 0.2 16 0.1 Acquisition, disposition and other related charges 69 0.1 19 0.1 36 0.1 Earnings from operations 2,089 7.2 782 2.7 1,132 4.1 Interest and other, net (156) (0.5) (188) (0.7) (211) (0.8) Tax indemnification and other adjustments 55 0.2 (67) (0.2) 65 0.2 Non-service net periodic benefit (cost) credit (3) 134 0.5 70 0.3 Litigation judgment 2,351 8.5 Earnings from equity interests 245 0.8 215 0.8 180 0.6 Earnings before taxes 2,230 7.7 876 3.1 3,587 12.9 Provision for taxes (205) (0.7) (8) (0.1) (160) (0.6) Net earnings 2,025 7.0 868 3.0 3,427 12.3

Fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022 
 Net revenue 
 In fiscal 2023, total net revenue of 29.1 billion represented an increase of 639 million, or 2.2 (increased 5.5 on a constant currency basis). U.S. net revenue increased by 944 million, or 10.0 to 10.4 billion, and net revenue from outside of the U.S. decreased by 305 million, or 1.6 , to 18.7 billion. 
 The components of the weighted net revenue change by segment were as follows: 
 For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 2022 Percentage Points Compute (5.0) 1.6 HPC AI 2.6 0.1 Storage (0.7) (0.1) Intelligent Edge 5.4 1.3 Financial Services 0.5 (0.2) Corporate Investments and Other (0.4) Total segment 2.8 2.3 Elimination of intersegment net revenue and other (0.6) 0.3 Total HPE 2.2 2.6 
 Fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022 
 From a segment perspective, the primary factors contributing to the change in total net revenue are summarized as follows: 
 Compute net revenue decrease of 1,414 million, or 11.0 , primarily due to a decline in server unit volume and unfavorable currency fluctuations moderated by higher AUPs 
 HPC AI net revenue increase of 721 million, or 22.6 , primarily due to higher customer acceptances 
 Storage net revenue decrease of 188 million, or 4.1 , primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations 
 Intelligent Edge net revenue increase of 1,530 million, or 41.6 , primarily due to increased AUPs and volume and product mix effect 
 Financial Services net revenue increase of 141 million, or 4.2 , primarily due to higher rental revenue from higher average operating leases and higher finance income on finance leases due to an increasing interest rate environment 
 Corporate Investments and Other net revenue decrease of 5 million, or 0.4 , primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations 
 Gross Profit 
 Fiscal 2023 total gross profit margin of 35.1 represents an increase of 1.7 percentage points as compared to the respective prior year period. The increase was due to the impact of higher-margin networking revenue, higher AUPs in Intelligent Edge and Compute, and lower supply chain and commodity costs. Additionally, the increase was partially offset by lower gross profit from support services. 
 Operating expenses 
 Research and development R D 
 R D expense increased by 304 million, or 14.9 , led by Intelligent Edge, HPC AI and Storage. The increase was driven by higher employee costs due to an increase in software engineers to pursue our strategic goals, which contributed 15.6 percentage points to the change. 
 43 

Table of Contents 
 HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

Selling, general and administrative SG A 
 SG A expense increased by 219 million, or 4.4 , due primarily to higher travel and marketing expenses by 1.8 percentage points; increased employee costs by 1.7 percentage points; factoring fees, charitable donations, other general expenses and higher software expenditures, all of which contributed 1.9 percentage points to the change. The increase was partially offset by a combination of lower consulting costs and cost savings from our transformation programs. 
 Impairment of goodwill 
 Impairment of goodwill for fiscal 2022 represents a partial goodwill impairment charge of 905 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, as it was determined that the fair value of the HPC AI and Software reporting units was below the carrying value of their net assets. 
 Transformation programs and costs 
 Our transformation programs consist of the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan (launched in 2020) and the HPE Next Plan (launched in 2017). 
 Transformation costs decreased by 190 million, or 40.2 , due to lower charges incurred in the current period as these plans approach completion. Refer to Note 3, Transformation Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II for further discussion. 
 Disaster charges 
 Disaster charges decreased by 47 million or 97.9 due to charges recorded in fiscal 2022 driven by the Company s exit from its Russia and Belarus businesses. 
 Interest and other, net 
 Interest and other, net expense decreased by 32 million, due to favorable currency fluctuations and an increase in net interest income from higher interest rates, partially offset by an increase in impairments recorded on equity investments in fiscal 2023. 
 Tax indemnification and other adjustments 
 We record changes in certain pre-separation and pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which we remain liable on behalf of the separated or divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification. 
 We recorded Tax indemnification and other adjustments income of 55 million and expense of 67 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 In fiscal 2023, Tax indemnification and other adjustments included the favorable settlement of tax indemnification liabilities for certain pre-divestiture tax liabilities. In fiscal 2022, Tax indemnification and other adjustments resulted from changes in certain pre-separation tax liabilities, for which we partially shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which we were indemnified under the Termination and Mutual Release Agreement, and changes to certain pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables. 
 Non-service net periodic benefit (cost) credit 
 Non-service net periodic benefit (cost) credit represents the components of net periodic pension benefit costs, other than service cost, for the Hewlett Packard Enterprise defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans such as interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and the amortization of prior plan amendments and actuarial gains or losses. The benefit (cost) credit also includes the impact of any plan settlements, curtailments, or special termination benefits. 
 In fiscal 2023, Non-service net periodic benefit (cost) credit decreased by 137 million resulting in non-service net periodic benefit cost of 3 million in the current period, as compared to non-service net periodic benefit credit of 134 million in fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to higher interest cost as a result of higher discount rates, partially offset by higher expected returns on assets and lower amortized actuarial losses in the current period.

Earnings from equity interests 
 Earnings from equity interests primarily represents our 49 interest in H3C Technologies Co., Limited H3C and the amortization of our interest in a basis difference. In fiscal 2023, Earnings from equity interests increased by 30 million due primarily to lower amortization expense from basis difference in the current period. 
 Provision for taxes 
 For fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recorded income tax expense of 205 million and 8 million, respectively, which reflect effective tax rates of 9.2 and 0.9 , respectively. Our effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world but may also be materially impacted by discrete tax adjustments during the fiscal year. Our tax rate for fiscal 2022 also included the effects of the non-deductible goodwill impairment. The jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented include Puerto Rico and Singapore. 
 In fiscal 2023, we recorded 131 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included: 
 104 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs and acquisition, disposition and other related charges and 
 19 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. 
 In fiscal 2022, we recorded 454 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included: 
 150 million of income tax benefits related to releases of foreign valuation allowances, 
 99 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs and acquisition, disposition and other related charges,

 Change 
 Dollars in millions Net revenue 11,436 12,850 12,409 (11.0) Earnings from operations 1,569 1,821 1,382 (13.8) Earnings from operations as a of net revenue 13.7 14.2 11.1 
 
 Fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022 
 Compute net revenue decreased by 1,414 million, or 11.0 (decreased 7.1 on a constant currency basis), primarily due to a 1,424 million, or 14.3 , decrease in product revenue. The decline in product revenue was primarily due to lower server unit volume of 1,889 million, or 18.9 , and unfavorable currency fluctuations of 399 million. The product revenue decline was moderated by an increase in AUPs of 864 million, or 8.7 , led by higher sales of server configurations with more complex component architectures in our next generation products. 
 Compute earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 0.5 percentage points primarily due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue partially offset by a decrease in the cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to the scale of the net revenue decline. The decrease in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to higher AUPs moderated by unfavorable currency fluctuations and higher supply chain costs. 
 
 HPC AI

 Fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022 
 HPC AI net revenue increased by 721 million, or 22.6 (increased 25.2 on a constant currency basis), primarily due to a 759 million, or 33.6 , increase in product revenue. The product revenue increase was led by the HPE Cray Supercomputing product portfolio, as operational and supply improvements addressed challenges with achieving certain

customer acceptance milestones for revenue recognition. HPE Cray Supercomputing experienced a deal volume increase of 991 million, or 43.9 , moderated by lower AUPs of 358 million, or 15.8 . The product revenue was also impacted by unfavorable currency fluctuation of 69 million. Services revenue declined by 38 million, or 4.1 , primarily due to unfavorable portfolio mix of service offerings. 
 HPC AI earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively flat, driven by a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue partially offset by an increase in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue. 
 
 Storage 
 For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 2022 2021 2023 vs 2022 Change Dollars in millions Net revenue 4,415 4,603 4,635 (4.1) Earnings from operations 429 641 716 (33.1) Earnings from operations as a of net revenue 9.7 13.9 15.4 
 Fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022 
 Storage net revenue decreased by 188 million, or 4.1 (decreased 0.7 on a constant currency basis) primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations and a decrease in AUPs. Storage product revenue decreased by 187 million, or 6.9 , primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations of 122 million, a decrease in AUPs of 21 million, or 0.8 , led by HPE Alletra Storage portfolio and big data, a unit volume decrease of 25 million, or 0.9 , led by HPE Alletra Storage portfolio and moderated by big data, and lower revenue from Russia of 20 million. Storage services revenue remained relatively flat. 
 Storage earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decr eased 4.2 perce ntage points due to increases in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to unfavorable currency fluctuations partially offset by lower supply chain costs. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to incremental investments in R D and field selling costs. 
 
 Intelligent Edge 
 For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 2022 2021 2023 vs 2022 
 Change 
 Dollars in millions Net revenue 5,204 3,674 3,302 41.6 Earnings from operations 1,419 549 509 158.5 Earnings from operations as a of net revenue 27.3 14.9 15.4 
 Fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022 
 Intelligent Edge net revenue increased by 1,530 million, or 41.6 (increased 44.9 on a constant currency basis). Product revenue increased by 1,387 million, or 46.5 , led by higher AUPs of 1,257 million, or 42.2 , and a volume and product mix effect of 236 million, or 7.9 , moderated by unfavorable currency fluctuations of 106 million. The product revenue increase was led by switching and wireless local area network products, which benefited from improvements in the supply availability, and elevated order book levels at the beginning of the period. Services net revenue increased 143 million, or 20.6 , primarily led by our aaS and attached support service offerings. 
 Intelligent Edge earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 12.4 percentage points primarily due to decreases in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of product and services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to lower supply chain costs, moderating the decrease was a lower mix of higher-margin support services revenue. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased primarily due to our cost containment measures.

 Fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022 
 FS net revenue increased by 141 million, or 4.2 (increased 5.4 on a constant currency basis) due primarily to higher rental revenue from higher average operating leases and higher finance income on finance leases due to an increasing interest rate environment, partially offset by lower asset management revenue primarily from lower pre-owned asset sales and unfavorable currency fluctuations. 
 FS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 2.8 percentage points due primarily to an increase in cost of services as a percentage of net revenue, while operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue were relatively flat. The increase to cost of services as a percentage of net revenue resulted primarily from a combination of higher borrowing costs and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by lower bad debt expense. 
 Financing Volume 
 For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 2022 2021 In millions Financing volume 6,412 6,252 6,168 
 Financing volume, which represents the amount of financing provided to customers for equipment and related software and services, including intercompany activity, increased by 2.6 in fiscal 2023 as compared to the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by higher financing of HPE product sales and services, partially offset by lower financing of third-party product sales and services and unfavorable currency fluctuations. 
 Portfolio Assets and Ratios 
 The FS business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services companies, including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive FS amounts are substantially the same as those used by the Company. However, intercompany loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

 (1) Intercompany activity is eliminated in consolidation. 
 (2) Allowance for credit losses for financing receivables includes both the short- and long-term portions. 
 (3) Debt benefiting FS consists of intercompany equity that is treated as debt for segment reporting purposes, intercompany debt, and borrowing- and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries. Debt benefiting FS totaled 11.6 billion and 11.5 billion at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was determined by applying an assumed debt-to-equity ratio, which management believes to be comparable to that of other similar financing companies. FS equity at October 31, 2023 and 2022, was 1.7 billion and 1.6 billion, respectively. 
 As of October 31, 2023 and 2022 , FS net cash and cash equivalents balances were 700 million and 923 million, respectively. 
 Net portfolio assets as of October 31, 2023 increased 4.3 from October 31, 2022. The increase generally resulted from new financing volume exceeding portfolio runoff during the period, along with favorable currency fluctuations. 
 FS bad debt expense includes charges to general reserves, specific reserves and write-offs for sales-type, direct-financing and operating leases. FS recorded net bad debt expense of 59 million, 82 million and 95 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 Fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022 
 Corporate Investments and Other net revenue decreased by 5 million, or 0.4 (increased 3.3 on a constant currency basis) primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations. 
 Corporate Investments and Other loss from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 6.5 percenta ge points primarily due to an increase in cost of services and operating expense as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in cost of services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations, higher services delivery costs and higher variable compensation expense. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to higher variable compensation expense.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Current Overview 
 We use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that internally generated cash flows will be generally sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, product development initiatives, acquisitions and disposal activities including legal settlements, restructuring activities, transformation costs, indemnifications, maturing debt, interest payments, and income tax payments, in addition to any future investments, share repurchases, and stockholder dividend payments. We expect to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, by accessing the capital markets, issuing commercial paper, and borrowing under credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions. However, our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions. We anticipate that the funds made available and cash generated from operations along with our access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A and market risks identified in the section entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A. 
 Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with a substantial amount held outside the U.S as of October 31, 2023. We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to provide availability of our worldwide cash when and where it is needed. 
 Amounts held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support our non-U.S. liquidity needs. Repatriations of amounts held outside the U.S. generally should not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is to keep cash balances outside of the U.S. and to meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. We do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on the repatriation of amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. 
 In connection with the share repurchase program previously authorized by our Board of Directors, during fiscal 2023, we repurchased and settled an aggregate amount of 0.4 billion. As of October 31, 2023, we had a remaining authorization of approximately 1.0 billion for future share repurchases. For more information on our share repurchase program, refer to Note 15, Stockholders' Equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
 Pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement among our relevant subsidiaries, Unisplendour International Technology Limited UNIS ), and H3C dated as of May 1, 2016, as amended from time to time, and most recently on October 28, 2022, we delivered a notice to UNIS on December 30, 2022, to exercise our right to put to UNIS, for cash consideration, all of the H3C shares held by us, which represent 49 of the total issued share capital of H3C. On May 26, 2023, our relevant subsidiaries entered into a Put Share Purchase Agreement with UNIS, whereby UNIS has agreed to purchase all of the H3C shares held by us, through our subsidiaries, for a total pre-tax cash consideration of 3.5 billion. We intend to consider a range of allocation activities, in line with our practice of pursuing a balanced, returns-based approach for capital allocation decisions, including but not limited to organic and strategic investments, return of capital to shareholders, repayment and/or redemption of outstanding debt, and general corporate purposes. The disposition remains subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and completion of certain conditions necessary for closing.

 The tables below represent the way in which management reviews cash flows: 
 For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 2022 2021 In millions Net cash provided by operating activities 4,428 4,593 5,871 Net cash used in investing activities (3,284) (2,087) (2,796) Net cash used in financing activities (1,362) (1,796) (3,364) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 36 (279) Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (182) 431 (289) Free Cash Flow 2,238 1,794 1,551 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decrease d by 165 million for fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable working capital primarily resulting from higher vendor payments and an increase in financing receivables, moderated by unfavorable hedging positions, lower cash payouts for variable compensation, and favorable impacts from other assets and liabilities during the current period. 
 Our working capital metrics and cash conversion impacts were as follows: 
 As of October 31, 2023 2022 2021 Days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable DSO 43 47 49 Days of supply in inventory DOS 87 88 82 Days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable DPO (134) (149) (128) Cash conversion cycle (4) (14) 3 
 The cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO. Items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix, changes in payment terms (including extended payment terms to customers or from suppliers), early or late invoice payments from customers or to suppliers, the extent of receivables factoring, seasonal trends, the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period, the impact of commodity costs and acquisition activity. 
 DSO measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average of net revenue. Compared to the three-month

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

period ending October 31, 2022, the decrease in DSO by 4 days in the current period was primarily due to higher early collections and receivables factoring. 
 DOS measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DOS is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. Compared to the corresponding three-month period ending October 31, 2022, the DOS remained relatively flat. 
 DPO measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. Compared to the corresponding three-month period ending October 31, 2022, the decrease in DPO by 15 days in the current period was primarily due to lower inventory purchases during the current period. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by 1.2 billion in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to payments made in connection with business acquisitions of 0.8 billion, higher cash utilized in net financial collateral activities of 0.5 billion, lower proceeds from maturities and sales of investments, net of purchases of 0.2 billion, offset by lower investment in property, plant and equipment of 0.3 billion, as compared to the prior-year period. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities decreased by 0.4 billion in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from debt, net of issuance costs of 1.4 billion, offset by higher repayments of debt and short-term borrowings of 1.0 billion, as compared to the prior-year period. 
 Free Cash Flow 
 Free cash flow FCF represents cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures (investments in property, plant and equipment PP E less proceeds from the sale of PP E), and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. FCF increased by 0.4 billion in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, due to a favorable currency impact on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, lower cash utilized for investments in PP E, moderated by lower cash provided from operations, as compared to the prior-year period. For more information on our FCF, refer to the section entitled GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations included in this MD A. 
 For more information on the impact from operating assets and liabilities to cash flows, see Note 7, Balance Sheet Details, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
 Capital Resources 
 Debt Levels 
 As of October 31, 2023 2022 2021 Dollars in millions Short-term debt 4,868 4,612 3,552 Long-term debt 7,487 7,853 9,896 Weighted-average interest rate 5.4 4.0 2.9 
 We maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase activities, our cost of capital, and targeted capital structure. We maintain a revolving credit facility and two commercial paper programs, "the Parent Programs", and a wholly-owned subsidiary maintains a third program. There have been no changes to our commercial paper programs and revolving credit facility since October 31, 2022. 
 In December 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to sell, at any time and from time to time, in one or more offerings, debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, depository shares, purchase contracts, guarantees or units consisting of any of these securities. The shelf registration statement expired in December 2023, and we expect to file a new shelf registration statement around the time of the filing of this report.

Significant funding and liquidity activities for fiscal 2023 were as follows: 
 Debt Issuances: 
 In March 2023 and June 2023, we issued 1.3 billion and 250 million, respectively, of 5.90 Senior Notes due October 1, 2024 
 In March 2023, we issued 400 million of 6.102 Senior Notes due April 1, 2026 
 In March and April 2023, we issued 643 million of asset-backed debt securities in five tranches with a weighted average interest rate of 5.59 and final maturity date of April 20, 2028 
 In June 2023, we issued 550 million of 5.25 Senior Notes due July 1, 2028 
 In September 2023, we issued 612 million of asset-backed debt securities in six tranches with a weighted average interest rate of 6.40 and final maturity date of July 21, 2031 . 
 Debt Repayments: 
 In April 2023, we repaid 1.0 billion of 2.25 fixed rate Senior Notes 
 In October 2023, we repaid 1.25 billion of 4.45 Senior Notes 
 During fiscal 2023, we repaid 1.7 billion of the outstanding asset-backed debt securities. 
 Our weighted-average interest rate reflects the average effective rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the impact of interest rate swaps. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 13, Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
 For more information on our available borrowing resources and the impact of operating assets and liabilities to cash flows, see Note 14, Borrowings, and Note 7, Balance Sheet Details, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
 Cash Requirements and Commitments 
 Long-term debt and interest payments on debt 
 As of October 31, 2023, future principal payment obligations on our long-term debt including asset-backed debt securities totaled 11.7 billion of which 4.0 billion is due within one year. As of October 31, 2023, our finance lease obligations, including interest, was 48 million, of which 6 million is to be due within one year. For more information on our debt, see Note 14, Borrowings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
 As of October 31, 2023, future interest payments relating to our long-term debt is estimated to be approximately 3.5 billion, of which 0.6 billion is expected to be due within one year. We use interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure of our fixed rate debt to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates, or hedge the variability of cash flows in the interest payments associated with our variable-rate debt. The impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps as of October 31, 2023 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on long-term debt. 
 Operating lease obligations 
 We enter into various leases as a lessee for assets including office buildings, data centers, vehicles, and aviation. As of October 31, 2023, operating lease obligations, net of sublease rental income totaled 1.6 billion, of which 216 million is due within one year. These amounts included uncommenced operating leases as of October 31, 2023, and did not reflect imputed interest adjustments. For more information on our leases, see Note 8, Accounting for Leases as a Lessee, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
 Unconditional purchase obligations 
 Our unconditional purchase obligations are related principally to inventory purchases, software maintenance and support services and other items. Unconditional purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty. As of October 31, 2023, unconditional purchase obligations totaled 1.6 billion, of which 580 million is due within one year. For more information on our unconditional purchase obligations, see Note 19, Commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.

Retirement Benefit Plan Funding 
 In fiscal 2024, we anticipate making contributions of 182 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. Our policy is to fund pension plans to meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by various authorities including local government and taxing authorities. Expected contributions and payments to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans are not considered as contractual obligations because they do not represent contractual cash outflows, as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes. For more information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 4, Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
 Restructuring Plans 
 As of October 31, 2023, we expect future cash payments of approximately 360 million in connection with our approved restructuring plans, which includes 240 million expected to be paid in fiscal 2024 and 120 million expected to be paid thereafter. Payments for restructuring activities are not considered as contractual obligations, because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments. For more information on our restructuring activities, see Note 3, Transformation Programs, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
 Uncertain Tax Positions 
 As of October 31, 2023, we had approximately 224 million of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions. These liabilities and related interest and penalties include 9 million expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining amount, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. Payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. For more information on our uncertain tax positions, see Note 6, Taxes on Earnings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 
 We have third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. For more information on our third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements, see Note 7, Balance Sheet Details, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The non-GAAP financial measures presented are net revenue on a constant currency basis (including at the business segment level), non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP earnings from operations, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, and FCF. These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net revenue on a constant currency basis is net revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP earnings from operations is earnings from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue) is operating profit margin (earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP income tax rate is income tax rate. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to FCF is cash flow from operations. 
 We believe that providing the non-GAAP measures stated above, in addition to the related GAAP measures provides greater transparency to the information used in our financial and operational decision making and allows the reader of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to see our financial results through the eyes of management. We further believe that providing this information provides investors with a supplemental view to understand our historical and prospective 
 operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of our operating performance with the performance of other companies in the same industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner. 
 Economic Substance of non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change to the foreign exchange rate utilized in the comparable prior-year period. This measure assists investors with evaluating our past and future performance, without the impact of foreign exchange rates, as more than half of our revenue is generated outside of the U.S. 
 We believe that excluding the items mentioned below from the non-GAAP financial measures provides a supplemental view to management and our investors of our consolidated financial performance and presents the financial results of the business without costs that we do not believe to be reflective of our ongoing operating results. Exclusion of these items can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP measure and cash flows thus limiting the use of such non-GAAP financial measures as analytic tools. See Compensation for Limitations With Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for further information. 
 Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin are defined to exclude charges related to the amortization of initial direct costs, stock-based compensation expense, and disaster charges. See below for the reasons management excludes each item: 
 Amortization of initial direct costs represents the portion of lease origination costs incurred in prior fiscal years that do not qualify for capitalization under the new leasing standard. We exclude these costs as we elected the practical expedient under the new leasing standard. As a result, we did not adjust these historical costs to accumulated deficit. We believe that most financing companies did not elect this practical expedient and therefore we exclude these costs. This can have an impact on the equivalent GAAP measures and Financial Services segment results. 
 Stock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards at grant date. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, we exclude these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are non-cash expenses and our internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding stock-based compensation expense. 
 Disaster (recovery) charges are primarily related to the exit of our businesses in Russia and Belarus, and include credit losses of financing and trade receivables, employee severance and abandoned assets. Disaster (recovery) charges also include direct costs or recovery of these costs related to COVID-19 as a result of Hewlett Packard Enterprise-hosted, co-hosted, or sponsored event cancellations and subsequent shift to a virtual format. While we present various items as 
 57 

Table of Contents 
 HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

Disaster charges (recovery), we exclude Disaster charges (recovery) from these non-GAAP measures as the specific charges are non-recurring charges and not indicative of the operational performance of our business. 
 Non-GAAP earnings from operations and non-GAAP operating profit margin consist of earnings from operations or earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue excluding the items mentioned above and charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets, goodwill impairment, transformation costs and acquisition, disposition and other related charges. In addition to the items previously explained above, management excludes these items for the following reasons: 
 We incur charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets and exclude these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions. We exclude these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are noncash expenses and our internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding intangible asset amortization. Although this does not directly affect our cash position, the loss in value of intangible assets over time can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure. 
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Hewlett Packard Enterprise recorded an impairment charge for the goodwill associated with its HPC AI and Software reporting units following the annual goodwill impairment review. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of current operating performance and comparisons to operating performance in other periods. 
 Transformation costs represent net costs related to the (i) HPE Next Plan and (ii) Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan and include restructuring charges, program design and execution costs, costs incurred to transform our IT infrastructure, net gains from the sale of real estate and any impairment charges on real estate identified as part of the initiatives. We exclude these costs as they are discrete costs related to two specific transformation programs that were announced in 2017 and 2020, respectively, as multi-year programs necessary to transform the business and IT infrastructure following material divestiture transactions in 2017 and in response to COVID-19 and an evolving product portfolio in fiscal 2020. The primary elements of the HPE Next and the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan have been substantially completed by October 31, 2023. The exclusion of the transformation program costs from our non-GAAP financial measures as stated above is to provide a supplemental measure of our operating results that does not include material HPE Next Plan and Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan costs as we do not believe such costs to be reflective of our ongoing operating cost structure. Further as our transformation costs for these plans have materially fluctuated since 2017, have been materially declining since 2021 and we do not expect to incur material transformation costs related to these programs beyond fiscal 2023, we believe non-GAAP measures excluding these costs are useful to management and investors for comparing operating performance across multiple periods. 
 We incur costs related to our acquisition, disposition and other related charges. The charges are direct expenses, such as professional fees and retention costs, most of which are treated as non-cash or non-capitalized expenses. Charges may also include expenses associated with disposal activities including legal and arbitration settlements in connection with certain dispositions. We exclude these costs as these expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of our acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, our internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding these charges. 
 Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges mentioned above, as well as other items such as tax indemnification and other adjustments, non-service net periodic benefit cost (credit), earnings from equity interests, impairment of investment, and adjustments for taxes. The Adjustments for taxes line item includes certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of tax reform, structural rate adjustment, excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation, and adjustments for additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item. In addition to the items previously explained, management excludes these items for the following reasons: 
 Tax indemnification and other adjustments are primarily related to changes to certain pre-separation and pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which we remain liable on behalf of the separated or divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification. We exclude these income or charges and the associated tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to operating performance in prior periods.

 HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

Non-service net periodic benefit cost (credit) includes certain market-related factors such as (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortization of prior plan amendments, (iv) amortized actuarial gains or losses, (v) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments and (vi) impacts from other market-related factors associated with our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans. These market-driven retirement-related adjustments are primarily due to the change in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance. We exclude these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures and consider them to be outside the operational performance of the business. 
 Adjustment to earnings from equity interests includes the amortization of the basis difference in relation to the H3C divestiture and the resulting equity method investment in H3C. In the first fiscal quarter of 2023, this adjustment also included our portion of intangible asset impairment charges from H3C. We believe that eliminating this amount for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates the evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to operating performance in prior periods. 
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, HPE recorded an impairment charge for an equity investment resulting from a permanent reduction of the investee s assets. This adjustment was reflected in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We believe eliminating impairment of investment for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates the evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to operating performance in prior periods. 
 We utilize a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate in order to provide consistency across the interim reporting periods and to eliminate the effects of items not directly related to our operating structure that can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, we evaluated a three-year financial projection. The projected rate assumes no incremental acquisitions in the three-year projection period and considers other factors including our expected tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions and current impacts from key legislation implemented in major jurisdictions where we operate. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, we used a non-GAAP income tax rate of 14 . The non-GAAP income tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to our strategy or business operations. We will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. We believe that making these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures, facilitates a supplemental evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results. 
 FCF is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as cash flow from operations, excluding the impact of proceeds received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 from a one-time Itanium litigation judgment, less net capital expenditures (investments in PP E less proceeds from the sale of PP E), and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. FCF does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period. Our management and investors can use FCF for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in our businesses, repurchasing stock and other purposes as well as evaluating our historical and prospective liquidity. 
 Compensation for Limitations With Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non- GAAP financial measures are that they can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures and cash flows, they may be calculated differently by other companies (limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes) and may not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of certain assets. 
 We compensate for these limitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. We also provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for this fiscal year and prior periods, and we encourage investors to review those reconciliations carefully.

 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below. 
 Actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change, as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure. 
 Foreign currency exchange rate risk 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact business in approximately 40 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2023 were the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound. For most currencies, we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency, a weaker U.S. dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures, if taken alone. 
 We use a combination of forward contracts and, from time to time, options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales, operating expenses, and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency, we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, consisting primarily of forward contracts, to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. Alternatively, we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures, primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge. 
 We have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 48 million and 49 million at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Interest rate risk 
 We also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued, our debt investment portfolio and net portfolio assets of our Financial Services segment. We issue long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing. 
 We often use interest rate and/or currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve U.S. dollar based floating or fixed interest expense. The swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments. However, in circumstances where we believe additional fixed-rate debt would be beneficial, we may choose to terminate a previously executed swap, or swap certain floating interest payments to fixed. 
 We have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover our debt, debt investments, net portfolio assets, and interest rate swaps. The analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt, debt investments, net portfolio assets, and interest rate swaps. The discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt, debt investments and net portfolio assets, net of interest rate swaps, of 41 million and 32 million at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and subsidiaries the Company as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at October 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated December 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Valuation of goodwill Description of the matter At October 31, 2023, the Company s goodwill was 18 billion, of which 7.7 billion related to the Compute reporting unit and 2.9 billion related to the High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence HPC AI reporting unit. As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level and more frequently when warranted based on indicators of impairment. Auditing management s goodwill impairment test for the Compute and HPC AI reporting units was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting units. In particular, the fair value estimates of the Compute and HPC AI reporting units were sensitive to significant assumptions, such as changes in the weighted average cost of capital, revenue growth rate, operating margin and terminal value, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. 
 
 62 

Table of Contents 

 How we addressed the matter in our audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s goodwill impairment review process, including controls over the significant assumptions described above. 
 To test the estimated fair value of the Company s Compute and HPC AI reporting units, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends and evaluated whether changes to the Company s business model, product mix and other factors would affect the significant assumptions. We assessed the historical accuracy of management s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions. 
 In addition, we tested management s reconciliation of the fair value of all the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company. We involved our valuation professionals to evaluate the application of valuation methodologies in the Company s annual impairment test. 
 Estimation of variable consideration Description of the matter As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue for sales to its customers after deducting management s estimates of variable consideration which may include various rebates, volume-based discounts, price protection, and other incentive programs that are offered to customers, partners, and distributors. Estimated variable consideration is presented within other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and totaled 1.1 billion at October 31, 2023. Auditing the estimates of variable consideration associated with rebates was complex and judgmental due to the level of uncertainty involved in management s estimate of expected usage of these programs. 
 How we addressed 
 the matter in our audit 
 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s process for estimating rebates, including controls over the significant assumptions described above. 
 To test the Company s determination of variable consideration we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the methodologies, testing the significant assumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We compared the significant assumptions to historical experience of the Company to develop an expectation of the rebates associated with product remaining in the distribution channel at October 31, 2023, which we compared to management s recorded amount. In addition, we inspected the underlying agreements and compared the incentive rates used in the Company s analyses with contractual rates. We assessed the historical accuracy of management s estimates by comparing previous estimates of rebate liabilities to the amount of actual payments in subsequent periods.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Up to million, million and million of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits at October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, would affect its effective tax rate if realized in their respective periods. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company effectively settled with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service IRS for fiscal 2016, primarily contributing to the reduction in the Company's unrecognized tax benefits of billion, which was predominantly related to the timing of intercompany royalty revenue recognition which does not affect the Company s effective tax rate. 
 The Company recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in Provision for taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company recognized million and million of interest income and million of interest expense in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had accrued million and million, respectively, for interest and penalties in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and approximately other countries and is subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. 
 The Company engages in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax audits for years prior to 2017. The IRS is conducting audits of the Company's fiscal 2017 through 2022 U.S. federal income tax returns. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the IRS issued notices of proposed adjustments NOPAs for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 relating to HPE s intercompany transfer pricing. After the close of fiscal 2023, the IRS issued a Revenue Agent Report RAR finalizing their position on the NOPAs for the same issues and same fiscal years. The IRS is seeking to increase taxable income across the three fiscal years by million. As of the balance sheet date, HPE has sufficient tax credit carryforwards to offset any incremental tax liability from the adjustments in the RAR. However, HPE disagrees with the IRS adjustments and believes the positions taken on its tax returns are more likely than not to prevail on technical merits, and the Company will defend these positions through the IRS administrative processes, as necessary. Accordingly, no changes have been made to the Company s reserves for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2023 relating to the IRS adjustments. With respect to major state and foreign tax jurisdictions, the Company is no longer subject to tax authority examinations for years prior to 2005. However, it is reasonably possible that certain foreign and state tax issues may be concluded in the next months, including issues involving resolution of certain intercompany transactions and other matters. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that its existing unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by an amount up to million within the next months.

 Goodwill Impairments 
 Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, as of the first day of the fourth quarter, at the reporting unit level. As of October 31, 2023, the Company's reporting units with goodwill are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 2, Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with the exception of Corporate Investments and Other which contains reporting units: A PS, Athonet, legacy CMS, OpsRamp, and Software. 
 The Company s fiscal 2023 annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in any impairment. The excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from approximately to of the respective carrying amounts. 
 The Compute reporting unit has goodwill of billion as of October 31, 2023, and excess of fair value over carrying value of as of the annual test date. The Compute business is facing challenges reflected in the results for October 31, 2023. The Compute business is cyclical in nature. Over the last several years, digital transformation drove increased investment to modernize infrastructure. However, in the current macroeconomic and inflationary environment, customers have slowed their investments resulting in lower server demand and competitive pricing. These dynamics are further compounded by higher supply chain costs. During this cycle, the Compute business continues to focus on capturing market share while maintaining operating margin. 
 The HPC AI reporting unit has goodwill of billion as of October 31, 2023, and excess of fair value over carrying value of as of the annual test date. The HPC AI business continues to face challenges related to supply chain constraints of key components and other operational challenges impacting our ability to achieve certain customer acceptance milestones required for revenue recognition and resulting cost increases associated with fulfilling contracts over longer than originally anticipated timelines. We currently believe these challenges will be successfully addressed as the supply chain constraints continue to improve. 
 The Company s fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis resulted in impairment charges for goodwill related to the HPC AI and Software reporting units. There was no impairment of goodwill for our other reporting units. 
 The decline in the fair value of the HPC AI reporting unit below its carrying value resulted from changes in expected future cash flows due to the continuation of supply chain constraints, and other operational challenges as well as an increase in cost of capital. As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. 
 The decline in the fair value of the Software reporting unit resulted primarily from a decline in market multiples. As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. 
 Based on the results of the Company's interim and annual impairment tests in fiscal 2021, the Company determined that no impairment of goodwill existed.

The Company may enter into fair value hedges, such as interest rate swaps, to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving a primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest rate which was replaced with SOFR starting in July of fiscal 2023. The swap transactions generally involve principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts. Alternatively, the Company may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if it believes a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial. When investing in fixed-rate instruments, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that convert the fixed interest payments into variable interest payments and may designate these swaps as fair value hedges. 
 For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the Company recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change. 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 The Company uses forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales, operating expenses, and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company's foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally

 ; however, forward contracts associated with sales-type and direct-financing leases and intercompany loans extend for the duration of the lease or loan term, which can extend up to . 
 For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, and as long as they remain highly effective, the Company records the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the same financial statement line item when the hedged transaction is recognized. 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 The Company uses forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency. The Company records the changes in the fair value of the hedged items in cumulative translation adjustment as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Other Derivatives 
 Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts used to hedge foreign currency-denominated balance sheet exposures. The Company also uses total return swaps, based on equity or fixed income indices, to hedge its executive deferred compensation plan liability. 
 For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the Company recognizes changes in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.

 Offsetting of Derivative Instruments 
 The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and collateral security arrangements. The Company does not offset the fair value of its derivative instruments against the fair value of cash collateral posted under collateral security agreements.

 The following description of the terms of the common stock of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company we , our , us or the Company is a summary and is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws ), each of which is included as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this exhibit is a part. . We encourage you to read our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL for additional information. 
 
 General 
 
 Under our Certificate of Incorporation, our authorized capital stock consists of 9,900,000,000 shares, consisting of 9,600,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, and 300,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. 
 
 Common Stock 
 
 Voting Rights Each holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted upon by the common stockholders. Holders of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. 
 
 Dividend Rights Subject to any preferential rights of holders of our outstanding preferred stock, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive ratably the dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. 
 
 Liquidation Rights Subject to any preferential rights of holders of our outstanding preferred stock, upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, holders of our common stock are entitled to ratable distribution of its assets remaining after the payment in full of liabilities and any preferential rights of any holders of then-outstanding preferred stock. 
 
 Others Rights, Restrictions and Preferences Holders of our common stock will have no preemptive, conversion rights or other subscription rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. The common stock currently outstanding is validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 
 
 Preferred Stock 
 
 The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock. that we may designate and issue in the future. Our board of directors has the authority, without further action by our stockholders, to issue up to 300,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms, and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on our common stock, diluting the voting power of our common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of our common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. 
 
 Certain Anti-Takeover Effects 
 
 We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless 

a. prior to such time, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder 
 b. upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding those shares owned 
 i. by persons who are directors and also officers and 
 ii. by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer or 
 c. at or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2 3 of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. 
 
 In general, Section 203 defines business combination to include 
 
 a. any merger or consolidation involving (i) the corporation or a direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the corporation and (ii) the interested stockholder or any other corporation, partnership or entity if the merger or consolidation is caused by the interested stockholder and as a result of such merger or consolidation any of (a), (b) or (c) above is not applicable to the surviving entity 
 b. any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10 or more of the assets or outstanding stock of the corporation or any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the corporation to or with the interested stockholder 
 c. subject to certain exceptions, any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation or any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the corporation of any stock of the corporation or such subsidiary to the interested stockholder 
 d. any transaction involving the corporation or any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the corporation that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series, or securities convertible into the stock of any class or series, of the corporation or any such subsidiary which is beneficially owned by the interested stockholder or 
 e. the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit, directly or indirectly, of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or through the corporation or any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the corporation. 
 
 In general, Section 203 defines an interested stockholder as any person who or which beneficially owns 15 or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation or any person affiliated or associated with or controlling or controlled by the corporation that was the owner of 15 or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation at any time within the three-year period immediately prior to the date of determination if such person is an interested stockholder, and the affiliates and associates of such person. 
 
 The existence of this provision would be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by stockholders. 
 
 Authorized but Unissued Shares 
 
 Our authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock will generally be available for future issuance without your approval. We may use such additional shares for a variety of purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, to fund acquisitions and as employee compensation. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of Hewlett Packard Enterprise by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. 
 
 Exclusive Forum 

Our Bylaws provide that unless we select or consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum (a) the sole and exclusive forum for any complaint asserting any internal corporate claims (as defined in Section 115 of the DGCL), to the fullest extent permitted by law, and subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have, or declines to accept, jurisdiction, another state court or a federal court located within the State of Delaware) and (b) the sole and exclusive forum for any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall be the federal district courts of the United States of America. While the Delaware Supreme Court has upheld the validity of similar provisions under the DGCL, there is uncertainty as to whether a court in another state would enforce such a forum selection provision. Our exclusive forum provision does not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws, and nothing in the exclusive forum provision of our Bylaws affects suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

 THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows 
 
 1. Grant of Restricted Stock Units Team Member Acceptance Procedures. 
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Grant Agreement and of the Plan, the Company hereby grants to the Team Member the number of RSUs set forth above. As is described below, if the Team Member declines this Grant Agreement via the Merrill Benefits Online website (www.mybenefits.ml.com) or fails to accept this Grant Agreement via the Merrill Benefits Online website by an applicable deadline set forth below, then the RSUs shall terminate and will become null and void . 
 
 If the Team Member resides in a European Economic Area or European Union member state or in Brazil or in Israel, due to legal requirements, the Team Member must accept this Grant Agreement via the Merrill Benefits Online website (www.mybenefits.ml.com) by the Acceptance Deadline below or the RSUs shall terminate and will become null and void. The Acceptance Deadline is the earlier of (i) the date eleven (11) months after the Grant Date above (e.g., if Grant Date is December 1st, this date would be the following November 1st) and (ii) the Team Member s last day of employment. However, if the Acceptance Deadline would otherwise be a weekend, U.S. holiday or other non-trading day, the Acceptance Deadline will instead be the next following trading day for the New York Stock Exchange. 
 
 If the Team Member does not reside in a European Economic Area or European Union member state nor in Brazil nor in Israel and also does not agree with the terms and conditions of this Grant Agreement, then the Team Member must reject via the Merrill Benefits Online website (www.mybenefits.ml.com) by the date forty-five (45) days after the Grant Date. If not rejected via the Merrill website by that deadline, then the Company will automatically accept the Grant Agreement on the Team Member's behalf (except in the case of Vice President-level and higher roles as described in the immediately following paragraph). The Team Member may not decline this Grant on or after the date the Company automatically accepts the Grant Agreement in this manner (i.e., on or after forty-five (45) days from the Grant Date). 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Team Member is employed in a Vice President-level or higher level role (which includes without limitation Fellow, Senior Fellow, Senior Vice President, Executive Vice President, and Executive Committee positions), and 
 1 

is notified by the Company of a requirement to accept the Grant Agreement and additional agreements as described in Section 17, then the Team Member must accept this Grant Agreement (and the additional agreements dictated by the Company) within 75 days of the Grant Date listed above (or, if such 75th day is a weekend, U.S. holiday or other non-trading day, then the following NYSE trading day). 
 
 2. Vesting Schedule. 
 The interest of the Team Member in the RSUs shall vest according to the vesting schedule set forth above, or if earlier, in accordance with Section 8 or 9, below, except to the extent a severance plan applicable to the Team Member provides otherwise. Unless the provisions of Section 8, 9 or 10 apply, the Team Member must remain in the employ of the Company or any approved Subsidiary or Affiliate on a continuous basis through the close of business on the applicable vesting date, as set forth above, and the Team Member must be in compliance with the requirements and conditions provided for in the Plan and this Grant Agreement in order for the interest of the Team Member in the RSUs to become fully vested on that date. For purposes of the preceding sentence, approved Subsidiaries do not include any Subsidiaries determined by the Administrator from time-to-time as being managed at arm s length from HPE (currently Hewlett-Packard CDS Nederland B.V. and its subsidiaries) therefore the RSUs shall not continue to vest during employment with any such Subsidiary that is not an approved Subsidiary. 
 
 3. Benefit Upon Vesting. 
 Within 75 days of each vesting date set forth on the above vesting schedule or, if earlier, a vesting event pursuant to Section 8 or 9 below, the Company shall deliver or pay, as applicable, to the Team Member (or the Team Member s guardian, estate or beneficiary in the event of Section 8 or 9) Shares or a combination of cash and Shares, as the Company determines in its sole discretion, with a value equal to 
 
 (a) the number of RSUs that have become vested as of such vesting date or vesting event, as applicable, multiplied by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date on which such RSUs vested plus 
 (b) a dividend equivalent payment determined by 
 (1) multiplying, separately, the number of RSUs that became vested as determined in Section 3(a) by the dividend per Share on each dividend payment date between the Grant Date and the applicable vesting date to determine the dividend equivalent amount for each applicable dividend payment date 
 (2) dividing the amount determined in Section 3(b)(1) by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the dividend payment date to determine the number of additional whole and fractional RSUs to be credited to the Team Member and 
 (3) multiplying the number of additional whole and fractional RSUs determined in Section 3(b)(2) by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the vesting date to determine the aggregate value of dividend equivalent payments for such vested RSUs 
 provided, however, that if any aggregated dividend equivalent payments in Section 3(b)(2) above to be delivered in Shares results in a payment of a fractional Share, such fractional Share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole Share. 
 
 4. Restrictions. 
 Except as otherwise provided for in this Grant Agreement, the RSUs or rights granted hereunder may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred. The period of time between the Grant Date and the date the RSUs become fully vested pursuant to Section 2 is referred to herein as the Restriction Period. 
 5. Custody of Restricted Stock Units. 
 The RSUs subject hereto shall be recorded in an account with the Plan broker in the name of the Team Member. Upon termination of the Restriction Period, if the Company determines, in its sole discretion, to deliver Shares pursuant to Section 3 above, such Shares shall be released into the Team Member s account provided, however, that a portion of such Shares shall be surrendered in payment of Tax-Related Items, as defined and in accordance with Section 12 below, unless the Company, in its sole discretion, establishes alternative procedures for the payment of Tax-Related Items. 
 
 6. No Stockholder Rights. 
 RSUs represent hypothetical Shares. The Team Member shall not be entitled to any of the rights or benefits generally accorded to stockholders until the Shares are issued to the Team Member pursuant to the terms of this Grant Agreement and the Team Member becomes a holder of record of the Shares following the vesting of the RSUs. 
 
 7. Termination of Employment. 
 Except as otherwise provided for in this Grant Agreement or in the Plan or as otherwise determined by the Company in its sole discretion, if the Team Member s employment with the Company (including any approved Subsidiary or Affiliate) is terminated at any time for any reason prior to the lapse of the Restriction Period, all unvested RSUs granted hereunder shall be forfeited by the Team Member, except to the extent a severance plan applicable to the Team Member provides otherwise. For purposes of the preceding sentence, approved Subsidiaries do not include any Subsidiaries determined by the Administrator from time-to-time as being managed at arm s length from HPE (currently Hewlett-Packard CDS Nederland B.V. and its subsidiaries) therefore the unvested RSUs would forfeit if employment transfers from HPE or approved Subsidiaries to employment with any such Subsidiary that is not an approved Subsidiary. 
 
 For purposes of this Grant Agreement, the Team Member s employment or service will be considered terminated as of the date the Team Member is no longer actively providing services to the Company (including any approved Subsidiary or Affiliate) (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Team Member is employed or retained or the terms of the Team Member s employment or service agreement, if any) and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., the Team Member s period of employment or service would not include any contractual notice period, common law notice period, severance notice period, or any period of garden leave or similar period mandated under the employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Team Member is employed or retained or the terms of the Team Member s employment or service agreement, if any). The Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Team Member s employment or service is terminated for purposes of this Grant Agreement (including whether the Team Member may still be considered to be providing service while on a leave of absence). 
 2 

8. Disability of the Team Member. 
 If the Team Member s employment is terminated prior to the end of the Restriction Period by reason of the Team Member s total and permanent disability, all RSUs shall immediately vest including any amounts for dividend equivalent payments on RSUs that vest at termination subject to the condition that, if applicable, the Team Member shall have executed a current Agreement Regarding Confidential Information and Proprietary Developments ARCIPD that is satisfactory to the Company, and shall not, during the Team Member s active employment with the Company and any-post employment period during which the RSUs remain outstanding, have engaged in any conduct that is in violation of any agreement with the Company concerning confidentiality of Company information or post-employment restrictive covenants. 
 
 9. Death of the Team Member. 
 In the event of the Team Member s death prior to the end of the Restriction Period, all unvested and outstanding RSUs shall immediately vest including any amounts for dividend equivalent payments on such vested RSUs. 
 
 10. Retirement of the Team Member. 
 If the Team Member s employment is terminated more than three months after the Grant Date and prior to the end of the Restriction Period by reason of the Team Member s retirement in accordance with the applicable retirement policy of the Company, all unvested RSUs shall continue to vest and payout in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth above subject to the condition that, if applicable, the Team Member shall have executed a current ARCIPD that is satisfactory to the Company, and shall not, during the Team Member s active employment with the Company and any-post employment period during which the RSUs remain outstanding, have engaged in any conduct that is in violation of any agreement with the Company concerning confidentiality of Company information or post-employment restrictive covenants. 
 
 11. Section 409A. 
 This section applies to the extent the Team Member is subject to taxation in the U.S. Payments made pursuant to the Plan and this Grant Agreement are intended to comply with or qualify for an exemption from Section 409A of the Code Section 409A ). The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend or modify the Plan and or this Grant Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, including any amendments or actions that would result in the reduction of benefits payable under this Grant Agreement, as the Company determines are necessary or appropriate to ensure that all RSUs are made in a manner that qualifies for an exemption from, or complies with, Section 409A or mitigate any additional tax, interest and or penalties or other adverse tax consequences that may apply under Section 409A provided however, that the Company makes no representations that the RSUs will be exempt from any penalties that may apply under Section 409A and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to this RSU. For the avoidance of doubt, the Team Member hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Company will have no liability to the Team Member or any other party if any amounts payable under this Grant Agreement are not exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A, or for any action taken by the Company with respect thereto. Any payments under this Grant Agreement that are considered non-qualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A NQDC and are payable on the date of, or a date that is determined by reference to, the Team Member's separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A) of a specified employee (as defined under Section 409A), shall be made on a date that is the earliest of (a) the Team Member s death, (b) the original specified settlement date and (c) the date which is one day following six months after the date of the Team Member s separation from service. If the RSUs or dividend equivalents are considered NQDC and the payment period contemplated in Sections 8 or 10 crosses a calendar year, the RSUs or dividend equivalents shall be paid in the second calendar year. 
 
 12. Taxes. 
 (a) The Team Member shall be liable for any and all taxes, including income tax, social insurance, fringe benefit tax, payroll tax, payment on account, employer taxes or other tax-related items related to the Team Member s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to or otherwise recoverable from the Team Member by the Company and or, if different, the Team Member s employer (the Employer whether incurred at grant, vesting, sale, prior to vesting or at any other time Tax-Related Items ). In the event that the Company or the Employer (which, for purposes of this Section 12, shall include a former employer) is required, allowed or permitted to withhold Tax-Related Items as a result of the RSUs or the Shares acquired pursuant to such RSUs, or due upon receipt of dividend equivalent payments or dividends, the Team Member shall surrender a sufficient number of whole Shares, make a cash payment or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and or the Employer to withhold such Tax-Related Items from the Team Member s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Team Member by the Company and or the Employer at the election of the Company, in its sole discretion, or, if permissible under local law, the Company may sell or arrange for the sale of Shares that the Team Member acquires as necessary to cover all Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer has to withhold or that are legally recoverable from the Team Member (such as fringe benefit tax), unless the Company, in its sole discretion, has established alternative procedures for such payment. If Team Member is categorized as an Officer, then the exclusive procedure for satisfying the Team Member s obligation regarding Tax-Related Items will be Company withholding of Shares from the Shares otherwise issuable to the Team Member as a result of the award vesting, except as specifically approved otherwise by the Committee. However, with respect to any RSUs subject to Section 409A, the Employer shall limit the surrender of Shares to the minimum number of Shares permitted to avoid a prohibited acceleration under Section 409A. The Team Member will receive a cash refund for any fraction of a surrendered Share or Shares in excess of any and all Tax-Related Items. To the extent that any surrender of Shares or payment of cash or alternative procedure for such payment is insufficient, the Team Member authorizes the Company, its Affiliates and Subsidiaries, which are qualified to deduct tax at source, to deduct from the Team Member s compensation all Tax-Related Items. The Team Member agrees to pay any Tax-Related Items that cannot be satisfied from wages or other cash compensation, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law. 
 
 The Company and or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in the Team Member s jurisdiction(s), in which case the Team Member will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, the Team Member is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of the Team Member s participation in the Plan. 
 
 3 

(b) Regardless of any action the Company or the Employer takes with respect to any or all Tax-Related Items, the Team Member acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Team Member s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer, if any. The Team Member further acknowledges that the Company and or the Employer (i) make no representations nor undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of this grant of RSUs or dividend equivalents, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of RSUs or dividend equivalents, the subsequent delivery of Shares and or cash upon settlement of such RSUs or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired pursuant to such RSUs and receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalent payments and (ii) notwithstanding Section 11, do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms or any aspect of this grant of RSUs and or dividend equivalents to reduce or eliminate the Team Member s liability for Tax-Related Items or to achieve any particular tax result. Further, if the Team Member has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Team Member acknowledges that the Company and or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. The Team Member shall pay the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Team Member s participation in the Plan or the Team Member s receipt of RSUs that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver the benefit described in Section 3 if the Team Member fails to comply with the Team Member s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. 
 
 (c) In accepting the RSUs, the Team Member consents and agrees that in the event the RSUs or the dividend equivalents become subject to an employer tax that is legally permitted to be recovered from the Team Member, as may be determined by the Company and or the Employer at their sole discretion, and whether or not the Team Member s employment with the Company and or the Employer is continuing at the time such tax becomes recoverable, the Team Member will assume any liability for any such taxes that may be payable by the Company and or the Employer in connection with the RSUs and dividend equivalents. Further, by accepting the RSUs, the Team Member agrees that the Company and or the Employer may collect any such taxes from the Team Member by any of the means set forth in this Section 12. The Team Member further agrees to execute any other consents or elections required to accomplish the above, promptly upon request of the Company.

The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates on an ongoing basis except as provided in the Plan. Consequently, the Team Member understands that the RSUs are granted on the assumption and condition that the RSUs or the Shares acquired upon vesting shall not become a part of any employment contract (either with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever. In addition, the Team Member understands that this grant would not be made to the Team Member but for the assumptions and conditions referred to above thus, the Team Member acknowledges and freely accepts that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then the RSUs shall be null and void. 
 The RSUs are a conditional right to Shares and can be forfeited in the case of, or affected by, the Team Member s termination of service or employment. This will be the case, for example, even if (1) the Team Member is considered to be unfairly dismissed without good cause (2) the Team Member is dismissed for disciplinary or objective reasons or due to a collective dismissal (3) the Team Member terminates employment or service due to a change of work location, duties or any other employment or contractual condition (4) the Team Member terminates employment or service due to unilateral breach of contract of the Company, the Employer, or any other Subsidiary or Affiliate or (5) the Team Member s employment or service terminates for any other reason whatsoever, except for reasons specified in the Grant Agreement. Consequently, upon termination of the Team Member s employment or service for any of the reasons set forth above, the Team Member may automatically lose any rights to the unvested RSUs granted to him or her as of the date of the Team Member s termination of employment, as described in the Plan and the Grant Agreement.

 THIS PERFORMANCE-ADJUSTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANT AGREEMENT (this Grant Agreement ), as of the Grant Date noted above between Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, a Delaware corporation (the Company ), and the Employee named above (the Team Member ), is entered into as follows 
 
 WHEREAS, the continued participation of the Team Member is considered by the Company to be important for the Company s continued growth and 
 
 WHEREAS, in order to align the interests of the Team Member with those of the shareholders of the Company and to facilitate the consistent governance of its internal affairs, and to give the Team Member an incentive to continue in the employ of the Company (or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries) and to accept any ancillary agreements designed to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company that are made a condition of this grant, the HR and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company or its delegates Committee has determined that the Team Member shall be granted performance-adjusted restricted stock units representing hypothetical shares of the Company s common stock PARSUs ), with each PARSU equal in value to one share of the Company s 0.01 par value common stock Share ), subject to the restrictions stated below and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plan named above Plan ), a copy of which can be found on the Long-term Incentives website along with a copy of the related prospectus. The target amount stated above reflects the target number of PARSUs that may be achieved if the performance criteria are attained at 100 of the target level performance (the Target Amount ), but the actual number of PARSUs that vest shall be determined based on the actual attainment level of performance at the end of each Segment. The Plan and the related prospectus also can be obtained by written or telephonic request to the Company Secretary. Unless otherwise defined in this Grant Agreement, any capitalized terms in this Grant Agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Plan. 
 
 THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows 
 
 1. Grant of Performance-Adjusted Restricted Stock Units. 
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Grant Agreement and of the Plan, the Company hereby grants to the Team Member the target amount of PARSUs set forth above. 
 
 2. Vesting Criteria and Performance Periods. 
 The Grant is divided into two separate segments, each with a different performance period, as set forth above. One-half (1 2) of the Target Amount (identified above) of PARSUs is subject to service and performance vesting criteria for Segment 1 (identified above), which is two (2) fiscal years, and one-half (1 2) of the Target Amount of the PARSUs is subject to service and performance vesting criteria for Segment 2 (identified above) which is three (3) fiscal years. Segment 1 and Segment 2 are each individually referred to as a Segment and are jointly referred to herein as Segments. 
 
 For each Segment, the Team Member will vest in the PARSUs subject to (a) the Company s achieving the performance vesting conditions, (b) the Team Member s continued employment through the last U.S. business day of the relevant Segment, and (c) the Team Member s compliance with the requirements and conditions provided for in the Plan and this Grant Agreement. Unless the provisions of Section 8, 9 or 10 apply or a severance plan applicable to the Team Member dictates otherwise, the Team Member must remain in the employ of the Company, any Subsidiary or Affiliate on a continuous basis through the close of business on the applicable Segment end date, as set forth above, and the Team Member must be in compliance with the requirements and 
 1 

conditions provided for in the Plan and this Grant Agreement in order for the interest of the Team Member in the PARSUs for that Segment to become fully vested. 
 
 The number of Shares for each Segment that will vest, subject to satisfaction of Sections 2(a) and 2(c), is determined in three steps. First, for each fiscal year during that Segment, the Company s performance against that fiscal year s Net Income (as defined below) goal is calculated and the mean average of the corresponding Net Income vesting rates for the Segment is calculated. Second, in all cases in which the certified Net Income performance is at or above the minimum threshold level of performance, 100 of the Target Amount of Shares for the Segment (i.e., 50 of the total Target Amount of Shares) is multiplied by the average Net Income vesting rate for the Segment. Third, the number of Shares eligible for vesting is increased or decreased by up to twenty percent (20 based on the modifier rate corresponding to the Company s TSR (as defined below) performance against the goal for that Segment. The Committee will certify the foregoing calculations within seventy-five days after the end of the Segment. 
 
 The number of PARSUs that vest for each Segment will be rounded to the nearest whole unit. After performance for the Segment is certified, any other potential PARSUs for that Segment that did not vest will immediately terminate. The aggregate number of Shares eligible for vesting for a Segment shall never exceed 200 of the Target Amount of Shares for the Segment, excluding the effect of dividend equivalents. No PARSUs will vest for a Segment if Net Income performance is below the minimum threshold level. 
 
 The Net Income and TSR goal levels and corresponding vesting rates will be identified to the Team Member in separate written communication from the Committee. The Committee may adjust any performance goal or criteria to reflect one or more events that occur during a Segment pursuant to Section 14 of the Plan. 
 
 (X) Net Income means the Company s Non-GAAP Net Earnings as reported in its public earnings releases, as automatically adjusted to exclude the cumulative effects of the following events to the extent not planned for by the Company at the time the applicable Net Income goal(s) were established (a) changes in amounts recorded due to changes in applicable accounting standards but only for changes having an effect (positive or negative, individually or in aggregate with other standards changes) of 5M or more on the year s Non-GAAP Net Earnings and or (b) changes in the Company s Non-GAAP income tax rate utilized in calculating Non-GAAP Net Earnings (also termed the structural tax rate) but only to the extent resulting from changes in applicable tax law. 
 
 (Y) TSR means relative total shareholder return of the Company s Common Stock (inclusive of immediate reinvestment of dividends) against the S&P 500 constituents during the Segment, calculated using the Fair Market Value on the trading day immediately prior to the beginning of the Segment and the Fair Market Value on the last day of the Segment. 
 
 3. Benefit Upon Vesting. 
 Within 75 days after the end of each Segment or, if earlier, a vesting event pursuant to Section 8 or 9 below, the Company shall deliver or pay, as applicable, to the Team Member (or the Team Member s guardian, estate or beneficiary in the event of Section 8 or 9) Shares or a combination of cash and Shares, as the Company determines in its sole discretion, with a value equal to 
 
 (a) the number of PARSUs that have become vested as of such vesting date or vesting event, as applicable, multiplied by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date on which such PARSUs vested plus 
 
 (b) a dividend equivalent payment determined by 
 (1) multiplying, separately, the number of PARSUs that became vested as determined in Section 3(a) by the dividend per Share on each dividend payment date between the Grant Date and the applicable vesting date to determine the dividend equivalent amount for each applicable dividend payment date 
 (2) dividing the amount determined in Section 3(b)(1) by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the dividend payment date to determine the number of additional whole and fractional PARSUs to be credited to the Team Member and 
 (3) multiplying the number of additional whole and fractional PARSUs determined in Section 3(b)(2) by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the vesting date to determine the aggregate value of dividend equivalent payments for such vested PARSUs 
 
 provided, however, that if any aggregated dividend equivalent payments in Section 3(b)(2) above to be delivered in Shares results in a payment of a fractional Share, such fractional Share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole Share. 
 
 4. Restrictions. 
 Except as otherwise provided for in this Grant Agreement, the PARSUs or rights granted hereunder may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred. The period of time between the Grant Date and the date the PARSUs become fully vested pursuant to Section 2 is referred to herein as the Restriction Period. 
 
 5. Custody of Performance-Adjusted Restricted Stock Units. 
 The PARSUs subject hereto shall be recorded in an account with the Plan broker in the name of the Team Member. Upon termination of the Restriction Period, if the Company determines, in its sole discretion, to deliver Shares pursuant to Section 3 above, such Shares shall be released into the Team Member s account provided, however, that a portion of such Shares shall be surrendered in payment of Tax-Related Items, as defined and in accordance with Section 12 below, unless the Company, in its sole discretion, establishes alternative procedures for the payment of Tax-Related Items. 
 
 6. No Stockholder Rights. 
 PARSUs represent hypothetical Shares. The Team Member shall not be entitled to any of the rights or benefits generally accorded to stockholders until the Shares are issued to the Team Member pursuant to the terms of this Grant Agreement and the Team Member becomes a holder of record of the Shares following the vesting of the PARSUs. 
 
 7. Termination of Employment. 
 Except as otherwise provided for in this Grant Agreement or in the Plan or as otherwise determined by the Company in its sole discretion, if the Team Member s employment with the Company, any Subsidiary or Affiliate is terminated at any time for any reason prior to the lapse of the Restriction Period, all unvested PARSUs granted hereunder shall be forfeited by the Team Member, except to the extent a severance plan applicable to the Team Member provides otherwise. 
 2 

For purposes of this Grant Agreement, the Team Member s employment or service will be considered terminated as of the date the Team Member is no longer actively providing services to the Company, any Subsidiary or Affiliate (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Team Member is employed or retained or the terms of the Team Member s employment or service agreement, if any) and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., the Team Member s period of employment or service would not include any contractual notice period, common law notice period, severance notice period, or any period of garden leave or similar period mandated under the employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Team Member is employed or retained or the terms of the Team Member s employment or service agreement, if any). The Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Team Member s employment or service is terminated for purposes of this Grant Agreement (including whether the Team Member may still be considered to be providing service while on a leave of absence). 
 
 8. Disability of the Team Member. 
 If the Team Member s employment is terminated prior to the end of the Restriction Period by reason of the Team Member s total and permanent disability, the Target Amount of Shares for each then-uncompleted Segment shall immediately vest including any amounts for dividend equivalent payments on PARSUs that vest at termination subject to the condition that the Team Member shall have executed a current Agreement Regarding Confidential Information and Proprietary Developments ARCIPD that is satisfactory to the Company, and shall not during the Team Member s active employment with the Company and any-post employment period during which the PARSUs remain outstanding, have engaged in any conduct that is in violation of any agreement with the Company concerning confidentiality of Company information or post-employment restrictive covenants. 
 
 9. Death of the Team Member. 
 In the event that termination of employment is due to the death of the Team Member prior to the end of the Restriction Period, the Target Amount of Shares for each then-uncompleted Segment shall immediately vest including any amounts for dividend equivalent payments on such vested PARSUs. 
 
 10. Retirement of the Team Member. 
 If the Team Member s employment is terminated more than three months after the Grant Date and prior to the end of the Restriction Period by reason of the Team Member s retirement in accordance with the applicable retirement policy of the Company, all unvested PARSUs shall continue to vest and payout in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth above , and for the avoidance of doubt, subject to satisfaction of the applicable performance criteria, and also subject to the condition that the Team Member shall have executed a current ARCIPD that is satisfactory to the Company, and shall not, during the Team Member s active employment with the Company and any-post employment period during which the PARSUs remain outstanding, have engaged in any conduct that is in violation of any agreement with the Company concerning confidentiality of Company information or post-employment restrictive covenants. 
 
 11. Section 409A. 
 This section applies to the extent the Team Member is subject to taxation in the U.S. Payments made pursuant to the Plan and this Grant Agreement are intended to comply with or qualify for an exemption from Section 409A of the Code Section 409A ). The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend or modify the Plan and or this Grant Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, including any amendments or actions that would result in the reduction of benefits payable under this Grant Agreement, as the Company determines are necessary or appropriate to ensure that all PARSUs are made in a manner that qualifies for an exemption from, or complies with, Section 409A or mitigate any additional tax, interest and or penalties or other adverse tax consequences that may apply under Section 409A provided however, that the Company makes no representations that the PARSUs will be exempt from any penalties that may apply under Section 409A and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to this PARSU. For the avoidance of doubt, the Team Member hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Company will have no liability to the Team Member or any other party if any amounts payable under this Grant Agreement are not exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A, or for any action taken by the Company with respect thereto. Any payments under this Grant Agreement that are considered non-qualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A NQDC and are payable on the date of, or a date that is determined by reference to, the Team Member's separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A) of a specified employee (as defined under Section 409A), shall be made on a date that is the earliest of (a) the Team Member s death, (b) the original specified settlement date and (c) the date which is one day following six months after the date of the Team Member s separation from service. If the PARSUs or dividend equivalents are considered NQDC and the payment period contemplated in Sections 8 or 10 crosses a calendar year, the PARSUs or dividend equivalents shall be paid in the second calendar year. 
 
 12. Taxes. 
 (a) The Team Member shall be liable for any and all taxes, including income tax, social insurance, fringe benefit tax, payroll tax, payment on account, employer taxes or other tax-related items related to the Team Member s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to or otherwise recoverable from the Team Member by the Company and or, if different, the Team Member s employer (the Employer whether incurred at grant, vesting, sale, prior to vesting or at any other time Tax-Related Items ). In the event that the Company or the Employer (which, for purposes of this Section 12, shall include a former employer) is required, allowed or permitted to withhold Tax-Related Items as a result of the PARSUs or the Shares acquired pursuant to such PARSUs, or due upon receipt of dividend equivalent payments or dividends, the Team Member shall surrender a sufficient number of whole Shares, make a cash payment or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and or the Employer to withhold such Tax-Related Items from the Team Member s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Team Member by the Company and or the Employer at the election of the Company, in its sole discretion, or, if permissible under local law, the Company may sell or arrange for the sale of Shares that the Team Member acquires as necessary to cover all Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer has to withhold or that are legally recoverable from the Team Member (such as fringe benefit tax), unless the Company, in its sole discretion, has established alternative procedures for such payment. If Team Member is categorized as an Officer, then the exclusive procedure for satisfying the Team Member s obligation regarding Tax-Related Items will be Company withholding of Shares from the Shares otherwise issuable to the Team Member as a result of the award vesting, except as specifically approved otherwise by the Committee. However, with respect to any PARSUs subject to Section 409A, the Employer shall limit the surrender of Shares to the minimum number of Shares permitted to avoid a prohibited acceleration under Section 409A. The Team Member will receive a cash refund for any fraction of a surrendered Share or Shares in excess of any and all Tax-Related Items. To the extent that any surrender of Shares or payment of cash or alternative procedure for such payment is insufficient, the Team Member authorizes the Company, its 
 3 

Affiliates and Subsidiaries, which are qualified to deduct tax at source, to deduct from the Team Member s compensation all Tax-Related Items. The Team Member agrees to pay any Tax-Related Items that cannot be satisfied from wages or other cash compensation, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law. 
 
 The Company and or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in the Team Member s jurisdiction(s), in which case the Team Member will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, the Team Member is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested PARSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of the Team Member s participation in the Plan. 
 
 (b) Regardless of any action the Company or the Employer takes with respect to any or all Tax-Related Items, the Team Member acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Team Member s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer, if any. The Team Member further acknowledges that the Company and or the Employer (i) make no representations nor undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of this grant of PARSUs or dividend equivalents, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of PARSUs or dividend equivalents, the subsequent delivery of Shares and or cash upon settlement of such PARSUs or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired pursuant to such PARSUs and receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalent payments and (ii) notwithstanding Section 11, do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms or any aspect of this grant of PARSUs and or dividend equivalents to reduce or eliminate the Team Member s liability for Tax-Related Items or to achieve any particular tax result. Further, if the Team Member has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Team Member acknowledges that the Company and or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. The Team Member shall pay the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Team Member s participation in the Plan or the Team Member s receipt of PARSUs that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver the benefit described in Section 3 if the Team Member fails to comply with the Team Member s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. 
 
 (c) In accepting the PARSUs, the Team Member consents and agrees that in the event the PARSUs or the dividend equivalents become subject to an employer tax that is legally permitted to be recovered from the Team Member, as may be determined by the Company and or the Employer at their sole discretion, and whether or not the Team Member s employment with the Company and or the Employer is continuing at the time such tax becomes recoverable, the Team Member will assume any liability for any such taxes that may be payable by the Company and or the Employer in connection with the PARSUs and dividend equivalents. Further, by accepting the PARSUs, the Team Member agrees that the Company and or the Employer may collect any such taxes from the Team Member by any of the means set forth in this Section 12. The Team Member further agrees to execute any other consents or elections required to accomplish the above, promptly upon request of the Company.

 (d) Further, the Team Member understands that the Team Member is providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY 
 
 DODD-FRANK CLAWBACK POLICY 
 
 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Company has adopted this clawback policy (the Policy as a supplement to any other clawback policies in effect now or in the future at the Company. This Policy shall be interpreted to comply with the clawback rules found in 229 C.F.R. 240.10D and the related listing rules of the national securities exchange or national securities association Exchange on which the Company has listed securities, and, to the extent this Policy is any manner deemed inconsistent with such rules, this Policy shall be treated as retroactively amended to be compliant with such rules. 
 
 1. Definitions . 229 C.F.R. 240.10D-1(d) defines the terms Executive Officer, Financial Reporting Measure(s), Incentive-Based Compensation, and Received. As used herein, these terms shall have the same meaning as in that regulation and the Exchange listing requirements that were adopted pursuant to 229 C.F.R. 240.10D-1. 
 
 2. Application of the Policy . This Policy shall only apply in the event that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, which is an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. 
 
 3. Administration Committee Decisions . This Policy shall be administered by the HR & Compensation Committee (the Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board ). The Committee has full and final authority to make all determinations under this Policy, in each case to the extent permitted under the Exchange s listing rules. All determinations and decisions made by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of this Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company, its affiliates, its stockholders and Executive Officers. Any action or inaction by the Committee with respect to an Executive Officer under this Policy in no way limits the Committee s actions or decisions not to act with respect to any other Executive Officer under this Policy or under any similar policy, agreement or arrangement, nor shall any such action or inaction serve as a waiver of any rights the Company may have against any Executive Officer other than as set forth in this Policy. 
 
 4. Recovery Scope . The Incentive-Based Compensation subject to recovery under this Policy (in the amount determined according to Section 5) is the Incentive-Based Compensation Received during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, provided that it was Received by a person who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period applicable to the Incentive-Based Compensation in question. The date that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement shall be determined pursuant to 229 C.F.R. 240.10D-1(b)(1)(ii). 
 
 (a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Policy shall only apply if the Incentive-Based Compensation is Received (1) while the Company has a class of securities listed on the Exchange and (2) on or after the Effective Date (as defined in Section 9 below). 

(b) See 229 C.F.R. 240.10D-1(b)(1)(i) for certain circumstances under which the Policy will apply to Incentive-Based Compensation received during a transition period arising due to a change in the Company s fiscal year. 
 
 5. Erroneously Awarded Compensation . Of the Incentive-Based Compensation that is in scope pursuant to Section 4, the amount subject to recovery under the Policy Erroneously Awarded Compensation is the amount of such Incentive-Based Compensation Received that exceeds the amount of Incentive Based-Compensation that otherwise would have been Received had it been determined based on the restated amounts and shall be computed without regard to any taxes paid. 
 
 (a) For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement (1) the amount shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received and (2) the Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Exchange. 
 
 6. Recovery Process Exceptions . In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall recover reasonably promptly any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, except to the extent that the conditions of paragraphs (a) or (b) below apply. The Committee shall have the discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation and shall determine the repayment schedule for each amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in a manner that complies with this reasonably promptly requirement. Such determination shall be consistent with any applicable legal guidance, by the Exchange, the SEC, judicial opinion, or otherwise. The determination of reasonably promptly may vary from case to case based on the particular facts and circumstances, and the Committee is authorized to adopt additional rules to further describe what repayment schedules satisfy this requirement. Subject to compliance with any applicable law or Exchange rule, the Company may affect recovery under this Policy from any amount otherwise payable to the Executive Officer, including without limitation base salary, bonuses, incentive awards or commissions and compensation previously deferred by the Executive Officer. 
 
 (a) Erroneously Awarded Compensation need not be recovered if the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered and the Committee has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to the Exchange. 
 
 (b) Erroneously Awarded Compensation need not be recovered if recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the registrant, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder and the Committee has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable. 
 
 7. No Indemnification . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other policy of the Company or any agreement between the Company and an Executive Officer, no Executive Officer shall be indemnified by the Company against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation. 
 
 2 

8. Agreement to Policy by Executive Officers . The Committee shall take reasonable steps to inform Executive Officers of this Policy and obtain their agreement to this Policy, which steps may constitute the inclusion of this Policy as an attachment to any award that is accepted by the Executive Officer. 
 
 9. Effective Date . This Policy shall be effective as of October 2, 2023 (the Effective Date ). The terms of the Policy shall apply to any Incentive-Based Compensation that is Received by Executive Officers on or after the Effective Date, subject to Section 4 above. 
 
 10. Other Policies and Agreements . The Company s recovery right under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment or recovery that may be available to the Company under applicable law, pursuant to the terms of any similar policy or in any provision of any employment agreement, compensatory plan, equity award agreement or similar agreement. To the extent that an Executive Officer has reimbursed the Company for any Erroneously Awarded Compensation (as defined herein) under any other applicable law or regulation or pursuant to a recovery obligation contained in any other policy, employment agreement, compensatory plan, equity award agreement or similar agreement, such reimbursed amount will be credited against the required recovery amount under this Policy. 
 
 11. Amendment Termination . The Committee, may amend, modify, supplement, rescind or replace all or any portion of the Policy at any time and from time to time as it deems necessary to comply with applicable law or any listing rules of the Exchange on which the Company has listed securities.
