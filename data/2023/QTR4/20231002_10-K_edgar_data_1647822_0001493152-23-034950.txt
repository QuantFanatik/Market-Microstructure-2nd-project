can achieve an all-in-one hosting platform from project creation, deployment, operation and maintenance of the whole package. Applied
in the parking industry, it is most suitable for unattended parking management.

booth or computer, reports and real-time monitoring can be viewed in real time through the cloud. One Smart Cloud Box can access up to
48 channels of cameras, in most cases requires only one configuring box for each project. After the front-end license plate is captured,
the box carries out secondary comparison by analyzing the captured photo, and once there is a camera recognition error, it can be corrected
within 200ms, truly achieving 99.9 license plate recognition rate.

Market
Analysis 

Under
the traditional parking management system, China s parking industry has two significant problems: the shortage of parking spaces
and low utilization rate. At present, the average utilization rate of parking spaces in China is about 40 , the larger the scale of the
parking lot, the lower the utilization rate, such as the largest commercial complex parking lot, but the average daily utilization rate
is only 37 , which is lower than the average level of other types of parking lots. Over 90 of cities in China have an overall parking
utilization rate of less than 50 , and the parking utilization rate in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou is in the
range of 40-50 , which is a waste of parking resources. 

Under
the traditional parking space management system, the degree of specialization in parking management is low, the industry is highly fragmented,
and there is a lack of large specialized parking management companies. There are many types of market participants with different standards,
the uneven level of control prevents the centralized management of traditional parking spaces, which further hinders the effective use
of parking spaces and is not conducive to the improvement of parking space utilization. 

In
Beijing, there are 6,581 registered parking lots, but more than 3,000 property management companies and parking lot management companies
are involved in management. The market share of parking spaces of the top four management companies only accounts for 8.5 ; the market
share of the top-ranked parking management company is 4.4 , and the market share of parking spaces is only 1.9 . At the same time, China s
traditional parking management system has a low level of intelligence and management method. 

According
to Sullivan s data, the coverage rate of intelligent parking lots in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen
is less than 10 , and most domestic parking lots still adopt the traditional card and ticket entrance/exit management method,
with manual charging as the main method. The backward management method leads to the problems of slow access, difficulty in finding parking
space and difficulty in finding a car. The length of time and difficulty for car owners to find cars increases with the scale of the
car park. 

For
example, the parking lot of commercial complex is generally large in scale and complex in structure, and the user s search time
is often 4-6 times of the average search time of other types of parking lots (residential, commercial office buildings, transportation
hubs, etc.). The backward management method greatly lengthens the time of occupied parking spaces, hinders the improvement of parking
space turnover rate, and even directly causes poor user parking experience. 

With
the problem of difficult parking becoming more and more prominent, the commercial and social value of the smart parking
industry has also become more and more prominent. Smart parking management mode can effectively improve the utilization of parking resources,
thus alleviating the problem of urban parking difficulties. It is sought after by all social forces (capital, policy, technology, users,
etc.) and can promote the further development of the industry.

China s
smart parking industry has not yet issued a national unified construction standard, the construction of parking information systems in
local cities across the country lacks a unified normative basis, and the smart parking systems built by various office buildings, hotels,
shopping malls, and communities lack integrated planning and architecture specifications, especially for applications in commercial areas
and communities, with significant differences in architecture between systems, leading to difficulties in information exchange and system
integration. There are a large number of smart parking enterprises and derivatives on the market, each smart parking products and service
providers is on their own, the products and systems launched are not compatible with each other. In the smart parking application field,
the market is not yet standardized nationwide via a single parking app, all parking apps information is not incorporated or shared, forming
many singled out information islands, which is against the original intention of revitalizing the market of smart parking. These apps
also have different user experiences, which brings a lot of inconvenience to consumers, and eventually abandoned by many of them, which
is not beneficial to the expansion and popularity of smart parking network. 

In
addition, the development of the industry is not standardized, there are some providers who do not have the resources to research, develop
and provide post-sale services, who end up reducing prices to sell low-quality products. No real competing power, disrupting the market
order, causing quality manufacturers a certain amount of competitive pressure, intensifying a degree of competition in the industry,
which is not favorable to a healthy development of the industry. 

In
the past three years, internet companies have entered the smart parking industry in a big way with capital. in February 2018, Ant Group
under Alibaba took a 200-million-yuan stake in J-Parking. In August of the same year, Tencent made a strategic investment in Xiamen Ketuo
Co. 

Internet
companies have combined their advantages in artificial intelligence, mobile payment and other technologies with smart parking platforms
for strategic cooperation. This strategic cooperation between internet companies and smart parking platforms has made unattended and
sensor less payment the trend of industry development. The mainstream smart parking operation platform has access to Alipay, WeChat payment
and other mobile payment technologies. In May 2018, Baidu and ETCP reached a strategic cooperation, through the parking payment 
page of Baidu Map or the ETCP Parking APP, car owners can check parking information in real time, navigate to the parking
lot, and enjoy smart parking services such as electronic payment for entering and exiting the parking lot without parking, achieving
a harmonious system of shared data and integrated platform. 

Baidu,
Ali, Tencent and other Internet giants have entered the game one after another, not only to provide a solid financial basis for the transformation
of parking services, also the integration of on-line operations and smart parking, which boosts rapid and steady development of the industry,
driving the industry into a new stage of development. As the head enterprises in the smart parking industry accelerate their capital
operation, the industry will accelerate the pace of high-quality parking resources, and will also surge a wave of mergers and acquisitions,
resulting industry integration to be further accelerated. 

According
to some developed countries, the ratio of car to parking spaces is 1:1.3, while the average in China is less than 1:0.5, which is a serious
imbalance between supply and demand, car owners and drivers usually cannot find a parking space after driving out to the destination,
due to the difficulty of finding parking spaces leading to unlawful parking, road congestion, traffic accidents and other problems, bringing
concerns to the government s urban traffic. 

Analysis
from the perspective of the needs of car owners and drivers: This part of the user demand we call C-end user demand, its demand for parking
is extremely urgent and rigid, they hope to be able to check the availability of parking spaces near the destination in advance before
leaving home, you can reserve a parking space in advance. At the same time, as car owners and drivers, they hope that the platform can
provide them with more user-friendly, more detailed and comprehensive services and better experience. 

Analysis
from the perspective of different parking space owners and operators: They want to realize unattended and automated payments; they want
to reduce operating costs and improve operational efficiency; they want to realize intelligent and digital management and turn their
resources into their digital assets. 

Analysis
from the perspective of city planners: They want to have a software, a system and a platform to integrate the parking spaces of different
property rights in the whole city, to achieve data integration and sharing, and to realize real-time data update, query, regulation and
scheduling. 

Analysis
from the perspective of the state, to promote the industry and industrial development: The smart parking industry covers a wide range,
long industry chain, the state hopes to have a comprehensive digital, industry-wide platform for industry resource integration and information
sharing, in order to promote the development of the whole industry.

from sale of property and equipment of 2,848,949 for the year ended May 31, 2023 compared to net cash flows provided by investing activities

and equipment of 938,482 and a purchase of property and equipment of 2,554,572. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

We
have financed our operations primarily from either capital contributions or financial instruments. For the year ended May 31, 2023, net
cash provided by financing activities was 1,913,012 consisting mainly of proceeds from long-term borrowings of 1,814,559 and repayments
of long-term borrowings of 598,748. For the year ended May 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was 16,904,719 consisting
primarily of proceeds from paid in capital of 7,019,564 and long-term loan of 10,166,910. 

Going
Concern Consideration 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon long-term loans related to Shaoxing Keqiao Zhuyi Technology Co. and the director
(Guowei Zhang) to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. These
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern 

These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation
as a going concern is dependent on long term loans related to Shaoxing Keqiao Zhuyi Technology Co. and the director (Guowei Zhang) to
meet obligations as they become due and to obtain additional equity or alternative financing required to fund operations until sufficient
sources of recurring revenues can be generated. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its plans described
above or in attracting equity or alternative financing on acceptable terms, or if at all. The consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the
Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Contractual
Obligations 

As
a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information. 

17 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We
prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments.
We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important
at the time the condensed financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies and how they are applied
and disclosed in our condensed financial statements. 

While
we believe that the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material 

Impact
of Inflation 

In
accordance with the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the year-over-year percentage changes in the consumer price index for March
2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 were 2.3 , 4.3 , 4.4 and 2 , respectively. Inflation in China has not materially affected our profitability
and operating results. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be unaffected by higher inflation rates in China in the future. 

Foreign
Currency Exchange Rates 

We
are not materially affected by foreign currency exchange rates. However, it is difficult to predict how market forces, or PRC or U.S.
government policy, might affect our operations. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a substantial
liberalization of its currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant change in the value of the RMB against the
U.S. dollar. Limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. So far, we have
not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we potentially
may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be
limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. Furthermore, our currency exchange losses may be magnified
by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currency.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To:
 
 The
 Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

SavMobi
 Technology Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of SavMobi Technology Inc. (the Company) as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flow for year ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, and the result of its operations and its cash flow
for the year then ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Explanatory
Paragraph Regarding Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
3 to the financial statements, the Company had incurred substantial losses during the year, and has a working capital deficit, which
raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regards to these matters are described
in Note 3. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

1. The
 Company conducted transactions with its related parties and affiliates during the normal
 course of its business in 2023. The Company has entered into a number of transactions with
 these related parties, including director remuneration which represented as costs and expenses
 to the Company. We identified the evaluation of the identification of related parties and
 related party transactions as a critical audit matter. Auditor judgment was involved in assessing
 the sufficiency of the procedures performed to identify related parties and related party
 transactions of the Company. 

19 

How
the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

We
performed the following procedures to evaluate the identification of related parties and related party transactions by the Company: 

Conducted
 background checks, and reviewed other public research sources for information related to transactions between the Company and its
 related parties 

Performed
 confirmations for account balances with related parties 

Reviewed
 transaction details in the accounts payable system for transactions with related parties 

Examined
 the Company s reconciliation of its related parties transactions and balances 

Tested
 expenses transactions between the Company and its related parties 

2. As
 described in Note 3, for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company reported
 accumulated deficit of 23,887,645 and 18,433,688 and a working capital deficiency/(equity)
 of 784,107 and 3,609,189), respectively. The Company s operations are mainly funded
 with debt financing, which is dependent upon many external factors and may be difficult to
 raise when required. The Company may not have sufficient cash to fund its operations, and
 therefore, will require additional funding, which if not raised, may result in the delay,
 postponement or curtailment of some or all of its activities. Management has prepared future
 cash flow forecasts, which involves judgement and estimation of key variables, such as planned
 expenditures, future financings and market conditions. 

We
identified the Company s ability to continue as a going concern as a critical audit matter because auditing the Company s
going concern assessment is complex and involves a high degree of auditor judgment to assess the reasonableness of the cash flow forecasts,
planned refinancing actions and other assumptions used in the Company s going concern analysis. The Company s ability to
execute the planned refinancing actions are especially judgmental given that the global financial markets. 

This
matter is also described in the Explanatory Paragraph Regarding Going Concern section of our report. 

How
the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

We
responded to this matter by performing procedures over management s assessment of the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern. Our audit work in relation to this included, but was not restricted to, the following: 

We
 inquired with management whether there is substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern; 

We
 have received the confirmation of financial support from the long term loan creditor and company director, indicating their willingness
 to continue supporting the company on the next twelve months. 

We
 reviewed the related financial statement disclosure in the notes to the financial statements to ensure they are adequate.

are entitled to terminate the agreements in writing. Unless otherwise required by PRC Laws, the VIEs shall not unilaterally terminate
this agreement. 

Equity
Pledge Agreement 

Pursuant
to the equity pledge agreements among the WFOEs, the VIEs and their respective Nominee Shareholders, the Nominee Shareholders of the
VIEs pledged all of their respective equity interests in the VIEs to the WFOEs as collaterals for performance of the obligations of the
VIEs and their Nominee Shareholders under the exclusive business cooperation agreements, the power of attorney agreements, and the exclusive
option agreements. The Nominee Shareholders of the VIEs also undertake that, during the term of the equity pledge agreements, unless
otherwise approved by the WFOEs in writing, they will not transfer the pledged equity interests or create or allow any new pledge or
other encumbrance on the pledged equity interests. These equity pledge agreements remain in force until VIEs and their respective Nominee
Shareholders discharge all their obligations under the contractual agreements. 

Spousal
Consent Letter 

Pursuant
to the spousal consent letters, the spouses of some of the individual Nominee Shareholders of the VIEs unconditionally and irrevocably
agree that the equity interest in the VIEs held by and registered in the name of his or her respective spouse will be disposed of pursuant
to the relevant exclusive business cooperation agreements, equity pledge agreements, the exclusive option agreements and the power of
attorney agreements, without his or her consent. In addition, each of them agrees not to assert any rights over the equity interest in
the VIEs held by their respective spouses. In addition, in the event that any of them obtains any equity interest in the VIEs held by
their respective spouses for any reason, such spouses agree to be bound by similar obligations and agreed to enter into similar contractual
arrangements. 

b.
Risks in relation to the VIE structure 

On
March 15, 2019, the National People s Congress adopted the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, which became effective on January
1, 2020, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The Foreign Investment Law does not explicitly classify
contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment, but it contains a catch-all provision under the definition of foreign
investment , which includes investments made by foreign investors through means stipulated in laws or administrative regulations
or other methods prescribed by the State Council. It is unclear whether the Group s corporate structure will be seen as violating
the foreign investment rules as the Group is currently leveraging the contractual arrangements to operate certain business in which foreign
investors are prohibited from or restricted to investing. If variable interest entities fall within the definition of foreign investment
entities, the Group s ability to use the contractual arrangements with its VIEs and the Group s ability to conduct business
through the VIEs could be severely limited. 

If
the PRC government otherwise finds that the Group in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations or lacks the necessary
permits or licenses to operate the business, the Group s relevant PRC regulatory authorities could: 

revoke the business licenses and/or operating licenses of the Group s PRC entities; 

impose fines; 

confiscate any income that they deem to be obtained through illegal operations, or impose other requirements with which the Group may
not be able to comply; 

discontinue or place restrictions or onerous conditions on the Group s operations; 

place restrictions on the right to collect revenues; 

require the Group to restructure ownership structure or operations, including terminating the contractual agreements with the VIEs and
deregistering the equity pledges of the VIEs, which in turn would affect the ability to consolidate the financial results of and derive
economic interests from the VIEs and their subsidiaries; 

restrict or prohibit the use of the proceeds from financing activities to finance the business and operations of the VIEs and their subsidiaries;
or 

take other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful to the Group s business. 

The
imposition of any of these penalties may result in a material and adverse effect on the Group s ability to conduct the Group s
business. In addition, if the imposition of any of these penalties causes the Group to lose the rights to direct the activities of the
VIEs or the right to receive its economic benefits, the Group would no longer be able to consolidate the VIEs. The management believes
that the likelihood for the Group to lose such ability is remote based on current facts and circumstances. However, the interpretation
and implementation of the laws and regulations in the PRC and their application to an effect on the legality, binding effect and enforceability
of contracts are subject to the discretion of competent PRC authorities, and therefore there is no assurance that relevant PRC authorities
will take the same position as the Group herein in respect of the legality, binding effect and enforceability of each of the contractual
arrangements. Meanwhile, since the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, it may lead to changes in PRC laws, regulations and
policies or in the interpretation and application of existing laws, regulations and policies, which may limit legal protections available
to the Group to enforce the contractual arrangements should the VIEs or the Nominee Shareholders of the VIEs fail to perform their obligations
under those arrangements. The enforceability, and therefore the benefits, of the contractual agreements between the Company and the VIEs
depend on Nominee Shareholders enforcing the contracts. There is a risk that Nominee shareholders of VIEs, who in some cases are also
shareholders of the Company may have conflict of interests with the Company in the future or fail to perform their contractual obligations.
Given the significance and importance of the VIEs, there would be a significant negative impact to the Company if these contracts were
not enforced. 

The
Group s operations depend on the VIEs to honor their contractual agreements with the Group. The Company s ability to direct
activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and the Company s right to receive the economic
benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIEs depend on the authorization by the shareholders of the VIEs to exercise voting
rights on all matters requiring shareholder approval in the VIEs. The Company believes that the agreements on authorization to exercise
shareholder s voting power are enforceable against each party thereto in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws or
regulations currently in effect and the possibility that it will no longer be able to consolidate the VIEs as a result of the aforementioned
risks and uncertainties is remote.

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon long-term loans related to Shaoxing Keqiao Zhuyi Technology Co. and the director
(Guowei Zhang) to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. These
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation
as a going concern is dependent on long term loans related to Shaoxing Keqiao Zhuyi Technology Co. and the director (Guowei Zhang) to
meet obligations as they become due and to obtain additional equity or alternative financing required to fund operations until sufficient
sources of recurring revenues can be generated. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its plans described
above or in attracting equity or alternative financing on acceptable terms, or if at all. The consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

 of the ownership interest of Intellegence was exchanged for 
shares of common stock of SVMB issued to the Shareholders, in accordance with the Share Exchange Agreement. The former stockholders of
Intellegence will acquire a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock as a result of the share exchange transaction. The transaction
has been accounted for as a recapitalization of the Company, whereby Intellegence is the accounting acquirer. 

Immediately
after completion of such share exchange, SVMB will hold a total of issued and outstanding shares of Intellegence. Zhang Guowei
is the sole director of Intellegence Parking Group Limited. 

SVMB
and Intellegence consolidated the financial statements through common control. As a result, the Company measured the recognized assets
and liabilities combined at their historical cost at the acquisition date. The difference between consideration paid and assets and liabilities
received are presented as a component of equity and additional paid-in-capital. 

Zhejiang
Jingbo Ecological Technology and Hangzhou Zhuyi, Linglingyi, Lingshan, Anping, Haikou, Yibin, Xide Tongpo and Taining consolidated the
financial statements through acquisition. 

Jingbo
accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 Business
Combinations . The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the assets transferred
to the sellers, liabilities incurred by Jingbo and equity instruments issued by Jingbo. Transaction costs directly attributable to the
acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured separately at their fair values
as of the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interests. The excess of (i) the total costs of acquisition,
fair value of the non-controlling interests and acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over
(ii) the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the
fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated statements of comprehensive
loss. 

In
a business combination achieved in stages, Jingbo re-measures the previously held equity interest in the acquiree immediately before
obtaining control at its acquisition date fair value and the re-measurement gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statements
of comprehensive loss. 

The
consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Jingbo its subsidiaries, the VIEs and VIE s subsidiaries
for which the Company is considered the ultimate primary beneficiary for accounting purposes. 

A
subsidiary is an entity in which the Company directly or indirectly controls more than one half of the voting power, has the power to
appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors, to cast a majority of notes at the meeting of the board of directors
or to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee under a statute or agreement among the shareholders or equity holders. 

A
VIE is an entity in which the Company s subsidiary, through contractual agreements, has the power to direct activities of the VIEs
that most significantly impact their economic performance, and has the right to receive economic benefits from the VIEs that could potentially
be significant to them, and therefore the Company is considered the ultimate primary beneficiary of the entity for accounting purposes. 

All
transactions and balances among the Company, its subsidiaries, the VIEs and VIEs subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation.
The results of subsidiaries and VIEs acquired or disposed of during the year are recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive
loss from the effective dates of acquisition or up to the effective dates of disposal, as appropriate.

The
cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts, and any gain or loss
are included in the Company s results of operations. The costs of maintenance and repairs are recognized to expenses as incurred;
significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. 

All
other leases are accounted for as operating leases wherein rental payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the periods of
their respective leases. Operating leases (with an initial term of more than 12 months) are included in operating lease right-of-use ROU assets, operating lease liabilities (current), and operating lease liabilities (non-current) in the balance sheets.
ROU assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company s
obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date
based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company utilizes a market-based approach to estimate the incremental
borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating
lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The lease terms may include options to extend or
terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. 

The
Company reviews its lease for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
no longer be recoverable. Whenever there is an indication showing a permanent decrease in the amount of lease; such as an evidence of
obsolescence or physical damage of an asset, significant changes in the manner in which an asset is used or is expected to be used, the
Company shall recognize loss on decrease in value of lease in the statement of income where the carrying amount of asset is higher than
the recoverable amount. The Company measures impairment by comparing the carrying value of the lease to the estimated discounted future
cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected discounted cash flow
is less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Company would recognize an impairment loss based on the fair value of the assets

The

assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets have
not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as required
by Sarbanes- Oxley (SOX) Section 404 A. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the
supervision of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal
control over financial reporting established in SEC guidance on conducting such assessments as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Management conducted the assessment based on certain criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal
controls over financial reporting were not effective as of May 31,2023. 

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company s management considered to be material weaknesses under the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: 1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of
outside directors on the Company s board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of
required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient
written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and
SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned
material weaknesses were identified by the Company s Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements
as of May 31, 2023 and communicated the matters to our management. 

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2), (3) and (4) above did not have an effect on the Company s financial
results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the
Company s board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls
and procedures can result in the Company s determination to its financial statements for the future years. 

We
are committed to improving our financial organization. As part of this commitment, we will create a position to segregate duties consistent
with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when
funds are available to the Company: i) Appointing one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the
audit committee of the Company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment
and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and ii) Preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists
which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and
SEC disclosure requirements. 

46 

Management
believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy
the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company s Board. In addition, management
believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i)
insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application
of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further,
management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation
of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department. Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed
to support the Company if personnel turn over issues within the department occur. This coupled with the appointment of additional outside
directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future. 

We
will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial
reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as
necessary and as funds allow. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s
report in this annual report. 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Rules 13a- 15 or 15d- 15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the small business issuer s last fiscal year that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Director
Compensation 

The
Board of Directors of the Company has not adopted a stock option plan. The Company has no plans to adopt it but may choose to do so in
the future. If such a plan is adopted, this may be administered by the board or a committee appointed by the board (the Committee ).
The committee would have the power to modify, extend or renew outstanding options and to authorize the grant of new options in substitution
therefore, provided that any such action may not impair any rights under any option previously granted. SavMobi Technology Inc. may develop
an incentive-based stock option plan for its officers and directors and may reserve up to 10 of its outstanding shares of common stock

financial expert on our Board of Directors. We believe that an audit committee financial expert is not required because the cost of hiring
an audit committee financial expert to act as one of our directors and to be a member of an Audit Committee outweighs the benefits of
having an audit committee financial expert at this time.

accountants for professional services rendered in connection with the audit of our May 31, 2023 and 2022 financial statements and for
the reviews of our financial statements for the quarters ended during such periods. 

The
SEC requires that before our independent registered public accounting firm is engaged by us to render any auditing or permitted non-audit
related service, the engagement be either: (i) approved by our Audit Committee or (ii) entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies
and procedures established by the Audit Committee, provided that the policies and procedures are detailed as to the particular service,
the Audit Committee is informed of each service, and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of the Audit Committee s
responsibilities to management. 

We
do not have an Audit Committee. Our Board pre-approves all services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm.
