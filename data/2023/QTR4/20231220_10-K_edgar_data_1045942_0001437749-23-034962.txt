Our telephone number is (877) 260-2010. We maintain a corporate website at www.trackgrp.com. Our common stock, par value 0.0001 per share Common Stock ), is currently listed for quotation on the OTCQB Venture Markets OTCQB under the symbol TRCK . Unless specified otherwise, as used in this Annual Report, references to Track Group, Inc. include the Company and its subsidiaries: Track Group Americas, Inc., a Utah corporation; Track Group Puerto Rico, Inc., a Puerto Rico corporation; Emerge Monitoring, Inc., a Florida corporation; Emerge Monitoring II LLC, a Florida limited liability company; Integrated Monitoring Systems, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company; Track Group Chile S.p.A, a corporation formed under the laws of the Republic of Chile; Track Group Analytics Limited, a corporation formed under the laws of Canada; and Track Group International Ltd., a company formed under the laws of Israel (collectively, the Subsidiaries ). 

Company Background 

The Company designs, manufactures, and markets location tracking devices and develops and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions, and monitoring applications. Our products and services include a full-range of one-piece GPS tracking devices, a device-agnostic operating system, a portfolio of software applications including smartphone, alcohol and predictive analytics, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. Our products and services are currently available worldwide and are sold through our direct sales force, as well as through value-added resellers. The Company sells to government customers on federal, state and local levels in the U.S. and to members of the Ministry of Justice MOJ internationally. Track Group s device-agnostic platform and expanded portfolio of integrated and complimentary monitoring-related services help reduce risk and make the administration of justice better, faster, and less expensive for taxpayers. 

Business Strategy 

We are committed to helping our customers improve offender rehabilitation and re-socialization outcomes through our innovative hardware, software and services. We treat our business as a service business. Although we still manufacture patented tracking technology, we see the physical goods as only a small part of the integrated offender monitoring solutions we provide. Accordingly, rather than receiving a payment just for a piece of manufactured equipment, the Company receives a recurring stream of revenue for ongoing device agnostic subscription contracts. As part of our strategy, we continue to expand our device-agnostic platform to not only collect, but also store, analyze, assess and correlate location data for both accountability and auditing reasons, as well as to use for predictive analytics and assessment of effective and emerging techniques in criminal behavior and rehabilitation. We believe a high-quality customer experience along with knowledgeable salespeople who can convey the value of our products and services greatly enhances our ability to attract and retain customers. Therefore, our strategy also includes building and expanding our own direct sales force and our third-party distribution network to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a world-class sales and post-sales support experience. In addition, we are developing related-service offerings to address adjacent market opportunities in both the public and private sectors. We believe continual investment in research and development R D ), including smartphone applications and other monitoring services is critical to the development and sale of innovative technologies and integrated solutions today and in the future. 

Recent Developments 

On April 26, 2023, the Company and Conrent entered into an amendment to the facility agreement (the Amendment originally executed by and between the parties on December 30, 2013 and amended multiple times (the Amended Facility Agreement ).

The facilities have redundant power sources, battery backup and triple redundancy in voice, data and IP. We have assisted in the establishment of monitoring centers for customers and local partners in the United States, Chile and other global locations. 

Customer Care 

We offer a range of support options for our customers. These include assistance that is built into software products, printed and electronic product manuals, in-person training, online support including comprehensive product information, as well as technical assistance. 

Research and Development Program 

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 Fiscal 2023 ), we incurred research and development expenses of 2,735,060, as compared to 2,432,448 recognized during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 Fiscal 2022 ). The 302,612 increase in research and development was largely due to higher wages and payroll taxes of 298,846. The Company has now significantly enhanced its technology platform to improve the efficiency of its software, firmware, user interface, and automation and invested considerable time in developing a new device expected to be completed in calendar 2024. As a result of these improvements, 1,020,604 and 865,263 was capitalized as developed technology, in accordance with the accounting guidance for internal-use software, during Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, respectively. 

Competition 

The markets for our products and services are highly competitive and we are confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of our business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and technological advances. Our competitors selling tracking devices have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. Our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to us include price, product features, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong software ecosystem, service and support, and corporate reputation. 

Our specific competitors vary from market to market and we compete against other international, national and regional companies, some of whom use local partners that may have more knowledge of the local markets and the government decision-making process. Some of our competitors are owned by large public companies with broader resources, while others are backed by private equity firms with large funds, or in some cases, work as part of a consortium with extensive international experience. We expect competition in these markets to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of our products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with third-party providers to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.

Table of Contents 

Competitive Strengths 

Relationships with High-Quality Government Customers. We have developed strong relationships with federal, state and county customers within the United States and with Ministries of Justice internationally and managed to bring in new, sizable customers in the past year. 

Industry Leading Analytics Software. Our software remains a leader with fully functioning, revenue-generating analytics on the market today, specifically designed for the offender monitoring market . State departments of corrections, county probation agencies and sheriff s offices have utilized this solution for multiple years. 

Device Agnostic Software Platform. Our software platform is device agnostic and currently accommodates offender monitoring with new products that we introduce, integrates with case management software utilized by sheriff, probation and pre-trial departments, and supports devices manufactured by competitors. 

Smartphone Monitoring Pioneers in Criminal Justice. Today s prison system incarcerates too many individuals who pose little threat to public safety, at far too great a cost. They serve their sentences in overcrowded, outdated institutions that expose them to hardened criminals. Upon release, their opportunities and lives have changed forever. Now, low-risk offender populations can serve their sentences virtually, holding jobs and taking care of family members, yet still feeling the weight of their punishment while seeing a clear path to avoiding trouble in the future. Further, taxpayers gain a clear cost advantage. To date, we have developed apps targeting alcohol monitoring, domestic violence and our core monitoring platform. 

Experienced Senior Management Team. Our top executives have extensive experience in both the offender monitoring marketplace and their specific fields of expertise, whether that be sales, customer care and/or technology. We also benefit from a diverse and experienced Board of Directors. 

Recurring Revenue. Our revenue is generated in large part by long-term customer contracts based on the size of the offender monitoring program throughout each month, which creates a predictable, recurring revenue stream. 

Extensive Product Suite. We have a large variety of products that appeal to a broad range of government customers and greatly enhance our ability to attract and retain clients. These products include different GPS devices, alcohol monitoring devices and applications, and new smartphone applications including those that address adjacent market opportunities in both the public and private sectors and analytics software. 

National Footprint with International Presence. We operate in approximately 40 states (including Washington DC and Puerto Rico) as well as select international locations, including Chile, and Saudi Arabia and Bahamas. Our presence both within the United States and abroad better positions us to compete for new and expiring government contracts. 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

We use various suppliers and contract manufacturers to supply parts and components for the manufacture and support of our product lines. Although our intention is to establish at least two sources of supply for materials whenever possible, for certain components we have sole or limited source supply arrangements. We may not be able to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices and quality within a reasonable time, or at all; therefore, the risk of loss or interruption of such arrangements could impact our ability to deliver certain products on a timely basis. 

The industry in which the Company operates continues to be impacted by the global semiconductor shortage initially caused by the slowdown of many chip makers and logistics companies due to COVID-19. However, the issues have lessened significantly and the Company has been able to purchase most components within reasonable lead times. See Item 1A Risk Factors. 

Dependence on Major Customers 

We had sales to two entities that each represent 10 or more of our gross revenue, as follows, for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively:

Dependence on Major Suppliers 

We purchase cellular services from several major suppliers. The cost to us for these services during Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 was 1,569,639 and 2,063,075, respectively. The 24 decrease in cellular service expense in Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022 was largely the result of lower sales volume and lower negotiated pricing. 

During Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, we also purchased a significant portion of our monitoring equipment from certain suppliers. The cost of these purchases during Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 was 3,503,515 and 2,187,774, respectively. The increase in monitoring equipment was largely due to the replacement of all 3G devices with 4G LTE devices in the U.S. 

Intellectual Property 

We currently hold rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of our hardware devices, accessories, software and services. We have registered or applied for trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although we believe the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel. 

We file patent applications as needed to protect innovations arising from our research, development and design, and are currently pursuing numerous patent applications around the world. Over time, we have accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents around the world. We hold copyrights relating to certain aspects of our products and services. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting our products. We believe that the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. 

Many of our products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, processes and services. Although we have generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses can be obtained in the future on reasonable terms, or at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which we compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties; however, no such notices have been received in the last two fiscal years. 

Trademarks. We have developed and use trademarks in our business, particularly relating to our corporate and product names. We own seven trademarks that are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, plus one trademark registered in Mexico and one in Canada. In addition, we have the Track Group trademark and design registered in various countries around the world. 

We will file additional applications for the registration of our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions as our business expands under current and planned distribution arrangements. Protection of registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection provided by registration in the United States.

Trade Secrets . We own certain intellectual property, including trade secrets, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties. Even where these agreements exist, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors. 

We intend to protect our legal rights concerning intellectual property by all appropriate legal action. Consequently, we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights. Any patent litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel. 

Government Regulation 

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. 

Currently, we are not involved in any pending or, to our knowledge, threatened governmental proceedings, which would require curtailment of our operations because of such laws and regulations. 

Seasonality 

Given the consistency in recurring domestic monitoring revenue by customers throughout Fiscal 2023, we detected no material seasonality in our business. However, as in previous years, incremental domestic device deployment opportunities typically slow down in the months of July and August. We believe this is due to the unavailability of judicial and corrections officials who observe a traditional vacation season during this period. In addition, the operation in Chile generally slows around Christmas time due to the courts willingness to permit offenders being monitored to visit family. 

Employees 

As of December 1, 2023, we had 162 full-time employees and 5 part-time employees. None of the employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a work stoppage and management believes that relations with employees are good.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Our business is subject to significant risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and related notes, before you decide to invest in our Common Stock. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us; however, they may not be the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligations to update any risk factors. 

Risks Related to Our Business, Operations and Industry 

We face risks related to our substantial indebtedness, including risk related to the repayment of our indebtedness. 

As of September 30, 2023, excluding deferred financing costs, we had 43,247,660 of indebtedness outstanding, of which 322,915 becomes due and payable within the next 12 months, 60,745 matures in 2025, 0 matures in 2026 and 42,864,000 matures in 2027. We have 438,165 of interest accrued at September 30, 2023 related to our outstanding indebtedness. Our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, make interest payments as they come due, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our outstanding debt instruments. See Recent Developments and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Our high degree of leverage could have adverse consequences to us, including: 

making it more difficult for us to make payments on our debt; 

increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; 

requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; 

restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; 

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and 

limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less highly leveraged. 

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. 

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. While we are currently reviewing all options regarding our indebtedness, no assurances can be given that we will be successful in refinancing, extending or restructuring the debt, and we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. 

-8-

Table of Contents 

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. 

These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity difficulties and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or the proceeds that we realize from them may not be adequate to meet the debt service obligations then due. 

There is no certainty that the market will continue to accept or expand the use of our products and services. 

Our targeted markets may be slow to, or may never, expand the use of our products or services. Governmental organizations may not use our products unless they determine, based on experience, advertising or other factors, that our products are a preferable alternative to other available methods of tracking or incarceration. In addition, decisions to adopt new tracking devices can be influenced by government administrators, regulatory factors, and other factors largely outside of our control. No assurance can be given that key decision-makers will continue to accept or expand the use of our products, and if they do not, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Budgetary issues faced by government agencies could adversely impact our future revenue. 

Our revenue is primarily derived from contracts with state, local and county government agencies in the United States and governments of Caribbean and Latin American nations. Many of these government agencies are experiencing budget deficits and may continue to do so. As a result, we may experience delays in payment on customer invoices, the amount spent by our current clients on equipment and services that we supply may be reduced or grow at rates slower than anticipated, and it may be more difficult to attract additional government clients. In light of the recent hurricanes, and the destruction sustained by many Caribbean countries, this is of increasing risk. Furthermore, the industry has experienced a general decline in average daily lease rates for GPS tracking devices. As a result of these factors, our ability to maintain or increase our revenue may be negatively affected. 

We rely on significant suppliers for key products and cellular access. If we do not renew these agreements when they expire, we may not continue to have access to these suppliers products or services at favorable prices or in volumes as we have in the past, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. 

We have entered into agreements with several national providers for cellular services. We also currently rely on a single source for the large majority of the manufacturing of our devices. If any of these significant suppliers were to cease providing products or services to us, we would be required to seek alternative sources. No assurances can be given that alternate sources could be located or that the delay or additional expense associated with locating alternative sources for these products or services would not materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. 

Our research, development, marketing and export activities are subject to government regulations. The cost of compliance or the failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

There can be no assurance that changes in the legal or regulatory framework or other subsequent developments will not result in limitation, suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals granted to us. Any such events, were they to occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are required to comply with regulations for manufacturing and export practices, which mandate procedures for extensive control and documentation of product design, control and validation of the manufacturing process and overall product quality. If we, our management, or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations regarding these manufacturing practices, we could be subject to a number of sanctions, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of market approval, seizures or recalls of product, operating restrictions and in some cases, criminal prosecutions. 

We face intense competition, including competition from entities that are more established and may have greater financial resources than we do, which may make it difficult for us to establish and maintain a viable market presence. 

Our current and expected markets are rapidly changing. Although we believe our technology has advantages over competing systems, there can be no assurance that those advantages are significant. Many of our competitors have products or techniques approved or in development and operate large, well-funded research and development programs in the field. Moreover, competitors may be in the process of developing technology that could be developed more quickly or ultimately be more effective than our products. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not develop more effective or more affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization.

We are dependent upon certain customers, the loss of which may adversely affect our results of operations and business condition. 

During Fiscal 2023, our two top customers accounted for an aggregate of 31 of total sales. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event any of our top customers were to terminate their agreements with the Company, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 

Our business plan is subject to the risks of technological uncertainty, which may result in our products failing to be competitive or readily accepted by our target markets. 

There can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will be successful. In addition, the technology that we integrate or that we may expect to integrate with our product and service offerings is rapidly changing and developing. We face risks associated with the possibility that our technology may not function as intended and the possible obsolescence of our technology and the risks of delay in the further development of our own technologies. Cellular coverage is not uniform throughout our current and targeted markets. GPS technology depends upon line-of-sight access to satellite signals used to locate the user, which, under some circumstances, may limit the effectiveness of GPS tracking. In addition, the telecommunications industry continually updates its networks and technology which then requires the Company to update its devices to ensure compatibility with the new networks as is happening with the phase out of 3G cellular networks in the US. 

We face risks of litigation and regulatory investigation and actions in connection with our operations. 

Lawsuits, including regulatory actions, may seek recovery of large, indeterminate amounts or otherwise limit our operations, and their existence and magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Relevant authorities in the markets in which we operate may investigate us in the future. These investigations may result in significant penalties in multiple jurisdictions, and we may become involved in disputes with private parties seeking compensation for damages resulting from the relevant violations. Such legal liability or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and credibility. In addition, our business activities are subject to various governmental regulations in countries where we operate, which include investment approvals, export regulations, tariffs, antitrust, anti-bribery, intellectual property, consumer and business taxation, foreign trade, exchange controls, and environmental and recycling requirements. These regulations limit, and other new or amended regulations may further limit, our business activities or increase operating costs. In addition, the enforcement of such regulations, including the imposition of fines or surcharges for violation of such regulations, may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and credibility. 

Our products are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the protection of intellectual property and related proprietary rights. 

We believe that our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patents, maintain trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, both in the United States and in other countries. Our inability to obtain or to maintain patents on our key products could adversely affect our business. We currently own 21 patents issued and have filed and may file additional patent applications in the United States and in key foreign jurisdictions relating to our technologies, improvements to those technologies, and for specific products we may develop. There can be no assurance that patents will issue on any of these applications or that, if issued, any patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. The enforcement of patent rights can be uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. The scope and enforceability of patent claims are not systematically predictable with absolute accuracy. The strength of our own patent rights depends, in part, upon the breadth and scope of protection provided by the patent and the validity of our patents, if any. 

Our success will also depend, in part, on our ability to avoid infringing the patent rights of others. We must also avoid any material breach of technology licenses we may enter into with respect to our new products and services. Existing patent and license rights may require us to alter the designs of our products or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. If patents have been issued to others that contain competitive or conflicting claims and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid and superior to our own, we may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology. If any licenses are required, there can be no assurance given that we will be able to obtain any necessary licenses on commercially favorable terms, if at all. Any breach of an existing license or failure to obtain a license to any technology that may be necessary in order to commercialize our products may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We also rely on trade secrets laws to protect portions of our technology for which patent protection has not yet been pursued or is not believed to be appropriate or obtainable. These laws may protect us against the unlawful or unpermitted disclosure of any information of a confidential and proprietary nature, including but not limited to our know-how, trade secrets, methods of operation, names and information relating to vendors or suppliers, and customer names and addresses. We seek to protect this un-patentable and unpatented proprietary technology and processes, in addition to other confidential and proprietary information in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, collaborative partners, consultants, and certain contractors. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered or reverse-engineered by competitors. 

We conduct business internationally with a variety of sovereign governments. 

Our business is subject to a variety of regulations and political interests that could affect the timing of payment for services and the duration of our contracts. We face the risk of systems interruptions and capacity constraints, possibly resulting in adverse publicity, revenue loss and erosion of customer trust. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our network infrastructure are critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers and to maintain adequate customer service levels. In addition, because our customers in these foreign jurisdictions are sovereign governments or governmental departments or agencies, it may be difficult for us to enforce our agreements with them in the event of a breach of those agreements, including, but not limited to, the failure to pay for services rendered or to complete projects that we have commenced. 

Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations . 

The rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on several factors, including general economic conditions in the US and abroad. These factors include overall business and consumer demand for a variety of goods and services, credit availability, interest rates, inflation rates, corporate profitability, equity and foreign exchange markets, the number of bankruptcies, and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. The trends and volatility of these economic factors will determine the stability and predictability of economic and market conditions. These conditions will affect the rate of information technology and government spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our services, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their contracts or affect renewal rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. 

Our business is subject to risks arising from epidemic diseases, such as the recent global outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted worldwide economic activity. A pandemic, including COVID-19 or another public health epidemic, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that COVID-19 had, or could have, on our business, the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including impairing our ability to raise capital when needed. In addition, for a period of time we were under a shelter-in-place mandate which may be reinstated at the discretion of state or local authorities and many of our clients worldwide may be similarly impacted. 

Climate change, and related legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, may adversely impact our business. 

There is increasing concern that a gradual rise in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe, an increase in the frequency, severity, and duration of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, and water scarcity and poor water quality. These events could adversely impact the delivery of raw materials required for our products, disrupt the operation of our supply chain and the productivity of our contract manufacturers, increase our production costs, impose capacity restraints and impact the purchases of our products and services. These events could also compound adverse economic conditions and impact consumer confidence and governmental budgets. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In many countries, governmental bodies are enacting new or additional legislation and regulations to reduce or mitigate the potential impacts of climate change. If we, our suppliers, or our contract manufacturers are required to comply with these laws and regulations, or if we choose to take voluntary steps to reduce or mitigate our impact on climate change, we may experience increased costs for energy, production, transportation, and raw materials, increased capital expenditures, or increased insurance premiums and deductibles, which could adversely impact our operations. Inconsistency of legislation and regulations among jurisdictions may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Any assessment of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulations or industry standards, as well as any international treaties and accords, is uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in the countries in which we operate.

Our results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover and labor cost increases. 

Labor is a component of operating our business. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs from time to time, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, and other government regulations. Although we have not experienced any material disruptions due to labor shortages to date, we have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to complete our construction projects according to the required schedule or otherwise efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. 

Additionally, our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local employment-related laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, the Family Medical Leave Act, overtime pay, compensable time, recordkeeping and other working conditions, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the National Labor Relations Act, regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, regulations of the Office of Civil Rights, regulations of the Department of Labor, regulations of state attorneys general, federal and state wage and hour laws, and a variety of similar laws enacted by the federal and state governments that govern these and other employment-related matters. As our employees are located in a number of states, compliance with these evolving federal, state and local laws and regulations, including increases in federal or state minimum wage laws, could substantially increase our cost of doing business while failure to do so could subject us to fines and lawsuits. 

An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation, increase in federal or state minimum wages, or increase in general labor costs, caused by prolonged COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could have a material adverse impact on our operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. 

The global semiconductor shortage could impact the Company s future results. 

The industry in which the Company operates, as well as many other industries (automotive, consumer products and medical devices), have been impacted by the global semiconductor shortage initially caused by the slowdown of many chip makers and logistics companies due to COVID-19. However, the issues have lessened significantly and the Company has been able to purchase most components within reasonable lead times. 

We may experience temporary service interruptions for a variety of reasons, including telecommunications or power failures, fire, water damage, vandalism, civil unrest, computer bugs or viruses, malicious cyber-attacks or hardware failures. 

Any service interruption that results in the unavailability of our system or reduces its capacity could result in real or perceived public safety issues that may affect customer confidence in our services. Historically, we have experienced temporary interruptions of telecommunications or power outages, which were eventually mitigated, although our customer in Puerto Rico was again disrupted by another strong storm (Hurricane Fiona) which hit the island in September 2022. Such instances may result in the slowdown or loss of customer accounts or similar problems if they occur again in the future. Given rapidly changing technologies, we are not certain that we will be able to adapt the use of our services to permit, upgrade, and expand our systems or to integrate smoothly with new technologies. Network and information systems and other technologies are critical to our business activities. Network and information systems-related events, including those caused by us, our service providers or by third parties, such as computer hacking, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing could result in a degradation or disruption of our services. These types of events could result in a loss of customers and large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events.

We currently have one independent director sitting on our Board of Directors. 

Our Board of Directors is currently comprised of two members, one of which would not be considered independent under the rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market and the OTC Markets. Additionally, we no longer maintain separate audit, compensation or nominating and governance committees, the duties of which are fulfilled by our entire Board of Directors. The rules of the OTC Markets require that companies whose securities are listed for quotation on the OTCQB maintain certain public float percentages and a minimum bid price for the Company s shares. In the event that we fail to meet these standards, our Common Stock would no longer be eligible for quotation on the OTCQB, resulting in the quotation of our Common Stock on an alternative market, such as the OTC Pink Open Market. Such change may affect the number and type of investors eligible to purchase our Common Stock. As a result, the price of our Common Stock may be adversely affected. 

Risks Related to Acquisitions 

The success of our business depends on achieving our strategic objectives, including acquisitions, dispositions and restructurings. 

Our acquisitions, as well as potential restructuring actions, may not achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of various factors, including integration and collaboration challenges, such as personnel and technology. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated cost savings from restructuring actions, which could result in lower operating margins. If we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives. After reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business, we are subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms, which may prevent us from completing the transaction. 

We may not be able to grow successfully through our recent acquisitions or through future acquisitions, we may not successfully manage future growth, and we may not be able to effectively integrate businesses that we may acquire. 

We plan to continue to grow organically as well as through strategic acquisitions of other businesses. In order to complete acquisitions, we would expect to require additional debt and/or equity financing, which may increase our interest expense, leverage, and the number of shares of our Common Stock or other securities outstanding. Businesses that we acquire may not perform as expected. Future revenue, profits and cash flows of an acquired business may not materialize due to the failure or inability to capture expected synergies, increased competition, regulatory issues, changes in market conditions, or other factors beyond our control. In addition, we may not be successful in integrating these acquisitions into our existing operations. Competition for acquisition opportunities may escalate, increasing our cost of making further acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making additional acquisitions. Additional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to: 

the potential disruption of our existing business; 

entering new markets or industries in which we have limited prior experience; 

difficulties integrating and retaining key management, sales, research and development, production and other personnel or diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns to integration matters; 

difficulties integrating or expanding information technology systems and other business processes or administrative infrastructures to accommodate the acquired businesses; 

complexities associated with managing the combined businesses due to multiple physical locations; 

risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems; and 

whether any necessary additional debt or equity financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and the impact of such financing on our operating performance and results of operations.

Risks Related to International Operations 

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 

Our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, but operations are conducted internationally. Currency exchange rates have, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our operating results. We utilize limited hedging techniques to minimize our exposure. As a result, an investment in our Common Stock may expose stockholders to fluctuations in exchange rates. 

The dollar cost of our operations internationally could increase as a result of increases or decreases in the rate of inflation or devaluation of the local currency in relation to the dollar, which may harm our results of operations. 

The dollar cost of our international operations is expected to be influenced by any increase in inflation that is not offset by the devaluation of the local currency in relation to the dollar. As a result, we are exposed to the risk that foreign currencies will appreciate in relation to the dollar. We cannot predict whether the foreign currencies will appreciate or depreciate against the dollar in the future. 

International political, economic and military instability may impede our ability to execute our plan of operations. 

Political, economic and military conditions, both domestic and abroad, may affect our business. We cannot predict whether or in what manner these problems may occur. Acts of random terrorism periodically occur, which could affect our operations or personnel. Ongoing or revived hostilities or other factors could harm our operations and could impede our ability to execute our plan of operations. Natural disasters, such as the hurricanes in the Caribbean or Florida, could render our affected customers financially unable to continue making payments or using our services. Moreover, in order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions, it is frequently necessary or required to establish joint ventures, strategic alliances or marketing arrangements with local operators, partners or agents. Reliance on local operators, partners or agents could expose us to the risk of being unable to control the scope or quality of our overseas services or products. In addition, our business insurance may not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with the security situation. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

Risks Related to Our Common Stock 

Certain individuals and groups own or control a significant number of our outstanding shares. 

Certain groups or persons, and in particular ETS Limited, who owned approximately 41 of our issued and outstanding Common Stock as of December 1, 2023, beneficially own a substantial number of shares of our outstanding Common Stock or securities and debt instruments. As a result, these persons have the ability, acting as a group, to influence substantially our affairs and business, including the election of our directors and subject to certain limitations, of fundamental corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or making other transactions more difficult or impossible without their support. In addition, these equity holders may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financing or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such transactions may involve significant risk to us or our other stockholders. Additionally, they may make investments in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us, or may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. 

Sales by certain of our stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. 

A large number of outstanding shares of our Common Stock are held by several of our principal stockholders. If any of these principal stockholders were to decide to sell large amounts of Common Stock over a short period of time, such sales could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline.

A decline in the price of our Common Stock could affect our ability to raise additional working capital and adversely impact our operations and would severely dilute existing or future investors if we were to raise funds at lower prices. 

A prolonged decline in the price of our Common Stock could result in a reduction of our ability to raise capital. Because our operations have been financed in part through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our Common Stock could be especially detrimental to our continued operations. Any reduction in our ability to raise equity capital in the future would force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and would have a significant negative effect on our business plans and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. If our stock price declines, there can be no assurance that we can raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. We believe the following factors could cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate widely: 

actual or anticipated variations in our interim or annual results; 

announcements of new services, products, acquisitions or strategic relationships within the industry; 

changes in accounting treatments or principles; 

changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts and in analyst recommendations; and 

general political, economic, regulatory and market conditions. 

Any failure to meet these expectations, even if minor, could materially adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. 

If we issue additional shares of Common Stock in the future, it will result in the dilution of our existing stockholders. 

Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 30,000,000 shares of Common Stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue additional shares of Common Stock up to the authorized capital stated in the Certificate of Incorporation. The issuance of any such shares of Common Stock will result in a reduction in value of our outstanding Common Stock. If we do issue any such additional shares of Common Stock, such issuance also will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other stockholders. Further, any such issuance may result in a change of control of the Company. 

Our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock and designate rights and preferences that will dilute the ownership and voting interests of existing stockholders without their approval. 

Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.0001 per share Preferred Stock ), of which 1,200,000 shares have been designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Series A Preferred ). Our Board of Directors is authorized to designate, and to determine the rights and preferences of any series or class of Preferred Stock, and may designate additional shares of Preferred Stock in the future. The Board of Directors may, without stockholder approval, issue shares of Preferred Stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which are senior to our Common Stock or which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the existing holders of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock. Additionally, the issuance of Preferred Stock may have the effect of decreasing the market price of the Common Stock and reduce the likelihood that holders of Common Stock will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation. The issuance of shares of Preferred Stock may also adversely affect an acquisition or change in control of the Company. As of December 1, 2023, there were no outstanding shares of Series A Preferred issued and outstanding. 

Trading of our Common Stock may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our Common Stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares. 

There is currently a limited market for our Common Stock and the volume of our Common Stock traded on any day may vary significantly from one day to the other. Our Common Stock is quoted on the OTCQB. Trading in stock quoted on the OTCQB can be volatile, and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with the issuer s operations, results or business prospects. The availability of buyers and sellers represented by this volatility could lead to a market price for our Common Stock that is unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, trading of securities quoted on the OTCQB can be more volatile than the trading of securities listed on a stock exchange like NASDAQ or NYSE.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 

The Company is, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business. Historically, the outcome of nearly all such legal proceedings has not, in the aggregate, had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Other than as set forth below, there are no additional pending or threatened legal proceedings at this time. 

SecureAlert, Inc. v. Federal Government of Mexico (Department of the Interior). On March 24, 2017, SecureAlert Inc. (a predecessor entity to Track Group, Inc. or the Company) filed a complaint before the Federal Administrative Tribunal, asserting the failure by defendants to pay claimant amounts agreed to, and due under, the Pluri Annual Contract for the Rendering of Monitoring Services of Internees, through Electric Bracelets, in the Islas Marias Penitentiary Complex dated July 15, 2011. Although preliminary rulings have been unfavorable to the Company, the Company s counsel continues to review its remaining claims which are upwards of 4.0 million. Based upon the fee arrangement the Company has with its counsel, we anticipate the future liabilities attributable to legal expense will be minimal. 

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, through its Trustees v. International Surveillance Services Corporation. On January 23, 2020, the Company was served with a summons for an Adversary Action pending against International Surveillance Services Corporation ISS ), a subsidiary of the Company, now known as Track Group Puerto Rico Inc., in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico seeking to recover allegedly fraudulent transfers and to disallow claims pursuant to United States Bankruptcy and Puerto Rican law. The allegations stem from payments made to ISS between 2014 and 2017, which the Company believes were properly made in accordance with a contract between ISS and the government of Puerto Rico, through the Oficina de Servicios con Antelacion a Juicio, originally signed in 2011. The Company is confident that all payments it received were earned and due under applicable law and produced documentation supporting its position in an informal document exchange with the Commonwealth on July 6, 2020. At this time, the case remains stayed by Court order. The Company remains confident in its position and no accrual for a potential loss has been made, after consultation with legal counsel. 

Jeffrey Mohamed Abed v. Track Group, Inc., et al. On June 7, 2021, Jeffrey Mohamed Abed filed a complaint seeking unspecified damages in the Superior Court of the State of California, alleging strict products liability, negligence and breach of implied warranty premised upon injuries sustained by Abed who was involved in an automobile accident while wearing a GPS tracking device of the Company. The Company was served on October 15, 2021 and subsequently filed its Answer and Affirmative Defenses and issued discovery. On July 17, 2023, the action was consolidated with a related case brought by Plaintiff against other motorists involved in the automobile accident. The Company disputes Abed s claims and will defend the case vigorously. The Company remains confident in its position and no accrual for a potential loss has been made, after consultation with legal counsel. 

Track Group Chile SpA. v. Republic of Chile. On January 24, 2022, Track Group Chile SpA. initiated a judicial action in the Court of Justice of Chile to settle a contract dispute with the Republic of Chile. The Company asserts that it has complied with its contractual obligations and that any delays in so doing were not attributable to the Company. The Company remains confident in its position and no accrual for a potential loss has been made, after consultation with legal counsel. 

Jesus Valle Gonzalez, et al. v. Track Group-Puerto Rico, et al. On May 9, 2022, Plaintiff Jesus Valle Gonzalez filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance, San Juan Superior Court, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico against the Company, and associated parties alleging the death of his mother on June 8, 2016 was a result of the gross negligence of all the defendants. This claim follows a similar claim made against the Company in June 2017 by different relatives of the deceased which was settled on September 5, 2018. Plaintiff in this matter asserts his claim now having reached the age of majority and is requesting damages of 1.5 million. On August 22, 2023, the Superior Court dismissed the Plaintiffs case for lack of jurisdiction.

Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans 

The 2022 Stock Incentive Plan 

At the annual meeting of stockholders on April 13, 2022, our stockholders approved the 2022 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the 2022 Plan ), previously approved by the Company s Board. The 2022 Plan provides for the grant of incentive options and nonqualified options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance stock units, dividend equivalents, stock payments, deferred stock, restricted stock units, other stock-based awards and performance-based awards to employees and certain non-employees who provide services to the Company in lieu of cash. A total of 500,000 shares are authorized for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the 2022 Plan. The 2022 Plan supersedes and replaces the Company s 2012 Equity Compensation Plan (the 2012 Plan ). 

The 2012 Stock Incentive Plan 

The 2022 Plan supersedes and replaces the 2012 Plan. As of June 30, 2020 , the Board suspended further awards under the 2012 Plan. Any awards outstanding under the 2012 Plan will remain subject to the 2012 Plan. All shares of Common Stock remaining authorized and available for issuance under the 2012 Plan and any shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2012 Plan that subsequently expire, terminate, or are surrendered or forfeited for any reason without issuance of shares will automatically become available for issuance under our 2022 Plan. 

There were no issuances of restricted shares in Fiscal 2023. 

On April 13, 2022, the Company issued 285,000 restricted shares of Common Stock to members of its executive team pursuant to the 2022 Plan valued at 370,500. The Company recorded expense of 207,547 for the year ended September 30, 2022 in connection with the grant. 

As of September 30, 2023, there were 215,000 shares of Common Stock remaining available for issuance under the 2022 Plan as well as 27,218 available under the 2012 plan.

Results of Operations 

Continuing Operations - Fiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022 

Revenue 

During Fiscal 2023, we had revenue of 34,475,865 compared to revenue of 36,968,499 for Fiscal 2022, a decrease of 2,492,634, or approximately 7 . Of this revenue, 33,503,687 and 35,768,090 were from monitoring and other related services revenue during Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, respectively, representing a decrease of 2,264,403 or approximately 6 . The decrease in revenue from clients in Illinois, California, Canada, Mississippi was due to a reduction in people assigned to monitoring in those locations. This decline was partially offset by revenue increases for clients in Louisiana, Philadelphia, Nevada and Chile who experienced increases in the number of people assigned to monitoring. These increases and reductions from all of these locations represent typical fluctuations which occur daily. The Company s partner in the Bahamas contributed a small amount of revenue in Fiscal 2022 which went away in Fiscal 2023 as the government elected to work with a different local partner. 

Product and other revenue for Fiscal 2023 decreased to 972,178 from 1,200,409 in the same period in 2022, a decrease of 228,231 or approximately 19 . The decrease in product and other revenue was largely due to lower international product sales, principally in Saudi Arabia and lower IntelliTrack installation and training. We continue to largely focus on recurring subscription-based opportunities as opposed to equipment sales. 

The industry in which the Company operates, as well as many other industries (automotive, consumer products and medical devices), have been impacted by the global semiconductor shortage. The availability of semiconductor parts has continued to improve in Fiscal 2023; however, long lead times remain with certain parts. 

Cost of Revenue 

During Fiscal 2023, cost of revenue totaled 19,178,790 compared to cost of revenue during Fiscal 2022 of 19,615,543, a decrease of 436,753, or approximately 2 . The decrease in cost of revenue was largely the result of lower communication costs of 493,436, lower monitoring center costs of 356,156, lower commission costs of 120,093 and lower product sales costs of 96,558. These decreases were offset by higher device maintenance costs related to regreasing some outstanding devices of 622,987. 

Depreciation and amortization included in cost of revenue for Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022, totaled 3,263,490 and 3,237,970, respectively, an increase of 25,520, or approximately 1 . These costs represent the depreciation of ReliAlert and other monitoring devices, as well as the amortization of monitoring software and certain royalty agreements. The increase in depreciation and amortization costs is largely due to an increase in device depreciation expense of 158,676, offset by a decrease in amortization of 133,156 for the discontinued products, Shadow and InTouch. Amortization of a patent related to GPS and satellite tracking are also included in depreciation and amortization. Devices are depreciated over either a three- or five-year useful life. Monitoring software is amortized over a seven-year life. Royalty agreements are being amortized over a ten-year useful life. The Company believes these lives are appropriate due to changes in electronic monitoring technology and the corresponding potential for obsolescence. Management periodically assesses the useful life of the devices for appropriateness. 

Gross Profit and Margin 

During Fiscal 2023, gross profit totaled 15,297,075, resulting in a 44 gross margin, compared to 17,352,956, or a 47 gross margin, during Fiscal 2022. The decrease in absolute gross profit of 2,055,881 is due to a decrease in revenue of 2,492,634, higher device repair costs and nominally higher depreciation and amortization costs, partially offset by lower monitoring center costs, lower communication costs, lower commission costs and lower product sales costs. 

General and Administrative Expense 

During Fiscal 2023, our general and administrative expense totaled 10,275,695, compared to 12,462,931 for Fiscal 2022. The decrease of 2,187,236, or approximately 18 , in general and administrative cost resulted largely from the impairment of intangible assets of 1,728,961 associated with the discontinuance of two product lines in Fiscal 2022, lower Board of Director fees of 153,257, and lower legal and professional fees of 909,499, partially offset by higher outside service costs of 124,218, higher payroll expense of 257,037 and higher bad debt of 183,550. 

Selling and Marketing Expense 

For Fiscal 2023, our selling and marketing expense was 2,842,661 compared to 2,993,749 for Fiscal 2022. The decrease of 151,088 or approximately 5 resulted largely from lower wages and related payroll taxes of 115,972 and lower outside services of 79,415, partially offset by higher travel and entertainment costs of 77,895.

Table of Contents 

Research and Development Expense 

During Fiscal 2023, we incurred research and development expense of 2,735,060 compared to those costs recognized during Fiscal 2022 totaling 2,432,448, an increase of 302,612 or approximately 12 . The increase was largely due to increased payroll and related tax expense of 298,846. The capitalization of developed technology, in accordance with the accounting guidance for internal-use software, was 865,263 during Fiscal 2022 and increased to 1,020,604 or 40 in Fiscal 2023 due to technology projects currently in development. 

Depreciation and Amortization Expense 

We maintain a significant portion of our tangible and intangible assets that are amortized or depreciated. During Fiscal 2023, depreciation and amortization included in operating expense totaled 987,472 compared to 1,563,729 for Fiscal 2022. This decrease of 576,257, or approximately 37 , was largely due to intangible assets that were fully amortized or fully impaired in Fiscal 2022. 

Other Income (Expense) 

During Fiscal 2023, total other expense was 1,219,845 compared to 4,406,973 during Fiscal 2022, a decrease of 3,187,128 or approximately 72 . The decrease in Fiscal 2023 was primarily due to positive currency exchange rate movements and a legal settlement of 1,600,000 in third quarter 2022 offset principally by the forgiveness of an accrued expense by a significant vendor of 633,471 in Fiscal 2022. 

Income taxes 

During Fiscal 2023, income tax expense totaled 627,850 compared to 883,488 during Fiscal 2022. Tax expense in both fiscal years are income taxes largely related to a foreign jurisdiction. 

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders 

We had a net loss attributable to common stockholders for Fiscal 2023 totaling 3,391,508), or 0.30) and 0.30) per basic and diluted common share, respectively, compared to net loss of 7,390,362), or 0.64) and 0.64) per basic and diluted common share, respectively, for Fiscal 2022. This decrease in net loss is largely due to lower general and administrative expense, lower selling and marketing expense, lower depreciation and amortization, lower other expense and lower tax expense, partially offset by lower gross profit and higher research and development expense. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The company believes that its existing cash and its future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing business for the foreseeable future.

No additional funds were borrowed during the years ended September 30, 2023 or 2022. 

Inflation 

The rise in inflation in Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2023 has adversely impacted the Company s cost of labor, materials and other operating expense, but we anticipate continued operational changes to mitigate some or all of the inflationary pressures. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financial Arrangements 

The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company, except as described below. 

Bond guarantees 

As of September 30, 2023, the Company has one performance bond in connection with a foreign customer totaling 1,654,134 Performance Bonds of which 1,157,867 is held in an interest-bearing account on behalf of the bank and is recorded in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount held on this Performance Bond will be released after the expiration of the Performance Bond, all contract extensions have been exhausted, and the consent of the customer, but in no event before July 2024 and more likely in 2025. 

The amounts held on two performance bonds were released in the second quarter of 2023 and the Company received 1,041,797, including interest.

Critical Accounting Policies 

In Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report, we discuss those accounting policies we consider to be significant in determining the results of operations and our financial position. 

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, warranty obligations, product liability, revenue, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and other facts and circumstances that are believed to be reasonable, and the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. The actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

With respect to revenue recognition, impairment of long-lived assets, leases, stock-based compensation and allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, we apply critical accounting policies discussed below in the preparation of our financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition 

Our revenue is predominantly derived from two sources: (i) monitoring services, and (ii) product sales. 

Monitoring and Other Related Services 

Monitoring services include two components: (i) lease contracts pursuant to which the Company provides monitoring services and leased devices to distributors or end users and the Company retains ownership of the leased device; and (ii) monitoring services purchased by distributors or end users who have previously purchased monitoring devices and opt to use the Company s monitoring services. Monitoring revenue is recognized ratably over time, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of these services as they are performed. Payment due or received from the customers prior to rendering the associated services are recorded as deferred revenue. 

Product Sales and Other 

The Company sells devices and replacement parts to customers under certain contracts, as well as law enforcement software licenses and maintenance, and analytical software. Revenue from the sale of devices and parts is recognized upon their transfer of control to the customer, which is generally upon shipment, but may vary per contract. Payment terms are generally 30 days from invoice date. When purchasing products (such as ReliAlert devices) from the Company, customers may, but are not required to, enter into monitoring service contracts with us. The Company recognizes revenue on monitoring services for customers that have previously purchased devices at the end of each month that monitoring services have been provided. 

Multiple Element Arrangements 

The majority of our revenue transactions do not have multiple elements. However, on occasion, the Company may enter into revenue transactions that have multiple elements. These may include different combinations of products or services that are included in a single billable rate. These products or services are delivered over time as the customer utilizes our services. In cases where obligations in a contract are distinct and thus require separation into multiple performance obligations, revenue recognition guidance requires that contract consideration be allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The value allocated to each performance obligation is then recognized as revenue when the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct promise or bundle of promises has been met. There were no multiple element arrangements for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. 

Other Matters 

The Company considers an arrangement with payment terms longer than the Company s normal terms not to be fixed or determinable. Normal payment terms for the sale of monitoring services and products are due upon receipt to 30 days. The Company sells devices and services directly to end users and to distributors. Distributors do not have general rights of return. Also, distributors may not have price protection or stock protection rights with respect to devices sold to them by us. Generally, title and risk of loss pass to the buyer upon delivery of the devices. 

Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are included as part of total revenue. The related freight costs and supplies directly associated with shipping products to customers are included as a component of cost of revenue. Our revenue is predominantly derived from two sources: (i) monitoring services, and (ii) product sales. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill 

We review our long-lived assets including goodwill and intangibles for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of an asset may not be recoverable, and in the case of goodwill, at least annually. We evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate possible impairment as of each balance sheet date. We use an equity method of the related asset or group of assets in measuring whether the assets are recoverable. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its market value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. Impairment of long-lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are an identifiable fair market value that is independent of other groups of assets. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos 

We must make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable. In doing so, we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer credit-worthiness, current macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. 

The Company also maintains an allowance for estimated credit memos to be issued against current sales. Estimates of allowance for credit memos are based upon the application of a historical issuance lag period to the average credit memos issued each month. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB or other standard setting bodies, which are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption. 

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 

We recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on their grant date fair value. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires us to make estimates for certain assumptions regarding risk-free interest rate, expected life of options, expected volatility of stock, and expected dividend yield of stock. 

Government Regulation 

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. We are not involved in any pending or, to our knowledge, threatened governmental proceedings, which would require curtailment of our operations because of such laws and regulations. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Our business extends to countries outside the United States, and we intend to continue to expand our foreign operations. As a result, our revenue and results of operations are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates, and other uncertainties inherent in doing business in more than one currency. In addition, our operations are exposed to risks that are associated with changes in social, political, and economic conditions in the foreign countries in which we operate, including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment and the repatriation of cash to the parent company, as well as, to a lesser extent, changes in United States laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment. 

Foreign Currency Risks 

We had 6,383,735 and 6,095,403 in foreign currency revenue for Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022, respectively. We made and received payments in a foreign currency during the periods indicated, which resulted in a foreign exchange gain of 467,868 and foreign exchange expense of 1,619,018 in Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Fluctuations in the exchange loss or gain in any given period are due to the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Chilean Peso and Canadian dollar which have been magnified by global matters, inflation, and the government policies established to address those issues. Changes in currency exchange rates affect the relative prices at which we sell our products and purchase goods and services. Given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot estimate the effect of these fluctuations on our future business, product pricing, results of operations, or financial condition. We periodically enter into small, simple forward foreign currency exchange contracts or derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk of repatriating funds converted from foreign currency into U.S. dollars. To the extent foreign sales become a more significant part of our business in the future, we may seek to implement additional strategies which make use of these or other instruments to minimize the effects of foreign currency exchange on our business and/or require some international customers to receive invoices and make payments in US dollars. The Company had no active foreign currency exchange contracts as of September 30, 2023.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We have established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to the Company is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2023 was completed pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms as of September 30, 2023. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate as a result of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO issued in May 2013 and related COSO guidance. Based on our evaluation under this framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023. 

This report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this Annual Report. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

This Code contains general guidelines for conducting our business consistent with the highest standards of business ethics and is intended to qualify as a code of ethics within the meaning of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated thereunder. A copy of our Code is available online at www.trackgrp.com . Any amendments to or waivers from a provision of our Code that apply to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller or persons performing similar functions and that relates to any element of the Code will be made available to the public at the aforementioned website. 

Board Leadership Structure 

In addition to the CEO s leadership, the Board maintains effective independent oversight through a number of governance practices, including, open and direct communication with management, input on meeting agendas, and regular executive sessions. 

Board Role in Risk Assessment 

Management, in consultation with outside professionals, as applicable, identifies risks associated with the Company s operations, strategies and financial statements. Risk assessment is also performed through periodic reports received by the Board from management, counsel and the Company s independent registered public accountants relating to risk assessment and management. Our Board meets privately in executive sessions with representatives of the Company s independent registered public accountants. The Board also provides risk oversight through its periodic reviews of the financial and operational performance of the Company. 

Director Nominations 

The Board nominates directors for election at the annual meetings of stockholders held and appoints new directors to fill vacancies when they arise, and has the responsibility to identify, evaluate and recruit qualified candidates to the Board for such nomination or appointment.

Table of Contents 

The Board identifies director nominees by first considering those current members of the Board who are willing to continue service. Current members of the Board with skills and experience that are relevant to our business and who are willing to continue service are considered for re-nomination, balancing the value of continuity of service by existing members of the Board with that of obtaining a new perspective. Nominees for director are selected by a majority of the members of the Board. Although the Company does not have a formal diversity policy, in considering the suitability of director nominees, the Board considers such factors as it deems appropriate to develop a Board that is diverse in nature and comprised of experienced and seasoned advisors. Factors considered by the Board include judgment, knowledge, skill, diversity, integrity, experience with businesses and other organizations of comparable size, including experience in the software and/or technology industries, software, intellectual property, business, finance, administration or public service, the relevance of a candidate s experience to our needs and experience of other Board members, experience with accounting rules and practices, the desire to balance the considerable benefit of continuity with the periodic injection of the fresh perspective provided by new members, and the extent to which a candidate would be a desirable addition to the Board and any committees of the Board. 

A stockholder who wishes to suggest a prospective nominee for the Board may notify the Secretary of the Company in writing with any supporting material the stockholder considers appropriate. Nominees suggested by stockholders are considered in the same way as nominees suggested from other sources. 

In addition, the Company s Bylaws contain provisions that address the process by which a stockholder may nominate an individual to stand for election to the Board at the Company s annual meeting of stockholders. In order to nominate a candidate for director, a stockholder must give timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Company and otherwise comply with the provisions of the Company s Bylaws. Information required by the Company s Bylaws to be in the notice include: the name, contact information and share ownership information for the candidate and the person making the nomination, and other information about the nominee that must be disclosed in proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the Exchange Act and its related rules and regulations. The Board may also require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Board to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as director of the Company. The recommendation should be sent to: Secretary, Track Group, Inc., 200 E. 5th Avenue, Suite 100, Naperville, Illinois 60563. You can obtain a copy of the Company s Bylaws by writing to the Secretary at this address. 

Stockholder Communications 

If you wish to communicate with the Board, you may send your communication in writing to: Secretary, Track Group, Inc., 200 E. 5th Avenue, Suite 100, Naperville, Illinois 60563. You must include your name and address in the written communication and indicate whether you are a stockholder of the Company. The Secretary will review any communication received from a stockholder, and all material and appropriate communications from stockholders will be forwarded to the appropriate director or directors or committee of the Board based on the subject matter. 

Board Meetings 

Directors are generally elected for a term of one year or more until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors have been elected or appointed and duly qualified. Vacancies on the Board which are created by the retirement, resignation or removal of a director, may be filled by the vote of the remaining members of the Board, with such new director serving the remainder of the term or until his/her successor is elected and qualified. 

The Board is elected by and is accountable to our stockholders. The Board establishes policy and provides strategic direction, oversight, and control. The Board met 9 times during the year ended September 30, 2023 and incumbent directors attended 100 of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board exclusive of meetings where a Director was excused from attendance based upon the subject matter of discussion. 

Board Committees and Charters 

Prior to May 31, 2018, the Board had three standing committees which consisted of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Due to the resignations of certain former directors during 2018 as previously disclosed by the Company and the current size of the Board, these committees are no longer active. Instead, the full Board administers the duties of each of these committees and will likely do so for the foreseeable future.

Table of Contents 

Audit Committee 

Prior to May 31, 2018, we had a separately designated standing Audit Committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act. The primary duties of the Audit Committee were to oversee (i) management s conduct related to our financial reporting process, including reviewing the financial reports and other financial information provided by the Company, and reviewing our systems of internal accounting and financial controls, (ii) our independent auditors qualifications and independence and the audit and non-audit services provided to the Company, and (iii) the engagement and performance of our independent auditors. The Audit Committee assisted the Board in providing oversight of our financial and related activities, including capital market transactions. The Audit Committee has a charter, a copy of which is available on our website at www.trackgrp.com . 

Currently, the entire Board serves in the capacity as an Audit Committee with Ms. Macleod also serving as Committee Chair. With the exception of Mr. Sehnaoui, each member of the Audit Committee, satisfy, as determined by the full Board, the definition of independent director as established in the OTC Rules and all members are financially literate. In accordance with Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Board designated Ms. Macleod as the Audit Committee s audit committee financial expert as defined by the applicable regulations promulgated by the SEC. The Audit Committee met with our Chief Financial Officer and with our independent registered public accounting firm and evaluated the responses by the Chief Financial Officer, both to the facts presented and to the judgments made by our independent registered public accounting firm. 

Our full Board reviewed and discussed the matters required by United States auditing standards required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB and our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 Fiscal 2023 with management and our independent registered public accounting firm. Our Board received the written disclosures and the letter from our independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable PCAOB standards, and our Board discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. 

Compensation Committee 

We currently do not have a compensation committee of the Board or a committee performing similar functions. It is the view of the Board that it is appropriate for us not to have such a committee because of our size and because the Board participates in the consideration of executive compensation. As such, the entire Board has the responsibility for developing and maintaining an executive compensation policy that creates a direct relationship between pay levels and corporate performance and returns to stockholders. The Board monitors the results of such policy to assure that the compensation payable to our executive officers provides overall competitive pay levels, creates proper incentives to enhance stockholder value, rewards superior performance, and is justified by the returns available to stockholders. The Board also has periodically retained outside benefit consultants to assess compensation policies and adjust as recommended. 

Additionally, the Board administers compensation plans in a manner consistent with the terms of such plans (including, as applicable, the granting of stock options, restricted stock, stock units and other awards, the review of performance goals established before the start of the relevant plan year, and the determination of performance compared to the goals at the end of the plan year). None of our executive officers served as a director or member of the compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our Board. 

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 

We do not have a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Our Board selects individuals to stand for election as members of the Board and does not have a policy with regards to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by our stockholders. Our Board has determined that it is in the best position to evaluate our company s requirements as well as the qualifications of each candidate when it considers a nominee for a position on the Board. As such, the entire Board has the responsibility for identifying and recommending candidates to fill vacant and newly created Board positions, setting corporate governance guidelines regarding director qualifications and responsibilities, and planning for senior management succession. 

Currently, our full Board is required to review the qualifications and backgrounds of all directors and nominees (without regard to whether a nominee has been recommended by stockholders), as well as the overall composition of the Board, and recommend director candidates to be nominated for election at the annual meeting of stockholders, or, in the case of a vacancy on the Board, elect a new director to fill such vacancy. If stockholders wish to recommend candidates directly to our Board, they may do so by communicating directly with our Secretary at the address specified on the cover of this annual report. There has not been any change to the procedures that our stockholders may recommend nominees to our Board.

Independent Directors 

The Board has determined that Ms. Macleod is an independent director of the Company as defined by the rules and regulations of the OTC Markets. Ms. Macleod meets the independence standards established by the OTC Markets and the SEC. In addition, the Board has determined that of its current directors, Ms. Macleod satisfies the definition of an audit committee financial expert under SEC rules and regulations. These designations do not impose any duties, obligations or liabilities that are greater than those generally imposed as members of the Board, and the designation as an audit committee financial expert does not affect the duties, obligations or liability of any other member of the Board. 

Indemnification of Officers and Directors 

As permitted by Delaware law, the Company will indemnify its directors and officers against expenses and liabilities they incur to defend, settle, or satisfy any civil or criminal action brought against them on account of their being or having been Company directors or officers unless, in any such action, they are adjudged to have acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

 To the Board of Directors 

 Track Group, Inc. 

 Naperville, IL 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Track Group, Inc. as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity/(deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Track Group, Inc. as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the entity s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to Track Group, Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Track Group, Inc. is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risk of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Recoverability of Goodwill 

As discussed in Notes 2 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s balance of goodwill was 7,851,466. The determination of the recoverability of goodwill requires management to make significant assumptions and complex judgments related to fair value of the goodwill. On an annual basis and at interim periods when circumstances require, management tests the recoverability of the Company s goodwill. 

We identified the recoverability of goodwill as a critical audit matter. Auditing these complex judgments and assumptions involves especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill or knowledge needed. 

F-2

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 

Evaluating management s analysis relating to their identification of reporting units, which is the unit of accounting for which goodwill is assigned and tested for impairment. 

Gaining an understanding of management s processes, controls and methodology for determining and developing the fair value estimate, including evaluating the appropriateness of the income approach and market approach used to develop the fair value estimate. 

Testing the completeness, accuracy and relevance of the underlying data used in these fair value approaches. 

Evaluating the significant assumptions used by management in the Company s income approach, including the amount and timing of cash flows throughout the forecasted period, the scheduled depreciation expense and capital expenditures necessary to sustain the business. 

Evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable by considering (i) the past performance of the Company, (ii) the consistency of these assumptions with third-party industry and economic date, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. 

Utilizing a valuation specialist to assist in testing the Company s fair value determination. 

/s/ 

We have served as Track Group, Inc. s auditor since 2013. Hansen, Barnett and Maxwell, P.C., who joined Eide Bailly LLP in 2013, had served as the Company s auditor since 2005.

The Company s ability to return to profitable operations is dependent upon generating a level of revenue adequate to support its cost structure, which it was close to achieving on an operating basis in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, excluding the approximate million asset impairment and was close to achieving in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.

Product Sales and Other 

The Company sells devices and replacement parts to customers under certain contracts, as well as law enforcement software licenses and maintenance, and analytical software. Revenue transactions associated with the sale of devices and replacement parts comprise a single performance obligation. We satisfy the performance obligation when the Company has transferred control of the product to the customer and they receive substantially all of the benefits. Transfer of control passes to customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price and payment terms for the transaction depends on the agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 60 days or less of shipment. The Company recognizes revenue from other services as the customer receives services and the Company has the right to payment. When purchasing products (such as ReliAlert devices) from the Company, customers may, but are not required to, enter into monitoring service contracts with us. The Company recognizes revenue on monitoring services for customers that have previously purchased devices at the end of each month that monitoring services have been provided. 

Multiple Element Arrangements 

The majority of our revenue transactions do not have multiple elements. However, on occasion, the Company may enter into revenue transactions that have multiple elements. These may include different combinations of products or services that are included in a single billable rate. These products or services are delivered over time as the customer utilizes our services. In cases where obligations in a contract are distinct and thus require separation into multiple performance obligations, revenue recognition guidance requires that contract consideration be allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The value allocated to each performance obligation is then recognized as revenue when the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct promise or bundle of promises has been met. There were no multiple element arrangements for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. 

Other Matters 

The Company considers an arrangement with payment terms longer than the Company s normal terms not to be fixed or determinable. Normal payment terms for the sale of monitoring services and products are due upon receipt to 30 days. The Company sells devices and services directly to end users and to distributors. Distributors do not have general rights of return. Also, distributors have no price protection or stock protection rights with respect to devices sold to them by us. Generally, title and risk of loss pass to the buyer upon delivery of the devices. 

Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are included as part of total revenue. The related freight costs and supplies directly associated with shipping products to customers are included as a component of cost of revenue.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 adds a current expected credit loss CECL impairment model to GAAP that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Modified retrospective adoption is required with any cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. ASU 2016-13 became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, excluding smaller reporting entities, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in fiscal year 2024.

Product Sales and Other . The Company sells devices and replacement parts to customers under certain contracts, as well as law enforcement software licenses and maintenance, and analytical software. Revenue from the sale of devices and parts is recognized upon their transfer of control to the customer, which is generally upon delivery. Delivery is considered complete at either the time of shipment or arrival at destination, based on the agreed upon terms within the contract. Payment terms are generally 30 days from the invoice date. 

Multiple Element Arrangements . The majority of our revenue transactions do not have multiple elements. However, on occasion, the Company may enter revenue transactions that have multiple elements. These may include different combinations of products or services that are included in a single billable rate. These products or services are delivered over time as the customer utilizes our services. In cases where obligations in a contract are distinct and thus require separation into multiple performance obligations, revenue recognition guidance requires that contract consideration be allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The value allocated to each performance obligation is then recognized as revenue when the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct promise or bundle of promises has been met. There were no multiple element arrangements for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. 

The standalone selling price for each performance obligation is an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the good or service. When there is only one performance obligation associated with a contract, the entire sale value is attributed to that obligation. When a contract contains multiple performance obligations the transaction value is first allocated using the observable price, which is generally a list price, net of applicable discount, or the price used to sell in similar circumstances. In circumstances when a selling price is not directly observable, the Company will estimate the standalone selling price using information available to us.

, of which expires during the year ended September 30, 2023. The utilization of the net loss carryforwards is dependent upon the tax laws in effect at the time the net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized. The Internal Revenue Code contains provisions that likely could reduce or limit the availability and utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards. An ownership change generally affects the rate at which NOLs and potentially other deferred tax assets are permitted to offset future taxable income. Since the Company maintains a full valuation allowance on all U.S. and state deferred tax assets, the impact of prior year ownership changes on the future realizability of U.S. and state deferred tax assets did not result in an impact to the provision for income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2023, or on net deferred tax asset as of September 30, 2022. In the past, ownership changes of the Company resulted in a Sec. 382 limitation on the future realizability of U.S. state NOLs. Since the Company maintains a full valuation allowance on all U.S. and state deferred tax assets, the impact of the Sec. 382 limitation did not result in an impact to the provision for income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2023, or on net deferred assets as of September 30, 2023.

Leases 

Leases as Lessor 

Monitoring Equipment and Other Related Services 

The Company leases monitoring equipment and provides monitoring services to its customers with contract terms varying from month-to-month to several years and each daily contract price varies. Devices supplied to customers are not serial number unique and a single device may be used by multiple customers over its useful life. If a leased device is returned for repair, it will likely be replaced with a different device from a different customer or possibly a new device. 

The Company s tracking devices are considered operating leases under ASC 842 as transfer of control of the asset does not occur at the end of the lease, a single device is not specific to a customer and devices may be used by multiple customers throughout their life cycle. Due to the movement of devices from customer to customer, relatively few long-term contracts, the measurement of the equipment life and the present value of the equipment s fair values would not be a measurement to qualify the devices as sales-type leases. 

Operating lease and monitoring revenue associated with the Company s monitoring equipment as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are shown in the table below: 

The Company cannot accurately estimate 5-years of future minimum lease receipts for its devices leased to customers because none of its customers make any contractual commitment regarding the number of active devices utilized in any given year and those quantities of active devices vary significantly for every customer each and every day.
