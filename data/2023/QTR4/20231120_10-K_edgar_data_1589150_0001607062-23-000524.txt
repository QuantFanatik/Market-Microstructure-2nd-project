 CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

 This
annual report on Form 10-K and other reports that we file with the SEC contain statements that are considered forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements give the Company s current expectations, plans, objectives, assumptions or forecasts of future events. All statements
other than statements of current or historical fact contained in this annual report, including statements regarding the Company s
future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations,
are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as anticipate, 
 estimate, plans, potential, projects, ongoing, expects, 
 management believes, we believe, we intend, and similar expressions. These statements are based
on the Company s current plans and are subject to risks and uncertainties, and as such the Company s actual future activities
and results of operations may be materially different from those set forth in the forward looking statements. Any or all of the forward-looking
statements in this annual report may turn out to be inaccurate and as such, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements. The Company has based these forward-looking statements largely on its current expectations and projections about future
events and financial trends that it believes may affect its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial
needs. The forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions
due to a number of factors, including: 

dependence
 on key personnel; 

competitive
 factors; 

degree
 of success of research and development programs 

the
 operation of our business; and 

general
 economic conditions 

These
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and except to the extent required by federal securities
laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which
the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on
our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained
in any forward-looking statements. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or persons
acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this annual report.

PART
I 

 Item
1. Business 

 We
were incorporated April 24, 2012 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We intend to engage primarily in the development of regenerative
medical applications which we intend to license, develop internally or acquire outright from other entities up to the point of successful
completion of Phase I and or Phase II clinical trials after which we would either attempt to sell or license those developed applications
or, alternatively, advance the application further to Phase III clinical trials. The primary factor to be considered by us in arriving
at a decision to advance an application further to Phase III clinical trials would be a greater than anticipated indication of efficacy
seen in Phase I trials. 

 As of September
15, 2023 we have not licensed any existing therapies which may be marketed.

Principal
Products and Services 

 The
Company has begun development of HemaXellerate, a cellular therapy designed to heal damaged bone marrow. HemaXellerate is a patient-specific
composition of cells that have been demonstrated to repair damaged bone marrow and stimulate production of blood cells based in previous
animal studies. The initial application of HemaXellerate will be the treatment of severe aplastic anemia which is characterized by immune-mediated
bone marrow hypoplasia (underdevelopment or incomplete development of a tissue) and pancytopenia (reduction in the number of blood cells
and platelets). 

 Adipose
tissue is collected from the patient and processed in order to separate, extract and isolate Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF), a mix of
various cell types including mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells. Mesenchymal stem cells are connective tissue cells that can
differentiate into a variety of cell types and endothelial cells are the cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels and lymphatic
vessels and which play a vital role in angiogenesis (the physiological process through which new blood vessels form from pre-existing
vessels). 

 The
isolated SVF is then intravenously administered to the patient. The Company believes that the isolated SVF will generate growth factors
with the ability to repair damaged hematopoietic stem cells. Hematopoietic stem cells are immature cells that can develop into all types
of blood cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Hematopoietic stem cells are found in the peripheral blood
and the bone marrow. 

 On
February 5, 2013 Regen filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA to initiate a Phase I clinical trial assessing HemaXellerate in patients with drug-refractory aplastic anemia. The Phase I clinical trial
is intended to determine safety and potential efficacy of intravenously administered autologous SVF cells in patients with severe, immune
suppressive refractory aplastic anemia with the primary endpoints of safety and feasibility and secondary endpoints of efficacy as determined
by patients having complete response, partial response or relapse. 

 Under
the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a previously unapproved drug or biologic intended to
treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the
United States. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication
for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven year period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from
approving another marketing application for the same drug for that time period. The sponsor of the product would also be entitled to
a United States federal tax credit equal to 50 of clinical investigation expenses as well as exemptions from certain fees. 

The Company believes that this application of HemaXellerate qualifies for Orphan designation under the Orphan Drug Act due to the fact
that aplastic anemia is a rare disease with prevalence in the United States of less than 200,000 and intends to apply to the FDA for
Orphan designation for HemaXellerate. 

 On
December 10, 2015 Regen was informed by the United States Food and Drug Administration that Regen has satisfactorily addressed all clinical
hold issues related to Regen s Investigational New Drug Application for HemaXellerate and may initiate a Phase I clinical trial
assessing HemaXellerate in patients with drug-refractory aplastic anemia. The Phase I clinical trial is intended to determine safety
and potential efficacy of intravenously administered autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells in patients with severe, immune
suppressive refractory aplastic anemia with the primary endpoints of safety and feasibility and secondary endpoints of efficacy as determined
by patients having complete response, partial response or relapse. 

 dCellVax
is intended to be a therapy whereby dendritic cells of the cancer patient are harvested from the body, treated with siRNA that has the
ability to block the dendritic cell from expressing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase IDO and subsequently reimplanted in the
cancer patient. 

8 

The
dendritic cells that are treated with the IDO-blocking RNA become resistant to the influence of tumor cells which produce factors which
cause the dendritic cell to express the IDO. Expression of IDO in the dendritic cell halts the dendritic cell from activating T cells
and causes the dendritic cell to suppress T cells. T lymphocytes T cells are a lymphocyte that play a central role in
the human immune system s attempt to eradicate tumors. The Company has filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with
the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial assessing safety with signals
of efficacy of the dCellVax gene-silenced dendritic cell immunotherapy for treating breast cancer. The proposed trial will recruit 10
patients with metastatic breast cancer and will involve 4 monthly injections of the dCellVax gene-silenced dendritic cell therapy. The
trial is anticipated to last one year, with tumor assessment before therapy and at 6 and 12 months. 

 On
May 12, 2021 the Company executed a consulting agreement with Biotech Research Group Corporation, an FDA Specialist Group and
Global Regulatory and Scientific Experts, for the purpose of review and guidance with regard to the planned reinstatement of the Company s
inactive Investigational New Drug applications (INDs) #15376 (HemaXellerate) and #16200 (dCellVax) filed with the United States Food
and Drug Administration FDA ). The securing of the services to be provided to the Company pursuant to this consulting agreement
marks the first step taken by the Company with regard to activating the Company s currently inactive applications to initiate clinical
trials. 

 tCellVax
is intended to be a therapy where immune cells are removed from the cancer patient, treated with siRNA which inhibits NR2F6 and the cells
re-infused to the patient. NR2F6 normally acts as a brake on the ability of various immune cells from being activated. The immune cells
that are treated with the NR2F6-blocking siRNA become highly activated and can efficiently kill tumors.. The Company has filed an Investigational
New Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA to initiate a Phase I clinical trial
assessing safety and feasibility of the dCellVax gene-silenced immune cell immunotherapy for treating patients with solid tumors that
are metastatic or not able to be removed surgically. The proposed trial will recruit 25 patients with metastatic cancer and will involve
3 monthly injections of the dCellVax gene-silenced dendritic cell therapy. The trial is anticipated to last one year, with tumor assessment
before therapy and at 6 and 12 months. 

 DiffronC:
NR2F6 is a transcription factor that is present in many cells in the body, including immune cells but also highly expressed in certain
solid tumors. NR2F6 normally acts as a brake on the ability of various immune cells from being activated and also allows tumor cells
to keep growing. The Company has developed a proprietary drug that is based on shRNA technology, which prevents NR2F6 from being expressed.
By inhibiting the expression of NR2F6, immune cells that are treated with the NR2F6-blocking shRNA become highly activated and can efficiently
kill tumors and tumors that have NR2F6 suppressed begin to differentiate.. We are currently in pre-clinical testing of this drug to optimize
its delivery in vivo. 

 DuraCar:
DuraCar is a new cellular therapy being developed by the Company. It is comprised of CAR-T cells which contain an shRNA targeting the
gene NR2F6. CAR-T cells are T cells (the lymphoid cells of the body that kill tumors) isolated from a cancer patient that have been modified
by expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) which is specific for the patient s tumor. These CAR-T cells are then re-infused
back into the patient. The CAR-T cells then home in directly on the tumor because they have been given the tumor-specific address via
the CAR. While CAR-T cells are very effective in treating leukemias, they are not effective at treating most solid tumors. The reason
for this is believed to be that the CAR-T cells are turned-off by the physical environment surround solid tumors. By inhibiting
NR2F6, we expect our DuraCar cells to have greater efficacy and persistence than conventional CAR-T cells and create a new, optimal way
to manufacture CAR-T cells. We are currently in pre-clinical testing of this drug. 

 Experiments
performed on behalf of the Company by two unrelated contract research organizations (CROs) found that T cells which express the chimeric
antigen receptor (CAR) construct targeting CD19 and expressing siRNA for NR2F6 had high expression levels of NR2F6 mRNA. NR2F6 is considered
an immune checkpoint and thus increasing its activity is likely to lead to immune suppression which may be utilized in the development
of therapies for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. 

9 

Small
molecule: We have identified and patented a series of small molecules which can both activate and inhibit NR2F6. NR2F6 normally acts
as a brake on the ability of various immune cells from being activated and also allows tumor cells to keep growing. By inhibiting the
function of NR2F6 using small molecules, immune cells that are treated with the NR2F6-blocking agents, similar to using the shRNA approach,
should become highly activated and efficiently kill tumors. In addition, tumors that have NR2F6 blocked by using these small molecules
should begin to differentiate. Conversely, activating NR2F6 is expected to suppress the immune system. This ability to suppress the immune
system can be very useful for treating autoimmune disorders. We are currently in pre-clinical testing of these drugs. 

 None
of the abovementioned statements regarding any of our products in development are intended to be a prediction or conclusion of efficacy.
No clinical trials on our product candidates have commenced so no conclusions of efficacy can be made. 

 Research
Conducted 

 The
Company has begun development of HemaXellerate, a cellular therapy designed to heal damaged bone marrow. HemaXellerate is a patient-specific
composition of cells that have been demonstrated to repair damaged bone marrow and stimulate production of blood cells based in previous
animal studies. The initial application of HemaXellerate will be the treatment of severe aplastic anemia which is characterized by immune-mediated
bone marrow hypoplasia (underdevelopment or incomplete development of a tissue) and pancytopenia (reduction in the number of blood cells
and platelets). 

 Adipose
tissue is collected from the patient and processed in order to separate, extract and isolate Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF), a mix of
various cell types including mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells. Mesenchymal stem cells are connective tissue cells that can
differentiate into a variety of cell types and endothelial cells are the cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels and lymphatic
vessels and which play a vital role in angiogenesis (the physiological process through which new blood vessels form from pre-existing
vessels). 

 The
isolated SVF is then intravenously administered to the patient. The Company believes that the isolated SVF will generate growth factors
with the ability to repair damaged hematopoietic stem cells. Hematopoietic stem cells are immature cells that can develop into all types
of blood cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Hematopoietic stem cells are found in the peripheral blood
and the bone marrow. 

 On
February 5, 2013 Regen filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA to initiate a Phase I clinical trial assessing HemaXellerate in patients with drug-refractory aplastic anemia. The Phase I clinical trial
is intended to determine safety and potential efficacy of intravenously administered autologous SVF cells in patients with severe, immune
suppressive refractory aplastic anemia with the primary endpoints of safety and feasibility and secondary endpoints of efficacy as determined
by patients having complete response, partial response or relapse. 

 Under
the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a previously unapproved drug or biologic intended to
treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the
United States. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication
for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven year period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from
approving another marketing application for the same drug for that time period. The sponsor of the product would also be entitled to
a United States federal tax credit equal to 50 of clinical investigation expenses as well as exemptions from certain fees. 

 The
Company believes that this application of HemaXellerate qualifies for Orphan designation under the Orphan Drug Act due to the fact that
aplastic anemia is a rare disease with prevalence in the United States of less than 200,000 and intends to apply to the FDA for Orphan
designation for HemaXellerate. 

 On
December 10, 2015 Regen was informed by the United States Food and Drug Administration that Regen has satisfactorily addressed all clinical
hold issues related to Regen s Investigational New Drug Application for HemaXellerate and may initiate a Phase I clinical trial
assessing HemaXellerate in patients with drug-refractory aplastic anemia. The Phase I clinical trial is intended to determine safety
and potential efficacy of intravenously administered autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells in patients with severe, immune
suppressive refractory aplastic anemia with the primary endpoints of safety and feasibility and secondary endpoints of efficacy as determined
by patients having complete response, partial response or relapse. 

10 

The
costs to perform this Phase I clinical trial is estimated to be approximately 5,000,000 and it is estimated to take 1 year to complete. 

 The
company is developing another cell therapy product termed dCellVax. dCellVax is intended to be a therapy whereby dendritic cells of the
cancer patient are harvested from the body, treated with siRNA that has the ability to block the dendritic cell from expressing indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase IDO and subsequently reimplanted in the cancer patient. 

 The
dendritic cells that are treated with the IDO-blocking RNA become resistant to the influence of tumor cells which produce factors which
cause the dendritic cell to express the IDO. Expression of IDO in the dendritic cell halts the dendritic cell from activating T cells
and causes the dendritic cell to suppress T cells. T lymphocytes T cells are a lymphocyte that play a central role in
the human immune system s attempt to eradicate tumors. The Company has filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with
the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial assessing safety with signals
of efficacy of the dCellVax gene-silenced dendritic cell immunotherapy for treating breast cancer. The proposed trial will recruit 10
patients with metastatic breast cancer and will involve 4 monthly injections of the dCellVax gene-silenced dendritic cell therapy. The
trial is anticipated to cost 5,000,000 and last one year, with tumor assessment before therapy and at 6 and 12 months.

marks the first step taken by the Company with regard to activating the Company s currently inactive applications to initiate clinical
trials. 

 Another
cell therapy that focuses on a different mechanism of action than dCellVax is tCellVax. tCellVax is intended to be a therapy in which
immune cells are removed from the cancer patient, treated with siRNA which inhibits NR2F6 and the cells re-infused to the patient. NR2F6
normally acts as a brake on the ability of various immune cells from being activated. The immune cells that are treated with the NR2F6-blocking

NR2F6 expression or that this inhibition will not result in immune cells with enhanced tumoricidal activity.

By inhibiting NR2F6, we expect our DuraCar cells to have greater efficacy and persistence than conventional CAR-T cells and create a

of this drug. Pre-clinical testing includes design and construction of the relevant plasmids, efficient transfection of T cells, assessment
of the expression levels of the siRNA directed at NR2F6 and measurement of its effectiveness at inhibition of NR2F6 expression. Then,
these cells will be analyzed for enhanced tumor-killing activity. The two main risks associated with this drug development plan is that
the NR2F6 siRNA is not effective at inhibiting NR2F6 expression or that this inhibition will not result in a T cell with enhanced tumoricidal
activity. Successful completion of these pre-clinical experiments will significantly de-risk the project.

 Distribution
methods of the products or services: 

 It
is anticipated that Regen and /or KCL will enter into licensing and/or sublicensing agreements with outside entities in order that Regen
and/or KCL may obtain royalty income on the products and services which it may develop and commercialize. 

 Competitive
business conditions and Regen s competitive position in the industry and methods of competition 

 We
have yet to achieve significant revenues or profits. The pharmaceutical and biologics industries in which we intend to compete are highly
competitive and characterized by rapid technological advancement. Many of our competitors have greater resources than we do. 

 We
intend to be competitive by utilizing the services and advice of individuals that we believe have expertise in their field in order that
we can concentrate our resources on projects in which products and services in which we have the greatest potential to secure a competitive
advantage may be developed and commercialized. The Company s intent is to enter into nonemployee consulting agreements with individuals
who we believe have a high level of expertise in their professional fields and who have agreed to provide counsel and assistance to us
in (a) determining the viability of proposed projects (b) obtaining financing for projects and (c) obtaining the resources required to
initiate and complete a project in the most cost effective and rapid manner. 

 Sources
and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers 

 The

a wide variety of sources. 

 Need
for any government approval of principal products or services, effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business. 

12 

The
US Food and Drug Administration FDA and foreign regulatory authorities will regulate our proposed products as drugs or
biologics, , depending upon such factors as the use to which the product will be put, the chemical composition, and the interaction of
the product on the human body. In the United States, products that are intended to be introduced into the body will generally be regulated
as drugs, while tissues and cells intended for transplant into the human body will be generally be regulated as biologics. 

 Our
domestic human drug and biological products will be subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals,
an Investigational New Drug Application IND must be filed with the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing. Extensive
clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal
use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. 

 Phase
I 

 Phase
1 trials are designed to assess the safety (pharmacovigilance), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a drug. These
trials are often conducted in an inpatient clinic, where the subject can be observed by full-time staff. The subject who receives the
drug is usually observed until several half-lives of the drug have passed. Phase I trials normally include dose-ranging, also called
dose escalation, studies so that the appropriate dose for therapeutic use can be found. The tested range of doses usually are a fraction
of the dose that causes harm in animal testing and involve a small group of healthy volunteers. However, there are some circumstances
when real patients are used, such as patients who have end-stage disease and lack other treatment options. 

 Phase
II 

 Phase
II trials are designed to assess how well the drug or biologic works, as well as to continue Phase I safety assessments in a larger group
of volunteers and patients. Phase II trials are performed on larger groups. 

 Phase
III 

 Phase
III trials are aimed at being the definitive assessment of how effective the product is in comparison with current best standard treatment
and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase III trials may also be conducted for the purposes of (i) label
expansion (to show the product works for additional types of patients/diseases beyond the original use for which the drug was
approved for marketing or (ii) to obtain additional safety data, or to support marketing claims for the product. 

 On
occasion Phase IV (Post Approval) trials may be required by the FDA. Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance (pharmacovigilance)
and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives permission to be sold.The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare
or long-term adverse effects over a much larger patient population and longer time period than was possible during the Phase I-III clinical
trials. 

 All
phases, must be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans.
Each clinical study is conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board IRB ). The IRB will consider,
among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. The time and expense
required to perform this clinical testing can far exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create
the product. No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the United States until an appropriate New Drug Application NDA or Biologic License Application BLA or has been approved by the FDA. FDA regulations also restrict
the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to NDA or BLA approval. 

 Even
after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain approval
for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted. In addition, use of these products
during testing and after marketing could reveal side effects that could delay, impede, or prevent FDA marketing approval, resulting in
FDA-ordered product recall, or in FDA-imposed limitations on permissible. 

13 

The
FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, and human tissue and cell products, requiring that they be produced
in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices cGMP ). The FDA also regulates the content of advertisements used
to market pharmaceutical products. Generally, claims made in advertisements concerning the safety and efficacy of a product, or any advantages
of a product over another product, must be supported by clinical data filed as part of an NDA or an amendment to an NDA, and statements
regarding the use of a product must be consistent with the FDA approved labeling and dosage information for that product. 

 Sales
of drugs and biologics outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country.
Even if FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained
prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The time required to obtain such approval may be longer or shorter
than that required for FDA approval

 Item
5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

 The
Company s common stock is a penny stock, as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules
require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk
disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer
also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its
sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account.
In addition, the penny stock rules require that the broker-dealer, not otherwise exempt from such rules, must make a special written
determination that the penny stock is suitable for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These
disclosure rules have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to
the penny stock rules. So long as the common stock of the Company is subject to the penny stock rules, it may be more difficult to sell
common stock of the Company. 

 The
par value of our common stock is 0.0001. There are 5,800,000,000 shares authorized and 3,558,861 shares issued and outstanding as of

 As
of September 30, 2023 we had Cash of 121,037 and as of September 30, 2022 we had cash of 51,204. The increase in cash of approximately
137 is primarily attributable to: 

(a) 243,750
 in net cash proceeds received by the Company through the issuances of Notes Payable

 in combined minimum royalty and anniversary fees paid to the Company by Zander Therapeutics,

Party of 295,466. The decrease in Accounts Receivable, Related Party is attributable to the payment to the Company by Zander Therapeutics,
Inc. of all licensing fees due and payable. 

 As
of September 30, 2023 we had Prepaid Expenses of 0 and as of September 30, 2022 we had prepaid expenses of 20,945. The decrease in
Prepaid Expenses is attributable to the recognition of expenses incurred over the nine months ended June 30, 2023 resulting from an agreement

is from July 1, 2021 to July 1, 2023. The total consideration due of 55,000 was paid to the contractor as of July 1, 2021 and was being

The decrease in Accrued Interest Payable of approximately 50.4 is attributable to the issuance of equity securities of the Company during
the quarter ended December 31, 2022 in satisfaction of 405,631 of interest accrued but unpaid on Convertible Notes issued by the Company
offset by additional interest accrued but unpaid during the year ended September 30, 2023 on Notes Payable and Convertible
Notes Payable. 

 As
of September 30, 2023 we had total Convertible Notes Payable of 509,880 and as of September 30, 2022 we had total Convertible Notes
Payable of 1,272,340. The decrease in total Convertible Notes Payable of approximately 60 is attributable to the conversion of 761,500
of convertible indebtedness into shares of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock as well as the derecognition of 1,000 of convertible
indebtedness. 

 As
of September 30, 2023 we had Unearned Income of 1,591,731 and as of September 30, 2022 we had Unearned Income of 1,798,290. Unearned

Operating Loss of 339,605 for the same period ended 2022. The large disparity in Operating Losses is primarily attributable to 606,237

Research and Development expenses) were greater during the twelve months ended 2023 as compared to the same period ended 2022. The Company

 REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

 To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Regen Biopharma, Inc.: 

 Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regen Biopharma, Inc. (the "Company") as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the two years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two years in the period ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

 Going
Concern Matter 

 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

 Basis
for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Critical
Audit Matter 

 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 

 We
determined that there are no critical audit matters.

 for the years ended September 30, 2022
and September 30, 2023. 

In
August 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-15 Preparation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic
205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Under generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP), continuation of a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements
unless and until the entity s liquidation becomes imminent. Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly
referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. If and when an entity s liquidation becomes imminent, financial statements
should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 205-30, Presentation of Financial Statements Liquidation
Basis of Accounting. Even when an entity s liquidation is not imminent, there may be conditions or events that raise substantial
doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. In those situations, financial statements should continue to be
prepared under the going concern basis of accounting, but the amendments in this Update should be followed to determine whether to disclose
information about the relevant conditions and events. The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after
December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company will evaluate the
going concern considerations in this ASU, however, at the current period, management does not believe that it has met the conditions
which would subject these financial statements for additional disclosure. 

 On
January 31, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update [ASU] 2013-01, entitled Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting
Assets and Liabilities. The guidance in ASU 2013-01 amends the requirements in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification [FASB ASC]
Topic 210, entitled Balance Sheet. The ASU 2013-01 amendments to FASB ASC 210 clarify that ordinary trade receivables and receivables
in general are not within the scope of ASU 2011-11, entitled Disclosure about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, where that ASU amended
the guidance in FASB ASC 210. As those disclosures now are modified with the ASU 2013-01 amendments, the FASB ASC 210 balance sheet offsetting
disclosures now clearly are applicable only where reporting entities are involved with bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements,
reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions that either are offset using the FASB ASC 210 or 815
requirements, or that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements. ASU 2013-01 is effective for annual
reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this ASU is
not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. 

 On
February 28, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update [ASU] 2013-04, entitled Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability
Arrangements for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date. The ASU 2013-04 amendments add to the guidance
in FASB Accounting Standards Codification [FASB ASC] Topic 405, entitled Liabilities and require reporting entities to measure obligations
resulting from certain joint and several liability arrangements where the total amount of the obligation is fixed as of the reporting
date, as the sum of the following: 

 The
amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among co-obligors. 

 Any
additional amounts the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. 

 While
early adoption of the amended guidance is permitted, for public companies, the guidance is required to be implemented in fiscal years,
and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. The amendments need to be implemented retrospectively to all
prior periods presented for obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements that exist at the beginning of the year
of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2013-04 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s operating results or financial
position. 

 On
April 22, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update [ASU] 2013-07, entitled Liquidation Basis of Accounting. With ASU 2013-07,
the FASB amends the guidance in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification [FASB ASC] Topic 205, entitled Presentation of Financial Statements.
The amendments serve to clarify when and how reporting entities should apply the liquidation basis of accounting. The guidance is applicable
to all reporting entities, whether they are public or private companies or not-for-profit entities. The guidance also provides principles
for the recognition of assets and liabilities and disclosures, as well as related financial statement presentation requirements. The
requirements in ASU 2013-07 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013, and interim reporting periods
within those annual periods. Reporting entities are required to apply the requirements in ASU 2013-07 prospectively from the day that
liquidation becomes imminent. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2013-07 is not expected to have a material effect on the
Company s operating results or financial position. 

In
January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, which amends
the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect
the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements
for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred
tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and
interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is
not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from
instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 as of the fiscal year ending September
30, 2019. 

 In
August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity; Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ),
as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or
improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes
from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component,
unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium.
As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity, and
will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the if-converted method
when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Company s current
accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the
fiscal year. The Company has adopted ASU 2020-06 as of the Fiscal Year ending September 30, 2022. 

 A
variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and various
regulatory agencies. Due to the tentative and preliminary nature of those proposed standards, the Company s management has
not determined whether implementation of such standards would be material to its financial statements. 

 during the period from April 24, 2012 (inception) through September 30, 2023. This condition raises
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern
is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

 On
September 12, 2023 the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the Equity Line Agreement with Coventry
Enterprises LLC Coventry providing for an equity financing facility (the Equity Line ). The Equity Line
Agreement provides that upon the terms and subject to the conditions in the Equity Line Agreement, Coventry is committed to purchase
up to Ten Million Dollars of shares of common stock, par value per share (the Common Stock ), over
the 36-month term of the Equity Line Agreement (the Total Commitment ). 

 Under
the terms of the Equity Line Agreement, Coventry will not be obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock unless and until certain conditions
are met, including but not limited to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the Registration Statement becoming effective
which registers Coventry s resale of any Common Stock purchased by Coventry under the Equity Line. 

From
time to time over the 36-month term of the Commitment Period as such term is defined in the Equity Line Agreement) the Company, in
its sole discretion, may provide Coventry with a draw down notice (each, a Draw Down Notice ), to purchase a specified number
of shares of Common Stock (each, a Draw Down Amount Requested ), subject to the limitations discussed below. The actual
amount of proceeds the Company will receive pursuant to each Draw Down Notice (each, a Draw Down Amount is to be determined
by multiplying the Draw Down Amount Requested by the applicable purchase price. The purchase price of each share of Common Stock equals
 of the lowest trading price of the Common Stock during the ten business days prior to the Draw Down Notice date (the Pricing
Period ). 

 The
maximum number of shares of Common Stock requested to be purchased pursuant to any single Draw Down Notice cannot exceed the lesser of
(i) of the Average Daily Traded Value as such term is defined in the Equity Line Agreement) during the ten business days immediately
preceding the Drawdown Notice Date or (ii) . The Company is prohibited from delivering a Draw Down Notice if the sale of shares
of Common Stock pursuant to the Draw Down Notice would cause the Company to issue and sell to Coventry or Coventry to acquire or purchase
an aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that would result in Coventry beneficially owning more than 4.99 of the issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock of the Company. 

 The
Company issued Coventry shares of its Common Stock in connection with the Equity Line Agreement. 

 Coventry
has agreed that: 

(a) for
 so long as the market price of the Company s common stock is above per share
 and 

(b) the
 Company is in full compliance with all agreements entered into with Coventry and 

(c) and
 the Company has not issued any common shares at a per share price below , Coventry will
 agree to a leak out provision and will not sell more than shares of the Commitment
 shares without permission from the Issuer. 

In
connection with the Equity Line Agreement the Company also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated September 12, 2023 with
Coventry (the Registration Rights Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to register for resale under the Securities
Act of 1933 shares issuable in accordance with the Equity Line Agreement as well as the aforementioned common shares issued in
connection with the Equity Line Agreement in a Registration Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Up to
 Shares of Common Stock were registered for resale under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement.

As
of September 30 2023 the Company has a Deferred Tax Asset of completely attributable to net operating loss carry forwards
of approximately . The amount and availability of any net operating loss carryforward will be subject to the limitations
set forth in the Internal Revenue Code. Such factors as the number of shares ultimately issued within a three-year look-back period;
whether there is a deemed more than 50 change in control; the applicable long-term tax exempt bond rate; continuity of historical business;
and subsequent income of the Company all enter into the annual computation of allowable annual utilization of any net operating loss
carryforward. 

 Realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient future taxable income during the period that deductible temporary differences and
carry forwards are expected to be available to reduce taxable income. The achievement of required future taxable income is uncertain. 

 A
corporation is considered to undergo an ownership change if, as a result of changes in the stock ownership by 5-percent
shareholders or as a result of certain reorganizations, the percentage of the corporation s stock owned by those 5-percent
shareholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock owned by those shareholders at any time
during the prior three-year testing period. Five-percent shareholders are persons who hold 5 or more of the stock of a corporation at
any time during the testing period as well as certain groups of shareholders (based typically on whether they acquired their shares in
a single offering or exchange transaction) who are not individually 5-percent shareholders. 

 As
the Company will require cash infusions in order to implement its business plan, and as it is probable, although not guaranteed, that
such funding needs may be met through the sale of equity securities to 5-percent shareholders , the Company recognized a
valuation allowance equal to the deferred Tax Asset and the Company recorded a valuation allowance reducing all deferred tax assets to
0.

9A. Controls and Procedures 

 a)
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 

 The
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as
of September 30, 2023. Based on this evaluation, they have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure
that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms
and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. David Koos
is the Company s CEO and functions as the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer respectively. 

 b)
Management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting. 

 Management
of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 13a-15(f) defines internal control over financial reporting
as follows: 

 The
term internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the issuer's principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the issuer's board of directors,
management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies
and procedures that: 

 Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the issuer; 

 Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the issuer; and 

 Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer's assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

 The
Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company s management
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

 In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only a reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure
controls and procedures are met. 

 The
Company s management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 is based
on the framework in 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. Based on its assessment, management
believes that, as of September 30, 2023 the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective. 

 Management's
report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management's report in this annual report. This exemption for smaller
reporting companies provided under the temporary rules referenced above has been made permanent under Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 

 (c)
There have been no changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

Code
of Ethics 

 On
September 25, 2013 we adopted a Code of Ethics pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

 Director
Independence 

 Audit
Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert 

 The
members of the Company s board of Directors may not be considered independent. The Company is not a listed company 
under Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and is therefore not required to have an audit committee comprised
of independent directors. The Company does not currently have an audit committee, however, for certain purposes of the rules and regulations
of the SEC and in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company s Board of Directors is deemed to be its audit committee
and as such functions as an audit committee and performs some of the same functions as an audit committee including: (1) selection and
oversight of our independent accountant; (2) establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding
accounting, internal controls and auditing matters; and (3) engaging outside advisors. The Board of Directors has determined that its
member is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements and has substantial business experience that results in that member's
financial sophistication. Accordingly, the Board of Directors believes that its member has the sufficient knowledge and experience necessary
to fulfill the duties and obligations that an audit committee would have. 

 Nominating
and Compensation Committees 

 The
Company does not have standing nominating or compensation committees, or committees performing similar functions. The board of directors
believes that it is not necessary to have a compensation committee at this time because the functions of such committee are adequately
performed by the board of directors. The board of directors also is of the view that it is appropriate for the Company not to have a
standing nominating committee because the board of directors has performed and will perform adequately the functions of a nominating
committee. The Company is not a listed company under SEC rules and is therefore not required to have a compensation committee
or a nominating committee. 

 Shareholder
Communications 

 There
has not been any defined policy or procedure requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations or nomination for directors. There
are no specific, minimum qualifications that the board of directors believes must be met by a candidate recommended by the board of directors.
Currently, the entire board of directors decides on nominees, on the recommendation of any member of the board of directors followed
by the board s review of the candidates resumes and interview of candidates. Based on the information gathered, the board
of directors then makes a decision on whether to recommend the candidates as nominees for director. The Company does not pay any fee
to any third party or parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating potential nominee. 

50 

Because
the Chief Executive Officer of the Company is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, the Board of Directors has
determined not to adopt a formal methodology for communications from shareholders on the belief that any communication would be brought
to the Board of Directors attention by virtue of the co-extensive capacities of the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Director
Independence 

 Audit
Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert 

 The
Company s Board of Directors may not be considered independent as the sole director is also an officer. The Company
is not a listed company under Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and is therefore not
required to have an audit committee comprised of independent directors. The Company does not currently have an audit committee, however,
for certain purposes of the rules and regulations of the SEC and in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company s Board
of Directors is deemed to be its audit committee and as such functions as an audit committee and performs some of the same functions
as an audit committee including: (1) selection and oversight of our independent accountant; (2) establishing procedures for the receipt,
retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal controls and auditing matters; and (3) engaging outside advisors.
The Board of Directors has determined that its members are able to read and understand fundamental financial statements and has substantial
business experience that results in the member's financial sophistication. Accordingly, the Board of Directors believes that its
members have the sufficient knowledge and experience necessary to fulfill the duties and obligations that an audit committee would have. 

 Nominating
and Compensation Committees 

 The
Company does not have standing nominating or compensation committees, or committees performing similar functions. The Board
of Directors believes that it is not necessary to have a compensation committee at this time because the functions of such committee
are adequately performed by the board of directors. The Board of Directors also is of the view that it is appropriate for the Company
not to have a standing nominating committee because the Board of Directors has performed and will perform adequately the functions of
a nominating committee. The Company is not a listed company under SEC rules and is therefore not required to have
a compensation committee or a nominating committee. 

 Shareholder
Communications 

 There
has not been any defined policy or procedure requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations or nomination for directors. There
are no specific, minimum qualifications that the board of directors believes must be met by a candidate recommended by the board of directors.
Currently, the entire board of directors decides on nominees, on the recommendation of any member of the board of directors followed
by the board s review of the candidates resumes and interview of candidates. Based on the information gathered, the board
of directors then makes a decision on whether to recommend the candidates as nominees for director. The Company does not pay any fee
to any third party or parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating potential nominee. 

 The
Board of Directors has determined not to adopt a formal methodology for communications from shareholders on the belief that any communication
would be brought to the board of directors attention by virtue of communication with management.
