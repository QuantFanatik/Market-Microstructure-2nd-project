History 

The Company was
incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 17, 2014 under the name Asteriko Corp. Our prior business plan, which generated limited
or no earnings, included interior decorating products, and a travel and tourism service. On May 14, 2018, our current Chairman, President
and director, Richard Carey, acquired approximately 62.15 ownership of the Company, constituting a change of control transaction. On
January 6, 2017, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation, effecting the change of its name to Star Alliance International
Corp. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company does not have subsidiaries. 

Troy Acquisition 

On August 13, 2019, the
Company acquired the assets of Troy Mining Corp, a Nevada corporation pursuant to the asset purchase agreement dated June 13, 2019 (the
 Troy Asset Acquisition ), which included 78 gold mining claims consisting of approximately 4800 acres, located east/southeast
of El Portal, California, in Mariposa County, together with all of Troy s rights to related equipment and buildings currently located
on the mining claims, including a production processing mill together with associated buildings, all the mining and support equipment
at the Troy mine site, all the Troy mining claims, and related geological reports relating to the property, assay reports on the property,
and all core drilling samples. In consideration for the Troy Asset Acquisition, the Company issued to Troy a promissory note in principal
amount of 500,000 (the Purchase Note ), and 1,883,000 shares of a Series B Preferred Stock. The Purchase Note was repaid
in full in April, 2022. The Company is currently working with the US Forest Service, National Park Service and BLM to finalize the permits
to reopen the mine. No permits have been issued yet. The Company expects to restart mining operations in 2024. 

Share Purchase Agreements with Juan Lemus
for the proposed acquisitions of 51 ownership in Commsa and Lion Works. 

On December 15, 2021, the Company entered into
a share purchase agreement (the Share Purchase Agreement with Juan Lemus, the sole shareholder of Commsa. The Share Purchase
Agreement contemplated the acquisition by the Company of 51 of the share capital of Commsa, a newly-formed company, which has the mining
rights to five operating mines that run along a 12.5-mile stretch of the Rio Jalan River, in consideration for 1,000,000 in cash and
the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock to Mr. Lemus (the Commsa Acquisition ). In addition,
the Company has agreed to provide up to 7,500,000 in working capital to expand the mining operations in a gold mining project (Rio Jalan
Project) in Olancho state in the highlands of Central Honduras. The Company did not meet its obligations for the consummation of the Commsa
Acquisition by March 31, 2022 as set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement; however, the parties did not terminate the Share Purchase
Agreement, intending that the Company would be able to obtain the necessary funding later and to consummate the Commsa Acquisition. 

On August 14, 2023, the Company and Juan Lemus
executed an addendum to the Share Exchange Agreement (the which provided for the extension of the Company s obligations to pay 1,000,000
in cash, the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock to Mr. Lemus and the payment of 7,500,000 in working capital
until September 30, 2023. The first addendum provides that if the Company does not comply with these obligations set forth in the Addendum
until September 30, 2023, the Share Purchase Agreement will be null and void. On September 28, 2023, the parties executed the second addendum,
extending the timing of the Company s payment from September 30, 2023 to December 31, 2023. 

3 

On March 19, 2023, the Company entered into and
executed a share purchase agreement (the Share Purchase Agreement with Lion Works and Juan Lemus, the sole shareholder
of Lion Works, which contemplated the acquisition by the Company, as Buyer, from Mr. Lemus, as Seller, of 51 of the capital stock of
Lion Works, including 51 of the intellectual property rights and know-how related to the Genesis extraction system Genesis ),
The Share Purchase Agreement superseded the terms of the binding Letter of Intent that the parties entered into on November 21, 2021.
Pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company s consideration for the acquisition of 51 of Lion Works consists
of the following: 

The total purchase price of 5,100,000 in cash, with the first minimum payment in the amount of 2,550,000 to be paid by September 30, 2023, and the remaining outstanding balance of 2,550,000 to be paid by September 30, 2024, within 12 months of the first payment. 

The Company will invest an additional 5,000,000 as a working capital toward the development of the Genesis plants, with 2,000,000 to be paid by July 31, 2023, and the remaining 3,000,000 to be paid by July 31, 2024, within 12 months of the first payment. 

The Company will engage a patent attorney and pay for the cost of that patent attorney to prepare the patent application related to Genesis and to register that patent, provided that Lion Works will engage an expert to prepare a report on the Genesis system, to be used in this patent application. 

The parties agreed that the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement will occur on or before March 19, 2023 or at such other time and place as the Buyer and the
Seller may agree, provided that (i) the Seller receives the first tranche of working capital funds in the amount of 2,000 prior to the
execution and delivery of (i) the paperwork necessary for the attorney to complete the patent submission, (ii) all documentation necessary
for the buyer to market the Genesis program, (iii) any other document, certificate or instrument to consummate the transactions contemplated
by the Share Purchase Agreement. 

On July 21, 2023, Juan Lemus and the Company executed
the first addendum to the Share Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company s obligations to pay 2,000,000 as working capital
was extended until September 30, 2023, and the parties agreed that upon such payment and the first minimum payment in the amount of 2,550,000
toward the total purchase price on or prior to September 30, 2023 by the Company, the parties will close the transactions contemplated
by the Share Purchase Agreement, and Lion Works will become a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company. On September 28, 2023, the parties
executed the second addendum, which extended the terms of the Company s payments to December 31, 2023. 

Purchase Agreement and Registration
Rights Agreement with Keystone. 

On March 15, 2023, the Company entered into and
executed the Purchase Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement with Keystone, pursuant to which the Company shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to direct Keystone, an unrelated third party, to purchase up to 75,000,000 shares of its Common Stock (the Shares ),
pursuant to separate purchase notices to be delivered by the Company to Keystone from time to time (each, a Purchase Notice ).
The Purchase Agreement provides that each Purchase Notice may be for not less than 20,000 and not more than 75,000 worth of the Company s
Common Stock. The price per share of Common Stock shall be eighty-five percent (85 of the average of the closing prices per share of
the Company s Common Stock for five (5) trading days preceding the purchase. 

4 

Our ability to require Keystone to purchase the
Shares under the Purchase Agreement is subject to various limitations and conditions, including but not limited to the following: 

The Company shall have performed, satisfied and complied in all material respects with all covenants, agreements and conditions required by the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement to be performed, satisfied or complied with by the Company; 

The Company shall deliver to Keystone on the Commencement Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) the compliance certificate executed by the Company s executive officer 

The initial registration statement, which covers the resale by Keystone of the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), including the Commitment Shares and the shares to be issued pursuant to the Purchase Notice, shall have been declared effective under the Securities Act by the SEC, and Keystone shall be permitted to utilize the prospectus therein to resell (a) all of the Commitment Shares and (b) all of the Shares included in that prospectus 

The applicable purchase price for each Purchase Notice must be not less than 0.01 per share 

At least five (5) trading days must have passed since the last Purchase Notice 

The Company s Common Stock must be DWAC eligible 

Keystone s beneficial ownership of the Company s common stock is limited such that Keystone may not purchase shares of Star s common stock to the extent that, immediately following such purchase, Keystone would own more than 4.99 of Star s total issued and outstanding common stock. 

Selling Stockholder shall have received an opinion from our outside legal counsel in the form previously agreed to. 

Trading of the Company s Common Stock shall not have been suspended by the SEC, the Trading Market or the FINRA 

In consideration for
Keystone entering into the Purchase Agreement and to induce Keystone to execute and deliver the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed
to issue to Keystone 1,000,000 Commitment Shares (as defined below). In addition, the Company agreed to provide Keystone with certain
registration rights with respect to the Commitment Shares, and additional shares, including 500,000 shares of Common Stock to be issued
to Keystone on the date the initial registration statement is declared effective, and 2,274,588 shares of the Company s Common Stock
having an aggregate dollar value of 75,000 upon the investment by Keystone of more than 500,000 in the Company under the Purchase Agreement
(collectively, the Additional Shares ). The Commitment Shares issued and the Additional Shares that may be issued to Keystone
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement were issued and will be issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. 

There is no guarantee
that we will be able to meet the foregoing conditions or any other conditions under the Purchase Agreement or that we will be able to
draw down any portion of the amounts available under the Purchase Agreement. 

Pursuant to the Registration
Rights Agreement, on June 15, 2023, we filed the registration statement on Form S-1 (SEC File No. 333-272671), as amended on August 28,
2023, to register for resale by Keystone up to 75,000,000 shares of Common Stock that may purchase under the Purchase Agreement (the Initial
Registration Statement ). The effectiveness of the Initial Registration Statement is a condition precedent to our ability to sell
shares of our Common Stock to Keystone under the Purchase Agreement. The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to amend
the Initial Registration Statement or file a new registration statement, to cover all of such Registrable Securities, subject to any limits
that may be imposed by the SEC pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. 

5 

Smaller Reporting Company Status 

We qualify as a smaller reporting company 
under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than 75 million. To the extent
that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure
requirements for our public filings, some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company, including not being required to
comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. 

Business Overview 

We are an exploration-stage
company that focuses on acquisition and development of gold mining and other mining properties worldwide, environmentally safe technologies
both in mining and other business areas. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not commenced our mining operations. We anticipate
starting our mining operations in 2024. We are also exploring acquisitions of assets or majority
interests in companies related to artificial intelligence technology and in the fintech arena acquiring proprietary software technology.
At this time, the Company is negotiating the terms of these potential acquisitions and once these
terms are finalized, we will enter into one or more definitive agreements. 

The Company requires
substantial funding and additional work to implement its business plan with respect to its mining properties, including the acquisitions
of 51 ownership in both (a) Compania Minera Metalurgica Centro Americana, a Honduran Corporation Commsa ). and (b) Lion
Works Advertising, SA, a Guatemalan corporation Lion Works ), a company that owns the Genesis ore extraction
process, as described below. If we complete these acquisitions and acquire the intellectual property rights to Genesis, we will grow our
business and will be able to build a number of Genesis plants that can be placed in customer mining sites including our own Troy mining
site. After we complete these acquisitions, we also need to purchase the equipment necessary and obtain a final mining permit, to start
operation in Honduras and to use Genesis technology. 

Acquisition Strategy 

Our
acquisition strategy is to acquire gold mining and other mining properties worldwide, environmentally safe technologies both in
mining and other business areas that will help us to grow and to enhance our overall monetization
strategy. Particularly, the Company is focused on the acquisition of companies or majority interests in companies that are employing highly
specialized, environmentally safe and patented technologies for the extraction of gold, silver and other metals including lithium and
rare earth elements with an additional focus on biodegradable technologies that will dramatically improve many everyday applications. 

As
of the date of this Annual Report, we are also exploring acquisitions of assets and majority interests in companies related to artificial
intelligence technology and in the fintech arena. We are currently negotiating the terms of these potential acquisitions and once these
terms are final, we will enter into one or more definitive agreements. 

Troy Asset Acquisition 

As a result of the Troy
Asset Acquisition, the Company acquired 78 gold mining claims consisting of approximately 1600 acres, located east/southeast of El Portal,
California, in Mariposa County, together with all of Troy s rights to related equipment and buildings currently located on the mining
claims, including a production processing mill together with associated buildings, all the mining and support equipment at the Troy mine
site, all the Troy mining claims, and related geological reports relating to the property, assay reports on the property, and all core
drilling samples. 

6 

The federal government
became involved in the gold mine when prosecuting the then owner and made a request of Dr. Robert B. Garcia to place an estimated value
upon the project. Mr. Garcia has a long history as a developer, owner and operator of numerous mines and mining companies and a consultant
for the mining and precious metal industries. He graduated from Arizona State University with a degree in chemistry, but his vocational
experience is mainly as a metallurgist. He also consults within the mining industry as an expert witness in court litigation s
and has served as an assay referee in large bulk precious metals purchases and evaluations of mine properties for ore values and is a
Board of Directors member of a Swiss Bullion License, duly appointed and registered with the Swiss Government which is why the federal
government chose him as its consultant for this project. Mr. Garcia s testimony under oath to the court on behalf of the federal
government were significant and resulted in Star s acquisition of the mine from the current owners. 

This valuation was prepared
on August 5, 2004, and although this area has not been mined since 2002, the Company recognizes that a new Technical Report and Appraisal
prepared under US current standards and regulations with extensive core drilling is needed. Management intends to use some of the funds
raised from the S 1 registration to complete the drilling and updated valuation. 

The Company is currently
working with the US Forest Service, National Park Service and Bureau of land Management BLM to finalize the permits to
reopen the mine. No permits have been issued yet. The Company expects to restart mining operations in 2024. 

Previous Work on the
Troy Claims : 

The history of gold mining
in Mariposa County dates back to placer mining by Mexicans or Californians of Spanish descent in 1848. Details concerning work in this
time are limited. The discovery of lode gold in Mariposa is generally credited to Kit Carson and the discovery of the Mariposa mine in
1849; however, it is possible that the Mexicans were mining bedrock gold in Mariposa County prior to this discovery. 

Subsequent to this discovery,
large portions of Mariposa County were covered by land grants issued to John Fremont (The Las Mariposas Spanish Land Grant) and the Cook
Estate. Because these grants and their private administration covered much of the Mother Lode, mining and development of the area was
not conducted in the same fashion as claims located on public land. 

The 78 current mining
claims registered to Troy Mining Corporation are located west/southwest of El Portal, California and are located on BLM land. The claims
are accessible via California State route 140 with the prime portals located approximately two to two and one-half (2 2 miles east of Hwy 140 (based on a direct route). There is a graded dirt road that connects the portals located the greatest distance from
Hwy 140 with the highway that is owned and maintained by Star. This road is approximately eight (8) miles in length due to the many required
switch-backs in order to build the road into the side of the mountain. With proper maintenance, which can be accomplished by the mining
company using the equipment purchased for working the mine, this road is normally passable year-round. The road is shared with the US
Forest Service and National Park Service who use it to maintain visual surveillance of the area and for fire fighting access and as part
hiking trails. In addition to this road, there are additional roads owned by Star that connect the main portal with additional portals
located within the claim area. Further, the claims are located at what is considered to be the east base of what is commonly known as
the Mother Lode gold-quartz vein system. 

7 

Background of the Project: 

The Project is located at the base of the gold mother lode in one of
the three major vein belts where the greatest concentration of minerals settled over the years. 

The project consists of mining claims located upon land under the control of BLM, US Forest Service and the National Park Service not the state of California with oversight being by these three agencies. 

This is a hard rock mining project, not an open pit or placer type project resulting in much less oversight for air pollution and visual impact. 

It is not a start-up project; it is the reopening of an existing, recently worked, project. 

There is an existing grid of roads and trails that crisscross the project providing access to the prime portals. The roads are graded dirt that can be maintained as passable throughout the year and the trails can be expanded into passable roads. The estimated cost to build these roads and trails today would be in excess of 10 million. 

There is a gravity flow ball mill installed on the project that is complete from an ore introduction conveyor system and both rough and crushed ore bins with a pneumatic air hammer/blaster system, through the separation portion of the mill including water and other solutions storage tanks and circulating system and separation tables. This equipment has a replacement cost of approximately 1.8 million. 

On site there are two self-contained generators
connected to existing electrical distribution panels with an on-site replacement cost of approximately 30,000. The project has multiple
production shafts (portals) that have in-shaft railroad track installed. 

The project has sufficient timber located within the claim areas to both provide shoring material for new tunneling and if so desired, to sell the excess. 

While this is primarily a gold recovery project, geologists and assay reports indicate the amount of recoverable silver available in quantity is equal to that of gold which adds considerable to the bottom-line profit. 

The company has a large library of mining history
of the area and the production shafts located within the project boundaries along with extensive exploration and geology maps, reports. 

Overview of Previous Mining Operations
on the Troy Claims: 

There are three main
portals (Hite Mine, Gibbs/Williams Brothers Mine and the Gold Star Mine) located within the area currently included in the Troy mining
claims that have been worked from as early as 1849 to as recently as 1996 (Note: in total there are 17 portals on the property). These
mines have never been worked with modern equipment but have always been worked with dynamite and pick shovel with the ore being
transported via pack mule prior to the construction of the access road. The roadway system currently in place allows for the ore to be
moved via truck either to the processing mill located at the site of the main portal or to off-site locations if it should be desired
to do so. All of the mining done in this area is what is known as Hardrock or below-grade, tunnel mining. The past total production from
the mines located within this area is considerable. A large portion of this production was done when the price of gold was around 20
per ounce but based on today s prices this would be very significant. During the production years for these mines, the technique
followed by the Hardrock miners was known as drift mining where the miner located an external outcropping and then followed
the gold vein until it petered out then he moved to another outcropping location. Underground mining extended to 900 feet with development
extending down to 1200 feet in depth. Elsewhere on the property, mining and development all occurred within 100 feet of the surface.

Previous
Work on the Troy Claims: 

The history of gold mining
in Mariposa County dates back to placer mining by Mexicans or Californians of Spanish descent in 1848. Details concerning work in this
time are limited. The discovery of lode gold in Mariposa is generally credited to Kit Carson and the discovery of the Mariposa mine in
1849; however, it is possible that the Mexicans were mining bedrock gold in Mariposa County prior to this discovery. 

Subsequent to this discovery, large portions
of Mariposa County were covered by land grants issued to John Fremont (The Las Mariposas Spanish Land Grant) and the Cook Estate. Because
these grants and their private administration covered much of the Mother Lode, mining and development of the area was not conducted in
the same fashion as claims located on public land. 

MINE SUMMARY: 

The Mother Lode is the
most extensive mineral zone in the State of California. It extends from the southern part of Mariposa County to the northern part of El
Dorado County, a distance of 300 miles, then extends northeast along the Sierra Nevada foothills. Some of the most famous and productive
gold mines in the West are located along the length of this mineral zone. The Mother Lode Gold Belt is a long, narrow strip on the western
foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. There is a wall-like mass of quartz that outcrops at intervals along the belt. The wide
zone of parallel and discontinuous gold vein deposits is referred to as the Mother Lode System. 

Mariposa County, California,
has a long history of gold production from small lode and placer mining operations. The county covers part of the Sierra Nevada Mother
Lode belt first discovered in the 19th century. The majority of gold production occurred prior to 1900 and was taken from mineralized
quartz veins. The gold price at that time was 20.00/ounce compared to approximately 1,900 per ounce currently. The unproven production
at that time would have had a value of several billion dollars if current pricing was used. 

From the discovery of
gold at Sutter's Mill on the American River on January 24, 1848 to the present, the area known as the Mother Lode Region 
has been one of most prolific gold producing areas in the world. In 1849, Quartz lode mining began on claims that currently make up part
of the Troy Mining claims. Later this mine was one of the first to install a stamp mill, which ground the quartz ore to separate out the
free gold. 

The Troy Mining (Troy)
property is specifically located geologically, at the southern end of the Mother Lode System in Central East California,
Mariposa County, approximately 200 miles east of San Francisco. The property borders on the western the age of Yosemite National Park
in the El Portal, California quadrangle, and is three miles southwest of the town of the El Portal, California. The mining property is
bounded on the north by the Middle Fork of the Merced River and on the south by the South Fork of the Merced River. The property ranges
in elevation from 1,700 feet to 5,500 feet and with workers housed on-site, can be worked year-round. The claims in each of the two main
claim groups are contiguous. The maps and mine co-ordinates are included in this report. . 

The former AT E Company
controlled approximately 10,500 acres of ground in Mariposa County, California, covering 250 mining claims. The property was acquired
from AT E in the late 90 s by USA Mining and then the 79 most important claims were reinstated by Troy Mining in the early 2000 s Note : both these transactions occurred when gold was less than 300/oz). The property includes more than 50 mine portals dating
back to the late 1800 s or early 1900 s most of which have not been located and viewed by the current owner. Because of the
existence of historical mining records, nine of these mines have been characterized as former gold producing mines. Included in this list
of mines is the Hite Mine. With estimated total production of at least 150,000 ounces, the Hite Mine is ranked as the fifth largest historic
gold producing mine in Mariposa County. 

9 

The property includes
the following historic recognized gold mines: Hite, (6) Hite Central, (7) Kaderitas, (8) Mexican II, and Williams Brothers. In addition,
there are at least 50 additional mining portals which were, in the last 150 years, actively producing gold in unknown quantities. These
mines were actively producing with pick and shovel and pack-mule. No modern equipment or scientific means of geological study have ever
been employed. 

The company has a very
excellent working relation with the BLM, US Forest Service and National Park Service officials that will be involved in the project s
operation. 

It has secured a commitment from Mark Payne and Mr. Jon Grossman to become members of its on-site management team along with the same commitment. 

Mark Payne attended California State University Sacramento, Bachelor of Arts Geological Sciences Program and has been an independent geological consultant since 1985. He is a California Registered Professional Geologist #7067, and a member of the American Institute of Professional Geologists. He specializes in exploration, definition and resource estimation of gold-quartz vein systems and gold deposits dominated by coarse particulate gold and has served as chief geologist for several major companies such as Emgold Mining Corp and Sutter Gold Mining. 

Mr. Grossman received his BS in Economics from the Wharton School of Finance, University of Pennsylvania and has been involved in the precious metal and various aspects of the mining business for more than 30 years. At one time in his career, he was Director of Investment Banking on Wall Street and has been instrumental in founding and growing several businesses including Florida Bullion Traders, Inc. One of his major assets is the fact he was the General Manager of the mining operation that was owned by Mr. Geiger and that operated the mining project during its productive period and has a hands-on/on-site knowledge of the proper operating methods for this project.

There are seven
(7) portals. The method Troy used to stake its claims was to land-lock the area surrounding these claims in a way to prevent outside interests
to stake the additional original AT E claims. Since existing roads, trails, etc. may be expanded but no new ones constructed without
further government approval, this program proved effective. Troy s plan was at such time as it was ready to begin opening the various
portals for production to survey and stake the additional 290+ claims facilitated by its road and trail structure that provides access
to them. These additional claims together with the existing claims would provide Star with control over ~10,500 acres, 130 miles due East
of San Francisco Bay.

commsa
mining rights 

If the Company consummates
the Commsa Acquisition under the Share Purchase Agreement with Mr. Lemus, it will acquire 51 of Commsa, a Honduran Corporation, and as
a part of that acquisition the Company will acquire Commsa s mining rights to five mines that run near a stretch of the Rio Jalan
River and are in the process of being prepared for mining production. Below is the summary of Commsa Mining Rights. 

The environmental licenses
have been obtained and exploration is ongoing. Local small mining operations are producing a minimum of 250 to 300 oz of gold per site
per month while losing approximately 50 of the recoverable gold particles. We expect that our expanded operations, using modern equipment
and our new Genesis program, recently acquired, should result in up to a 98 rate of recoverable gold, leading to significantly higher
quantities of gold per site. 

Located two hours from
the capital city of Choluteca, Honduras, CONNSA owns the concession for unlimited exploitation, land and drill holes. The Potosi area
is rugged with elevations ranging from 300m to 1050m ASL. Saprolite and quartz - rich outcrop provide often treacherous footing on steep
hills. Outcrop is sparse with topographic highs being capped either by resistant quartz - veined andesites, Padre Miguel group rocks or
rhyolite intrusive doming. 

Hardy plants and trees
populate the regions proportional to altitude, soil, and water supply. Generally, the topographically higher elevations are covered with
pine forests and pine needle carpets. Lower regions, especially in stream and river drainages are covered in deciduous single canopy jungle. 

Choluteca, the fourth
largest city in Honduras, has a wide range of hotels and rental dwellings as well as good supply, repair, and communications infrastructure.
The city and the national capital, Tegucigalpa, are joined by 130km of the paved highway. The highway also provides access from Choluteca
to Clavos Road, one of many logging and agricultural roads throughout the area. Potosi is reached by driving 50km east on the highway
from Choluteca and taking the dirt road to Porteritos, a total of 1.5 hours driving time. The highway has both passenger and heavy transport
capabilities. 

Choluteca is serviced
by twelve daily bus runs. Daily international airline service is available to Tegucigalpa from every country while Choluteca is serviced
by an airstrip capable of landing 737 sized aircraft. 

A large, skilled labor
force with some mining experience, can be mobilized in most Honduran towns. The mining concessions are centered at 13 15 N
and 87 00 Win the area of Choluteca, Honduras. 

Mining and exploration
history 

At present, the Potosi
area is not being mined by other than small, high-grade operations consisting of one or two local individuals. They focus upon known occurrences
such as Tajo, San Antonio and, lately, San Benito with hand tools, cobbing and molinete techniques. The area has seen sporadic gold mining
activity since the time of the Spanish colonists 100 hundred years ago. Within the Potosi concession, Rosario Mining performed large scale
underground tunneling in the Guadaloupe, San Antonio, Guapinol, El Caballo and Tajo adits using tracked techniques of First World War
vintage. Brush-overgrown roads and at least several hundred meters of tunnels, most of them collapsed, are the legacy of this earlier
work. An unnamed American company did some small shafts and tunnels at Volcancito, and Jobos. No production records or plans are available. 

Geology Project 

Perhaps ten percent of
the Potosi area is rock outcrop. In a macro sense the outcrop available for mapping may be broken up into two Tertiary volcanic rock groups:
the Oligocene Matagalpa Formation (mainly andesitic in composition) and the Miocene Padre Miguel Group (mainly rhyolite / dacite). Matagalpa
Formation rocks contain andesite flows, crystal tuffs, feldspar porphyries, basalt, and finer grained volcano-sediments unconformably
overlain by the Padre Miguel rocks (rhyolitic to dacitic tuffs). Later stage rhyolite doming occurs in the San Antonio Mine area and immediately
east of the San Benito occurrence. The Cerro Potosi topographic high is probably correlative to the Padre Miguel group rooks. Later stage
mafic, intermediate, and felsic diking crosscut the main units. Padre Miguel rocks are invariably bleached white to pink to grey mass
of devitrified and silicified rhyolite to dacite, ignimbrite or silicified breccia. White, angular metamorphosed/altered clasts are diagnostic
of this occurrence at Pantaleon. Welding is observable in core. 

At Potosi, the rock types
are variations on the Matagalpa theme, except for Pantaleon, where the prime target was gold bearing epithermal quartz veining within
Padre Miguel rocks. It was also hoped that the contact between the Padre Miguel and Matagalpa rocks would be a logical horizon for gold
alteration zones. 

The majority of outcrop
mapped on the project is from the Matagalpa group: a flat-lying sequence of medium grained porphyritic tuff breccia of intermediate composition.
Markedly porphyritic flows were mapped on surface and logged in drill holes. The size and shape of the light grey/white feldspar phenocrysts
varies from millimeter to slightly less than 0,75 cm. More massive, non-porphyritic, fine-grained andesite was identified either as volcanic
flow or tuffs. The Matagalpa group is predominantly subaerial with limited sections of banded, lamellar tuffs which may have been subaqueous.
Pyroclastic andesite breccias are mapped and logged in all the focus zones. Heterolithic lapilli are common constituents of the lapilli
tuff. Heterolithic agglomeratic andesite and medium to coarse tuff breccia is logged in the San Benito drill holes. Fine grained intermediate
dykes which may be feeder dykes cut the same drill holes. 

47 

Felsic intrusive domes
are subaerial in nature. Flow banding and spherulites are common. The main target of the drilling at San Antonio and Tajo is epithermal
quartz veining and attendant alteration and silicification zones. 

Structure: The principal
trend mapped at San Antonio dips steeply to the north and is coincident with an east - west striking ridge. The trend is traceable on
surface from San Antonio through Corales / Guadaloupe where the strike becomes more northerly, increasing from generally east-west to
west-north-west (270 to 310/320). There are indications that the west-north-west striking Corales / Guadaloupe Mines exploit a second
structure mirroring the Nicaraguan trough. This trend disrupts the east-west trend hosting the San Antonio structure. 

Epithermal quartz veining
is evidently controlled by structurally prepared fault and fracture zones. These zones have provided the conduit for gold bearing siliceous
fluids driven by felsic doming as a heat engine . 

Alteration: Feldspar
and clay alteration is to moderate intense in the weathering horizon and adjacent to structurally affected areas and/or within the aura
of related, epithermally altered, siliceous zones. This alteration is in direct proportion to proximity of structural movement and quartz
veining. The near surface feldspar phenocrysts are soft, crumbly and subhedral to anhedral in form. Sausseritization is common in core. 

Hematization is ubiquitous
in surface rocks due to the weathering profile created by meteoric water circulation and subsequent oxidation. Faulted and fractured rocks
are also commonly hematized to varying extents. 

Silicification: All rock
units have silicified intersections (usually influenced by epithermal quartz veining) although pervasive silicification has been noted
on the metre scales in core and adjacent to quartz breccia zones during the mapping phase. Epidotization is part of a classic zonation
especially noticeable at San Benito where pervasive epidote gives way to pyritization and finally to silicification proximal to epithermal
quartz veining and associated chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite, silver minerals and gold. 

Sulphides / mineralization: There is a distinct
correlation between the presence of sulphide presence, type, and percentages to gold mineralization as noted in zone descriptions and
core logs. Sulphides are not consistent as to type or quantity between drilled zones. If indeed there is a gold pathfinder element at
Potosi, it is copper. Chalcopyrite, galena, pyrite, sphalerite, silver minerals (acanthite) and their oxide analogues are present in the
best mineralized intersections..

Below is a mineral resource
summary for the Clavos. The report is compiled from internationally validated exploration documentation that meets the standards set by
Canadian National Instrument 43-101, (NI 43-101) and National Instrument 43-101CP, and National Instrument 43-101F1. 

49 

Clavos 

1996 sampling traverses
by Entre Mares personnel (geologists Scoretz, Malfair, Cheng, Fraser and McCarthy at different times) indicated that anomalous gold was
present at Clavos zone in structurally and stratigraphically favorable terrain. Then by an independent group of Geologist from Guatemala
lead by Ruben Leal in 2005 and then again in 2020 further sampling from Clavos confirmed the ancient mineralized zones, as well as new
potential ones and complete economics and metallurgic reports. 

50 

The Choluteca concessions
encompass an area characterized by steep hills, rugged relief interspersed with rounded coast mountains and ridges and domes interspersed
with precipitous valleys. Cliffs are not uncommon particularly along zones of structural uplift or downthrow. 

Physiography and
Climate 

Clavos is steeper topographically
with rhyolite doming and very steep valleys throughout the property. 

Topography varies widely
from 60m on the west side to 1190m in the northeast corner of the properties. 

Honduras is subject to
temperatures ranging from the low 20's into the 40's (degrees Celsius) dependent upon the season. Climate is logically broken up into
extremes: the rainy season (June to October) and the dry season (November to May). 

Potosi 

Location and access 

The Potosi Project is
in the Municipality of Concepcion de Maria in southern Honduras, Department of Choluteca. 

Map 2855-IV (Concepcion
de Maria - Cinco Pinos, 1:50,000 topographic sheet) covers most of the property. The nearest center of commerce is Choluteca, the fourth
largest city in Honduras. 

Access to Potosi is best
achieved from the San Francisco turn-off on the Pan American Highway east of Choluteca. A 1.5-hour journey from Choluteca by 4x4 to the
village of Porteritos via highway and dirt road is the most efficient means of travel. 

Physiography 

The Potosi area is rugged
with elevations ranging from 300m to 1050m ASL. Saprolite and quartz - rich outcrop provide often treacherous footing on steep hills.
Outcrop is sparse with topographic highs being capped either by resistant quartz - veined andesites, Padre Miguel group rocks or rhyolite
intrusive doming. 

Hardy plants and trees
populate the regions proportional to altitude, soil, and water supply. Generally, the topographically higher elevations are covered with
pine forests and pine needle carpets. Lower regions, especially in stream and river drainages are covered in deciduous single canopy jungle.

dykes which may be feeder dykes cut the same drill holes. 

The main target of the
drilling at San Antonio and Tajo is epithermal quartz veining and attendant alteration and silicification zones. 

Drilling at the Tajo showing delineated a
quartz vein structure striking WNW and dipping moderately to the northeast. Diamond drill holes PT97-05 to PT97-11 intersected the structure
along a strike length of 150m over a 125m down dip extension. 

The Tajo Showing is located
on a variably dipping (15-30o) north-east facing slope. The Tajo structure was approached through a series of short drill holes. The structure
was pierced repeatedly at anticipated depths based on a 295o strike and -35o N dip; except in PT97-11 where the vein was intercepted 20m
higher in the hole. This may be explained by a swing in the strike to the northwest or an offset through faulting. Field evidence indicates
that the structure begins to strike 315o on the western end of the grid. The best assay was in PT97-7 (2.29g/T over 8.0m including a core
zone of 12.2g/T over 1.4m). it is geometrically demonstrable that the core zone corresponds to the base metal rich sulfide intervals of
the Tajo vein. 

San Antonio 

The San Antonio zone
was the first structure mapped and drilled during the program. The surface mapping showed altered porphyritic and a site overlying a more
massive unit of andesite tuff / lapilli tuff. 1:1000 scale surface mapping and diligent sampling of all promising areas was performed
on and off the grid. The underground mapping indicated that the San Antonio Mine topographically overlaps the Todos Santos Mine in Rosario
Mining's earlier attempt to mine the San Antonio structure. 

From 2004 to 2005 12
new drills were performed by Ruben Leal at San Antonio to prove gold reserves and extend the anomalous underground samples and DDH 94-5
mineralization. 

52 

San Benito 

An approximately 700
x 350m zone has been sampled with highly anomalous Au values obtained. It is open to both east and west and appears to represent stacked
epithermal quartz zones with Au, Ag and Cu mineralization. Another hole to the west of the Vespa Pit, possibly drilling under the chimney
zone would be useful in extending mineralization; a hole should be drilled to test the eastward extension of the chalcopyrite-bearing
quartz veins mapped there. Surface samples in pits and trenches returned more than 10g/T Au values. A program of at least five, 100m drill
holes would be necessary to properly test the very wide and persistent zone of base metal and gold enhancement within silicification and
quartz veining identified on the grid. 

Cerro Copal 

Lithology of Cerro Copal
is the same as Tajo. 

From 1999 to this day
this area is also being mined on a small scale by locals following high gold grades. Ending with complex underground structure that allows
us to create a 3D without drilling. 

This new exploration
area follows the Limon s trend from Nicaragua Gold belt. 

Lion Works, Inc.-Genesis Ore Extraction
Process 

On March 19, 2023, the
Company, as Buyer entered into that certain share purchase agreement with J. Lemus, as Seller which contemplated acquisition of 51 of
the capital stock of Lion Works, including 51 of the intellectual property rights and know-how related to the Genesis proprietary system Genesis ). This green, environmentally friendly, process, extracts up to 98 of the minerals, including gold and many rare
earth elements from Oxide and complex Ores. Furthermore, the process takes 12 - 48 hours which is considerably shorter than the 40 to
120 days other leaching processes take. Furthermore, the heap leaching process, as a general rule only extracts up to 70 of the gold
or other minerals from the ore. If left for one to two years it is possible to extract up to 90 of the minerals from the ore using heap
leaching methods and compared to CIL plant processing has the same effectiveness without the cost. CIL stands for carbon in leach. This
is a gold extraction process called cyanidation where carbon is added to the leach tanks or reaction vessels so that leaching and absorption
take place in the same tanks. It is the most commonly used leaching process for the extraction of gold. This process has a higher capital
and operating cost but generally has an improved gold recovery of between 20 and 30 . However, this process is still more expensive than
our Genesis system, is environmentally unfriendly, is still slow compared to Genesis and in the first 4 to 6 months extracts much less
ore than our Genesis system achieves over 12 to 48 hours. 

Genesis is the key process
that makes economically unviable deposits around the world viable and profitable again. 

Genesis is a sustainable
extraction method, that yields an improved recovery rate in a much shorter time period even where the presence of gold is as little as
0.10 parts per million. There are no emissions, and the system is environmentally friendly. 

Upon the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which Lion Works will become the Company s majority-owned
subsidiary (the Lion Works Acquisition), the Company intends to have independent geologists and engineers review the two different systems
and write reports on the process. This will be another use of the funds raised though the S-1 registration and funding process. 

53 

The Genesis Oxide System 

The Genesis system accelerates
the rate of dissolution of gold to nearly an immediate rate, therefore reducing the standard time of extraction from approximately 40-120
days to a few hours Consequently, the costs of production are dramatically reduced. The system is scalable and the smaller units are modular
and can easily be transported from location to location. 

Beyond the economic advantages
it also provides immediate technical solutions to difficulties caused by fine materials and resolves the need to agglomerate. The speed
of extraction of gold is up to 400 times faster than conventional heap leaching. 

Versatility 

At the heart of the Genesis
system is a reactor module that makes the system versatile in its relationship with installation, construction, and repositioning. The
system s conception, design, and its structural development is the innovative solution to older methods of extraction. In addition
to the numerous international collaborations it has resulted in the creation and implementation of Genesis for the provision of a practical
and economical solution that is effective, feasible, and reliable; characteristics which the mining industry has always required. 

The area needed to operate a complete module is merely 2,500 square meters which includes the absorption plant, a convenient reduction
in space requirements as compared to Heap leaching. 

The Genesis Refractory System 

The Genesis Refractory
system works on complex ores. This genesis system has a very significant transformation rate from double refractory lock gold into free
oxide gold. The system operates within a processing time of just a few hours, thereby reducing very significantly the time that a heap
leaching system would take. 

The Genesis system is
the only economically feasible solution for complex low-grade deposits and the only Cost-effective process to treat double refractory
gold and other minerals. 

This system like the
Genesis oxide system is an innovative solution that significantly improves the older methods. It is environmentally safe, has no emissions
and its speed of extraction is very cost effective. The true benefits are that it can be used on tailing piles, extracting in most instances
more minerals than was originally extracted with the older methods. It also cleans up these tailing piles during the extraction process
leaving smaller rocks and gravel that can be used on roads and rail tracks etc. The dirtiest of all tailings are coal tailings and our
equipment works very efficiently on these tailings extracting minerals and leaving useable rock residue. 

54 

Key Points: 

Lower capital investment needs in comparison to the standard processes available in the industry. 

System is much faster than regular heap leaching methods. 

Improved rate of extraction. 

Solution for low gold grade deposits. 

Solution for economically unviable deposits. 

Genesis has the same efficiency as a CIL plant without the costs. 

Reduced cost of production as compared with standard methods of extraction. 

Environmentally friendly process 

Modular structure system 

Easy to scale 

the smaller units are mobile, designed to be easily transported without any secondary costs 

Easy to adapt and displace in complicated terrains 

Option to substitute cyanide for a green chemical agent 

Lower cost of production per ounce 

The construction of processing plant from scratch would require under 6 months 

Capacity for complete automation 

Precise control and measurement of the recovery of the precious metals. 

Experience in managing conventional mining plants is not required for setting-up Genesis 

Eliminates all risk in setting-up production in under a non-explored gold-bearing zones 

Eliminates the need to grind the mineral ore 

Genesis is a closed system, eliminating the risk for spillages 

Considerably reduces the need for water, making it particularly viable for arid sites 

Water and chemical agents are all reutilized and recycled 

Machine has no emissions, making it very safe. 

The Genesis system also
solves the problem that mining companies may experience following the decision in 2022 of the U.S. Appellate Court for the 9th Circuit
known as the Rosemont decision. In that decision the Court rules that while federal mining law allows companies to mine on federal
land where economically valuable minerals are present, they are not guaranteed the right to use federal land without valuable minerals
as a dumping site for the mine. The Genesis system resolves any potential issues related to the mining waste/tailings, since it not only
extracts minerals from the tailings, but also cleans tailings leaving the residual as usable gravel for roads and railways. 

The cost effectiveness
of our Genesis eco-friendly system means that many closed and unprofitable mines can be operated again, due to the significant increase
in profitability with the lower cost of operation than conventional methods.

Our Growth Strategies 

The Company is planning
to reopen the mining properties it acquired from Troy in 2024. to to complete the Commsa Acquisition and the Lion Works Acquisition, and
to purchase the equipment necessary to start operations in Honduras and West Africa and actualize commercial production from the mines.
We believe that these activities will generate revenues and profit. The Company is also exploring
the acquisitions of assets and majority interests in companies with proprietary software related to artificial intelligence technology
and in the fintech arena. To implement this business plan, it will require the full utilization of our management, financial and
other resources and raising the funds necessary for the businesses. Our ability to manage growth effectively will depend on our ability
to quickly scale-up operations and to recruit, train and manage operations, management, and technical personnel and to retain the current
successful management team and adding experienced personnel to the team to enable us to meet our production expansion plan. 

57 

Competition 

The mining business is
highly competitive. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have. As a result, we may experience difficulty competing
with other businesses when conducting development and mining activities. In addition, marketing our new technology will take time to gain
traction in the mining industry. Numerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of gold recovered from our mining properties.
These factors include market fluctuations, the proximity and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment, government
regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and
environmental protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may result
our not receiving an adequate return on invested capital. If we purchase assets and/or majority
interests in companies in the fintech arena, it would be even more difficult to compete with other companies that have developed their
business in this highly competitive area and have greater financial resources than we have. 

Intellectual Property 

We currently do not have
any patents or trademarks registered in the name of the Company. Upon the acquisition of 51 interest in Lion Works, we will acquire 51 
in the proprietary technology owned by Lion Works, called Genesis, however this technology has not been patented, and the
Company will need to engage a patent attorney to apply for the patent registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Currently, the Company uses a combination of copyright, non-registered trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures
and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect its intellectual property rights to technologies that the Company may acquire or
develop. 

Compliance with
U.S. Government Regulation. 

The General Mining Law
of May 10, 1872, as amended (30 U.S.C. 22-54 and 611-615) is the major U.S. federal law governing locatable
minerals. This law allows citizens of the United States the opportunity to explore for, discover, and purchase certain valuable mineral
deposits on those federal lands that are open to mineral entry. The law sets general standards and guidelines for claiming the possessory
right to a valuable mineral deposit discovered during exploration. The General Mining Law allows for the enactment of state laws governing
location and recording of mining claims and sites that are consistent with federal law. The federal regulations implementing the General
Mining Law are found at Title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in Groups 3700 and 3800. 

A mining claim is a selected
parcel of U.S. federal land, valuable for a specific mineral deposit or deposits, for which the claimant has asserted a right of possession
under the General Mining Law. All rights to the Star Alliance International Corp. Claims are restricted to the exploration and extraction
of a mineral deposit. The rights granted by a mining claim protect against a challenge by the United States and other claimants only after
the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit. The two types of mining claims are lode and placer. The Star Alliance International Corp.
Claims are lode claims. Lode claims cover classic veins or lodes having well-defined boundaries and also include other rock in-place bearing
valuable mineral deposits. Lode claims are usually located as parallelograms with the side lines parallel to the vein or lode. The end
lines of the lode claim must be parallel to qualify for underground extralateral rights. Extralateral rights involve the rights to minerals
in vein or lode form that extend at depth outside the vertical boundaries of the claim. The Star Alliance International Corp. Claims are
a mixture of patented and unpatented mining claims. A patented mining claim is one for which the federal government has conveyed title,
making it private land. Since October 1, 1994, the BLM has been prohibited by acts of Congress from accepting any new mineral patent applications. 

Generally, all claimants
must pay an annual maintenance fee per claim or site to the BLM, or file for a waiver from payment of fees by September 1 of each year.
Failure to file for a waiver or pay the fee by September 1 results in the claim or site becoming forfeited by operation of law. Assessment
work is work or labor performed that develops the claim for production (43 CFR Part 3836). Geological, geophysical, and geochemical surveys
may qualify as assessment work for a limited period. Use of these surveys requires the filing of a detailed report, including basic findings. 

58 

State laws also require
the annual filing of an affidavit of assessment work with the proper county if the work is performed. The filing of an affidavit of annual
assessment work with both the local county office and the proper BLM State Office is required if the claimant elects to file a waiver
from payment of the maintenance fees. The affidavit or proof of labor must be filed no later than December 30 following the filing of
a waiver in the proper BLM State Office and in the county or borough recorder s office. 

The performance of assessment
work must be within a certain period referred to as the assessment year. The assessment year begins at noon of each September 1. It ends
at noon September 1 of the next year (43 CFR Part 3836). Performance of assessment work need not occur during the first assessment year
of location. 

Exploration and mining
activities on BLM-administered land are controlled by the regulations of the Secretary of the Interior contained in 43 CFR, Subparts 3715
and 3809. We are required by these regulations to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the land. For activities other than casual
use, we will be required to submit either a notice or a plan of operations. A plan of operations, which includes a reclamation plan, is
required where activities involve the surface disturbance of more than 5 acres. Notices also require the submission of a reclamation plan
and are submitted for exploration activities covering 5 acres or less. There is no requirement for notifying the BLM of casual use activities.
Casual use activities are those that cause only negligible disturbance of public lands and resources. For example, activities that do
not involve the use of earthmoving equipment or explosives may be considered casual use. 

We will be required to
reclaim any surface disturbing activity, even if the claim or site is declared abandoned and void or forfeited by the BLM. Reclamation
will be required if we relinquish the claim or site to the Federal Government. The BLM requires a reclamation bond or other financial
security prior to approving a plan of operations or allowing operations under a notice to proceed. Surface Management actions are processed
at the local level. 

We intend to submit a
plan of operations for our planned activities on the Star Alliance International Corp. Claims to the BLM district office. The plan of
operations must include appropriate environmental protection and reclamation measures and describe either the entire operation proposed
or reasonably foreseeable operations and how they would be conducted, including the nature and location of proposed structures and facilities. 

The public has the conditional
right to cross mining claims or sites for recreational and other purposes and to access federal lands beyond the claim boundaries. Although
claimants have a right of access to a mining claim or site across federal lands, they are not allowed to cause unnecessary or undue degradation
of the surface resources. Claimants may be liable for damages if found responsible for unnecessary loss of or injury to property of the
United States. We may not construct permanent structures, mobile structures, or store equipment without the prior approval of an authorized
federal official.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following
discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes
to those statements and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual
Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information
with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The various sections of this discussion contain forward-looking
statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout
this Annual Report as well as other matters over which we have no control. See Forward-Looking Statements. Our actual results
may differ materially. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
occurring after the date of this. 

Our cash balance was 4,391 as of June 30, 2023.
We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing
funds raised from the sale of shares and borrowed from our Chairman. The Chairman has no commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to
advance or loan funds to the company. The borrowing is non-interest-bearing, unsecured, and due on demand. 

Our independent registered public accountants
have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next
twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company continues as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of
liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has accumulated deficit of
 25,547,794 and working capital of (1,609,917) as of June 30, 2023, and a net loss of 10,489,394 most of which is a non cash expense.
The Company used 461,573 of cash in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2023. Due to these conditions, it raises substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

We are a smaller reporting company under Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company,
we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are
not emerging growth companies such as that we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; we can use reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and
proxy statements; we can use exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation
and nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

Results of Operations for the years ended
June 30, 2022 and 2021 

Operating expenses 

 General and administrative expenses were 978,792
for the year ended June 30, 2022, compared to 94,508 for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of 1,815,073. The increase is due
to an increase in filing fees and consulting expenses. 

Professional fees were 142,863 for the year ended
June 30, 2023, compared to 144,763 for the year ended June 30, 2022, a decrease of 1,900. Professional fees consist mainly of legal,
accounting and audit expense. The decrease is due to lower legal and accounting fees. 

There was a loss on conversion of common stock
for Directors compensation of 3,211,400 and officer compensation of 3,100,500 for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to 2,111,500
and 952,500 for the year ended June 30, 2022. 

Other income (expense) 

 For the year ended June 30, 2023, we had interest
expense of 308,823 and a net loss on conversion of debt of 166,799 compared to interest expense of 297,417 and loss on conversion of
debt of 102,403 for the year ended June 30, 2022. In addition, there was a loss on issuance of convertible debt of 0 in 2023 compared
to 575,396 in 2022. Interest expense has increased as a result of interest on notes payable that were added to the Company s liabilities
and the amortization of debt discount associated with our convertible notes. 

Net Loss 

 Net loss for the year ended June 30, 2023 was
 10,489,394 compared to 11,885,609 for the year ended June 30, 2022. 

Plan of Operations 

We expect that working capital requirements will
continue to be funded through borrowing from related parties and others. Subsequent to the year end June 30, 2022, the Company acquired
the mining claims and equipment assets of Troy Mining Corporation. We also acquired or entered into agreements to acquire other businesses
during the year ended June 30, 2023. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

64 

Material Commitments 

As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not
have any material commitments. 

Purchase of Significant Equipment 

We do intend to purchase any significant equipment
during the next twelve months subject to financing. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets,
and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has accumulated
deficit of 25,547,794 and negative working capital of (1,609,917) as of June 30, 2023, and a net loss of 10,489,394 most of which is
non cash expense. The Company used 461,573 of cash in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2023. Due to these conditions,
it raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Net cash used in operating activities was 491,573
for the year ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the net cash used in operating activities of 739,630 for the year ended June 30, 2022.
The reduction in net cash used in operating activities from 2023 to 2022 is because stock issued for services decreased during the year
ended June 30, 2023. 

Net cash provided by financing activities was
 394,240 and 1,004,565 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Over the next twelve months, we expect our principle
source of liquidity may be dependent on borrowings from related and other parties. 

Going Concern Consideration 

Our auditors have issued a going concern 
opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain
additional capital. The Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. 

Limited operating history and need for additional
capital 

There is no historical financial information about
us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any significant revenues.
We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of
a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services
and products.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Star Alliance International Corp. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Star Alliance International Corp. (the Company) as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively, and the related statement of operations,
stockholders deficit and cash flows for the period then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the period then ended in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to
those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 . 

 Going Concern Uncertainty 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has
incurred losses since inception of 25,547,794. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company had a net loss of 10,489,394. These
factors create an uncertainty as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to
these matters are also described in note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty.

as of June 30, 2023. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company had a net loss of , which
did include of non-cash expense incurred for the issuance of common stock for services, loss on conversion of preferred stock
and derivatives associated with convertible debt. We used of cash in operating activities. Due to these conditions, it raises
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company is attempting
to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support its
daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and
in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise
additional funds. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying
amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

of the share capital of Commsa, a newly-formed company, which has the mining rights to five operating mines that
run along a 12.5-mile stretch of the Rio Jalan River, in consideration for in cash and the issuance of shares of
the Company s common stock to Mr. Lemus (the Commsa Acquisition ). In addition, the Company has agreed to provide up
to in working capital to expand the mining operations in a gold mining project (Rio Jalan Project) in Olancho state in the
highlands of Central Honduras. The Company did not meet its obligations for the consummation of the Commsa Acquisition by March 31, 2022
as set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement; however, the parties did not terminate the Share Purchase Agreement, intending that the
Company would be able to obtain the necessary funding later and to consummate the Commsa Acquisition. No assets other than the cash paid
and value of shares issued have been included on the Balance Sheet 

On August 14, 2023, the Company and Juan Lemus
executed a first addendum to the Share Exchange Agreement which provided for the extension of the Company s obligations to pay 1,000,000
in cash, the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock to Mr. Lemus and the payment of 7,500,000 in working capital
until September 30, 2023. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company issued to Mr. Lemus only shares of Common Stock and
paid toward the required 1,000,000 cash payment. On September 28, 2023, the parties executed a second addendum that extended
the time of the Company s payments from September 30, 2023 to December 31, 2023. 

On March 19, 2023, the Company entered into and
executed a share purchase agreement (the Share Purchase Agreement with Lion Works Advertising, SA, a Guatemalan corporation Lion Works and Juan Lemus, the sole shareholder of Lion Works, which contemplated the acquisition by the Company, as Buyer,
from Mr. Lemus, as Seller, of of the capital stock of Lion Works, including of the intellectual property rights and know-how related
to the Genesis extraction system Genesis ). The Share Purchase Agreement superseded the terms of the binding Letter of Intent

on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 

None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

Management s Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as of June 30, 2022, the end of the year covered by this report, our management concluded its evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. 

Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls
and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing
possible controls and procedures. 

Our management does not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can
be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

With respect to the fiscal year ending June 30,
2022, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon our evaluation regarding the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective.

Management s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act. Our management is also required to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance
with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Section 404 ). Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded
that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms. We note the following deficiencies that management believes to be material weaknesses: 

The Company s lack of segregation of duties. 

Lack of an audit committee and independent directors 

Management has not established appropriate and rigorous procedures for evaluating internal controls over financial reporting. Due to limited resources and lack of segregation of duties, documentation of the limited control structure has not been accomplished. 

We employ policies and procedures for reconciliation of the financial statements and note disclosures, however, these processes are not appropriately documented. 

Management has not established methodical and consistent data back-up procedures to ensure loss of data will not occur. 

The Company is evaluating the necessity of implementing
an independent board of directors to rectify these weaknesses. 

A material weakness (within the meaning of PCAOB
Auditing Standard No. 5) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting
that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company s
financial reporting. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies and procedures may deteriorate. 

This annual report does not include an attestation
report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not
subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes in Internal Controls 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the year ended June 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Item 9B. Other Information 

We have no other information to disclose that
was required to be disclosed in a report on Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 that was not reported.
