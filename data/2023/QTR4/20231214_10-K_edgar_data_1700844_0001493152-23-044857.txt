Our
Future Strategies 

We
intend to pursue the following strategies to further develop and expand our business: 

Continued
 investment in research and development in hybrid air-conditioning products 

The
Group intends to continue development of its hybrid air-conditioning products to further increase its product offerings, as well as
to expand its client base, especially with commercial and industrial clients. The Group plans to expand its distribution into other
South East Asia markets, China and Asia markets, which has high potential demand for air-conditioning as their population gross
domestic product GDP increases. Taking advantage of the global awareness and push to reduce harmful factors leading
to global warming, the Group continues to market its EvoAir TM brand and e-Cond Evo TM as eco-friendly products
aiming to reduce emission of waste heat from the air-conditioner condensing units and at the same time improving energy efficiency.
The Group aims to continue its innovation through investment into research and development, to further improve on its product lines,
reduce its carbon emissions as it strives to become a leader in HVAC green inventions. 

Continued
 production of air purifier and air-sanitizing systems 

The
 Group continues to improve on its production of air purifier and air-sanitizing systems in order to capitalize on increased market
 demand for air sanitizing products in the wake of the global coronavirus pandemic. The Group is expanding usage and application of
 its INCU Technology, which acts as an effective disinfectant solution into more sectors and markets as the Group foresees growth
 in demand for air-sanitizing products as a must-have product in general consumer households in the near future. Besides household
 consumers, the Group also aims to expand its commercial and industrial customer base, as well as partake in public sanitation projects.
 In terms of sanitation products, the company aims to expand into personal healthcare products such as formulated toiletries cleansers
 incorporating the INCU ionic nano copper solution as an active ingredient. 

Geographical
 expansion 

A
 key component of our strategy is to enter into and expand into new markets with high demand for HVAC. The Group intends to replicate
 the similar model, continue development of its product line and expand into other Southeast Asian countries and the Chinese market,
 with possible expansion into the Middle East, Indonesia and India in the future. 

Promoting
 importance of environmental-friendly technology 

The
 Group also advocates the importance of promoting environmentally friendly technology and creating awareness to the public to play
 a part in protecting the environment as well as creating synergy with the Group s products and brand image. 
 
 On
 5 May 2023, the Company launched Cool the Earth Day which marks the birth of the environmental movement for HVAC industry.
 It was a movement launched by EvoAir Group advocating that (i) everyone can enhance his/her lifestyle through green inventions while
 preserving the Earth; and (ii) everyone can be the Ambassador of the Earth - everyone can do a part, be it in the smallest
 way in protecting our environment. Cool the Earth Day is a movement in line with the Company s mission to contribute
 to the Earth and society amidst the alarming global warming and climate change issues confronting the world and its 8 billion population
 through green inventions and creating awareness. We hope that through this movement, people will raise their awareness that everyone
 can do a part, be it in the smallest way in protecting our environment. At EvoAir, every member is an Ambassador of the Earth, sharing
 the same mission of protecting the Earth. The Company believes that everyone around the globe can be an Ambassador of the Earth. 
 
 In
 2023, the Group collaborated with a university in Malaysia to study the effect of heat generated by outdoor condensing unit of
 traditional air-conditioning system towards surrounding environment, by studying the effects of air conditioning system on plant
 growth in a green-house setting. The study concludes that air produced by EvoAir TM outdoor condensing unit, Coolpressor,
 is lower in temperature and is more environmental friendly and favourable for the growth of green planted compared to hot air
 produced by conventional air-conditioner outdoor condensing unit. This positive outcome will surely path a new and sustainable

EVO TM 

With
the objective of embracing well-being of mankind through green living and preserving the Earth through green inventions e-Cond
EVO TM is a breakthrough invention building on the research and development R D of Dr Low Wai Koon Dr. Low ), our Director, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and his team, it is the Group s first invented its
line of eco-friendly portable air-conditioners under its e-Cond EVO TM brand in 2017. 

The
unit is an eco-friendly air-conditioning system with patent pending heat emission control system HECS technology, which regulates the temperature and volume of heat
transferred from the air-conditioning system into the environment. This product employs an innovative hydro-refrigeration system HRS integrating evaporative cooling process with refrigeration cycle, reducing temperature of the output air by approximately 30 while achieving
an optimal cooling performance of approximately 25 to 28 degree Celsius. The patent pending technology in the unit allows it to utilize
substantially lower energy than its traditional air-conditioning units. The portable air-conditioning systems also incorporate ionizer
technology producing high concentrations of negative ions to purify the surrounding air of mold spores, pollen, pet dander, odors, cigarette
smoke, bacteria, viruses, dust and other hazardous airborne particles. 

The
Company markets two models of the e-Cond EVO TM units: the Super King and the Outdoor King. 

EvoAir TM 

The
Group continued to research on incorporating its patent pending HECS Technology as well as various other patent pending technologies
into its product line, subsequently launching its EvoAir TM hybrid air-conditioners in 2021. 

The
Group s core product, EvoAir TM , is a first-of-its-kind eco-friendly air-conditioner with granted patent or utility model/
patent or utility model pending heat emission control system HECS proprietary technology, which turns waste heat released
by conventional air-conditioner condenser (external unit) into cool and moisturised air at approximately 26 o C to 32 o C
with a humidity of 60 , operating under outdoor condition, which is optimal for human and living things. The re-engineering of
the air-conditioning system has transformed the air-conditioner condenser (external unit) into a supplementary cooling unit or Coolpressor ,
which also functions as an air cooler. It also reduces energy consumption of at least 20 compared to conventional air-conditioning units.
The significant decrease in waste heat and reduction in energy consumption play an important role in reducing harmful effects to the
environment, in line with the Group s mission of producing eco-friendly invention in protecting the Earth.

Air-conditioning
refrigerant is harmful to the environment. The EvoAir TM system utilizes the R32 refrigerant in its operation, which is 9 
lower in density than the traditionally used R410A refrigerant found in various conventional air-conditioning systems, while maintaining
approximately 43-50 higher latent heat vaporization and approximately 41 higher thermal conductivity when combined with the Group s
other patent-pending technologies. EvoAir TM s system design also allows for a further reduction in refrigerant use of
at least 30 compared to conventional air-conditioning systems with traditional long copper coils by increasing the efficiency of the
heat transfer in the R32 refrigerant, in doing so, further increasing refrigerant efficiency.

The
Air Conditioner Industry 

Growing
demand for cooling 

According
to International Energy Agency IEA (https://www.iea.org/energy-system/buildings/space-cooling#tracking), there are currently
about 2 billion air conditioning units operating worldwide, and by 2050, it is predicted that there will be 5.6 billion units. According
to the statistics report published by the Japan Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Industry Association JRAIA (https://www.jraia.or.jp)
in July 2022, the world s total air conditioner demand in 2021 is estimated at 110 million, which represent 102 of the world demand
in 2020. Looking at the 2021 world demand in terms of Japan, China and other regions, the largest demand is from China, of which demand
is estimated to have reached 41.305 million, representing 98 of 2020 s demand. China s demand accounts for 38 of the total
global demand. Next to China, the Asian region (excluding Japan and China) stands at approximately 17.983 million, followed by North
America with 16.515 million, Japan with 10.201 million, Europe with 8.885 million and Latin America with 6.547 million. 

Air-conditioners
vary in energy efficiency and their usage lead to a global consumption of approximately 2,000 terawatt hours of electricity annually.
In addition, almost 20 of all the electricity used in buildings is for cooling, accounting for 14 of average peak residential electricity
demand globally. 

The
emerging economies are expected to use more air-conditioners as income levels rise. Of the 2.8 billion people living in the hottest parts
of the world, only 8 currently own air-conditioning units compared to approximately 90 ownership in the United States and Japan. By
2050, India, China and Indonesia may account for 50 of the projected growth in energy use for space cooling.

Global
Emissions from the use of Air Conditioners 

The
efficiency of air conditioners vary widely, in all major markets today, consumers are typically buying air conditioners whose average
efficiencies are less than half of what is available. Carbon dioxide emissions from cooling systems have tripled since 1990 to 1,130
million tons in 2016, and local air pollutants caused by cooling systems have also increased. Greenhouse Gases produced include Carbon
Dioxide and Climate Change: 

Carbon
 dioxide is called a greenhouse gas because it absorbs infrared energy and remits this energy back in all directions. About half of
 that energy goes out into space and about half of it returns to Earth as heat, contributing to the greenhouse effect and climate
 change 

The
 four main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases. Carbon dioxide accounts for about 75 
 of global greenhouse gas emissions. 

About
 30 of greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation, 25 come from the production of electricity, 23 comes from industrial
 production, 12 comes from commercial and residential sources and 10 comes from agriculture. 

Climate
 change could increase the occurrence and severity of weather events, such as heat waves, droughts and floods. These changes are likely
 to increase losses to property and crops and affect economic activity. 

The
 usage of air conditioners has a significant impact on the environment. Air-conditioners use chemical refrigerants, usually hydrofluorocarbons
 in their heat exchange systems. The hydrofluorocarbons contributes significantly to global warming if leaked to the atmosphere. 

The
 generation of the electricity to power the air conditioners also contribute to significant emissions, especially when fossil fuels
 are burnt to produce electricity. 

Urbanized
areas have higher temperatures than less urbanized areas, contributing to heat islands. This is because urban areas usually have less
greenery. Roads and buildings absorb and re-emit daytime heat more than forests and water bodies. As a result, urban daytime temperatures
can reach approximately 1 to 7 degrees higher in Fahrenheit than the outlying areas and night-time temperatures can reach approximately
2 to 5 degrees higher in Fahrenheit. The use of air conditioners extract hot air to the outside of buildings. On high temperature days,
the hot air emitted by air-conditioner units increases the outdoor temperature. This in turn increases the need for more cooling and
creates a feedback loop. The use of air conditioners can increase outdoor urban temperatures by more than approximately 1 degree Celsius
in some cities 

Global
Efforts to combat Climate Change and Global Warming 

If
the current rate of growth of energy use by air conditioners continues, the U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA predicts that by 2050, global energy usage for space cooling would triple to 6,200 terra watts. This would triple the amount of carbon
dioxide emissions and heavy investments in electricity infrastructure to meet peak electricity demand. This could cause severe financial
strain on emerging economies. 

Over
the years, countries around the world have come together to support policies to combat climate change. However, obtaining consensus has
been challenging because of political and national circumstances. The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which entered into force
on 1 January 2019, help protect the climate by phasing down high global warming potential hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are commonly
used as refrigerants. Promoting the energy efficiency of cooling technology can also significantly increase climate benefits. 

From
 October 31 to November 12, 2021, the 26th annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) was held in Glasgow, Scotland. The objectives
 of COP26 were: 

i.
Countries were called out to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to cap the increase in global temperatures below 1.5 C from
current levels; 

ii.
To protect and restore ecosystems and habitats and build resilient infrastructures to withstand climate change; 

iii.
Developed nations to mobilize 100bn in climate finance per year for poorer nations; and 

iv.
Parties of COP26 to finalize the agreement and rules for action and monitoring. 

The
Role of Air conditioners Efficiency in combating Climate Change 

Intuitively,
the more energy efficient air-conditioners are, the less electricity they would consume, and less fossil fuels would be burnt to produce
electricity. This would lead to less carbon dioxide emissions which could reduce global warming. 

The
EIA highlighted one area where policy action could deliver substantial energy savings quickly by making air conditioners equipment
more efficient. Through stricter minimum energy performance standards and other measure such as labelling, the average energy efficiency
of the stock of air conditioners globally could more than double in efficiency between now and 2050. This could reduce cooling-related
energy demand to 3,400 terawatts in 2050 compared to 6,200 terawatts if efficiency remained at current levels. The 45 reduction in energy
usage or 2,800 terawatts could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 1,582 megatons annually. This scenario was called the Efficient Cooling
Scenario by EIA. 

12 | Page 

In
addition, the use of less electricity because of more efficient air conditioners greatly reduces the need to build new generation capacity
to meet peak electricity demand. In the Efficient Cooling Scenario, there would not be a need to build additional capacity deliver the
1,300 gigawatts of power with more efficient air conditioners. This is equivalent to all the coal-fired power generation in China and
India today. In addition, the cumulative infrastructure, fuel and operating costs savings amounted to 2.9 trillion from 2017 to 2050.
This means 45 lower electricity costs for everyone as well, compared to if there were no efficiency improvements in air conditioners

 RISK
 FACTORS 

Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry 

If
we are unable to continue to innovate, meet evolving market trends, adapt to changing customer demands and maintain our culture of innovation,
our ability to sustain and grow our business may suffer. 

The
ongoing success of our business depends on our ability to continue to introduce innovative eco-friendly HVAC products to meet evolving
market trends and satisfy changing customer demands. We must continue to adapt by innovating, improving our products and modifying our
strategies, which could cause us to incur substantial costs. We may not be able to continue to innovate or adapt to changing market and
customer needs in a timely and cost-effective manner, if at all. This could adversely impact our ability to expand our ecosystem and
grow our business. Failure to develop new products to meet evolving market demands through innovation could cause us to lose current
and potential customers and harm our operating results and financial condition. 

In
addition, we may not be able to maintain our culture of innovation, which has been critical to our success and has helped us create value
for our shareholders, succeed as a leader in eco-friendly HVAC products, attract, retain and motivate employees and other ecosystem participants.
Among other challenges, we may not be able to identify and promote people into leadership positions who share our culture and also focus
on technology and innovation. Competitive pressure may also cause us to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision
and values. If we cannot maintain our culture of innovation, our long-term business prospects could be materially and adversely affected.

We
are exposed to concentration risk of heavy reliance on our largest nano copper supplier for the supply of nano copper solution for our
INCU technology, and any shortage of, or delay in, the supply may significantly impact on our business and results of operation. 

We
source INCU nano copper solution for incorporation of our INCU technology into our air purifier products for sale to our customers
from our largest nano copper supplier. As such, we rely on the ability and efficiency of our largest supplier to supply products.
Our purchase from our largest nano copper supplier amounted to approximately Nil and 315,627 for FYE2023 and FYE 2022,
respectively, representing approximately 37 and 30 of our total purchases, respectively. Our purchases from our top largest
supplier accounted for a significant portion of our total purchases for FYE2022 and FYE2021. 

As
we do not engage in manufacturing of nano copper solution, our business, financial condition and operating results for our air purifier
system depends on the continuous supply of nano copper solution from our largest supplier and our continuous supplier-customer relationship
with them. Our heavy reliance on our largest supplier for the supply of nano copper solution will have significant impact on our air
purifier business and results of operation in the event of any shortage of, or delay in the supply. Our product supply may also be disrupted
by potential labor disputes, strike action or natural disasters or other accidents affecting our largest supplier. If our largest suppliers
do not supply products to us in a timely manner or in sufficient quantities, our business, financial condition and operating results
may be materially and adversely affected. Any shortage of, disruption, or delay in the supply, or our inability to obtain supplies from
alternative sources will have a significant impact on our business and results of operation. 

We
entered into distribution agreement with our nano copper solution supplier in September, 2020 and December 2021. As is customary in the
supply or sales arrangements, the agreements with our largest supplier are terminable by either party by giving notice. We cannot guarantee
that our largest suppliers will not terminate the agreements before the expiry of the agreements. In the event that our largest suppliers
terminate the agreements, we will have to source products from other suppliers and we may not be able to secure a similar supply of products
with the quantity and quality required to support our business or at all. Such termination may therefore have a material adverse impact
on our business, financial condition and operating results if we fail to engage any other suppliers with similar standards before the
termination.

is no assurance that our major nano copper supplier and supplier of raw materials for our other products will continue to supply their
products in the quantities and timeframes required by us to meet the demand of our customers or comply with their supply agreements with
us. If our major supplier does not supply products to us in a timely manner or in sufficient quantities, our business, financial condition
and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, in the event of any delay in delivery of the products to
us, our cash flow or working capital may be materially and adversely affected as a result of the corresponding delay in delivery of our
products to our customers, and hence the delay in our receipt of payment from our customers. 

Furthermore,
our largest nano copper supplier may change their existing sales or marketing strategy in respect of the products supplied to us by changing
its export strategy, reducing its sales or production volume or changing its selling prices. As a result, there is no assurance that
our largest supplier will not appoint other agents, dealers or distributors which may compete with us in the market where we operate.
Furthermore, any significant increase in the selling prices of the products which we source from our largest suppliers will increase
our costs and may materially and adversely affect our profit margin if we are not able to pass the increased costs on to our customers. 

There
is no assurance that there will be no deterioration in our relationship with our largest supplier which could affect our ability to secure
sufficient supply of products for our business. In the event that our largest supplier change their sales or marketing strategy or otherwise
appoints other dealers or distributors who may compete with us, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially
and adversely affected. 

We
operate in a competitive industry, and if we fail to compete effectively, our business could suffer. 

The
air-conditioning and air purifying industry in Asia is highly competitive. Competition in our HVAC products includes several multinational,
regional and local companies, the largest players of which include Daikin Industries, Gree Electric, Trane Technologies, Johnson
Controls, Lennox International, Midea Group and Mitsubishi Electric. Sales depend on price, product availability, delivery schedule,
product performance, product line breadth, brand reputation, design, technical expertise and service. In addition to established players,
we face competition from new market entrants. Increased competition may lead to a loss of market share, increased difficulty in launching
new service offerings, reduction in revenue or increase in loss, any one of which could harm our business, financial condition and results
of operations. 

In
certain of our businesses, our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. Our bids are based upon, among other factors,
the cost to timely provide the products and services. To generate an acceptable return, we must accurately estimate our costs and schedule.
If we fail to do so, the profitability of contracts may be materially and adversely affected including because some of our contracts
provide for liquidated damages if we do not perform on time which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position,
results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

If
we are unable to create brand influence, we may not be able to maintain current or attract new users and customers for our products. 

Our
operational and financial performance is highly dependent on the strength of our brand. We believe brand familiarity and preference will
continue to have a significant role in winning over customers. In order to further expand our customer base, we may need to substantially
increase our marketing expenditures to enhance brand awareness through various online and offline means. Moreover, negative coverage
in the media of our company could threaten the perception of our brand, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to defuse negative
press coverage about our company to the satisfaction of our investors, customers and suppliers. If we are unable to defuse negative press
coverage about our company, our brand may suffer in the marketplace, our operational and financial performance may be negatively impacted. 

Currently,
we sell our products, under our various product line brands, to domestic customers in Malaysia and to overseas customers. However, while
the management does not consider the likelihood to be high, if our competitors initiate a lawsuit against us for infringing their trademarks,
we may be forced to adopt a new brand name for our products. As a result, we may incur additional marketing cost to raise awareness of
such new brand name. We may also be ordered to pay a significant amount of damages, and our business, results of operations and financial
condition could be materially and adversely affected. We operate in a competitive environment and our profitability and competitive position
depend on our ability to accurately estimate the costs and timing of providing our products and services. 

Climate
change and regulations associated with climate change could adversely affect our business. 

The
effects of climate change, including extreme weather conditions, create financial risks to our business. The effects of climate change
could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials and by increasing insurance and other operating costs.
The effects of climate change also may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in the areas
most prone to physical risks, which could similarly increase our operating and material costs. We could also face indirect financial
risks passed through the supply chain that could result in higher prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them. 

There
is a general consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are linked to climate change, and that these emissions must be reduced dramatically
to avert its worst effects. As a result, increased public awareness and concern about climate change will likely continue to (1) generate
more international, regional and/or national concerns and result in the implementation of further requirements and restrictions at international,
regional and/or national level to curtail the use of high global warming potential refrigerants (which are essential to many of our products);
(2) encourage increase in building energy efficiency; and (3) cause a shift away from the use of fossil fuels as an energy source. While
our products are focused on being eco-friendly, these requirements may render some of the existing technology, particularly some of our
products that require refrigerant use, non-compliant or obsolete. While we continue to be committed to developing eco-friendly sustainable
solutions for our products, there can be no assurance that our development efforts will be successful, that our products will be accepted
by the market, that proposed regulations or deregulation will not have an adverse effect on our competitive position, or that economic
returns will reflect our investments in new product development. 

The
inconsistent international, regional and/or national requirements associated with climate change regulations also create economic and
regulatory uncertainty. There is also regulatory and budgetary uncertainty associated with government incentives, which, if discontinued,
could adversely impact the demand for energy-efficient buildings and could increase costs of compliance. 

Our
business and financial performance depend on continued and substantial investments in our information technology infrastructure, which
may not yield anticipated benefits and which may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. 

The
efficient operation of our business requires continued and substantial investments in information technology IT infrastructure
systems. The failure to design, develop and implement new IT technology infrastructure systems in an effective and timely manner or to
maintain existing systems could divert management s attention and resources. Our information systems may also become obsolete because
of inadequate investments, requiring an unplanned transition to a new platform that could be time consuming, costly, and damaging to
our competitive position and could require additional management attention. Repeated or prolonged interruptions of service because of
poor execution, inadequate investments or obsolescence could have a significant adverse impact on our reputation and our ability to sell
products and services. 

20 | Page 

In
addition, our business may be impacted by disruptions to our or third-party IT infrastructure, which could result from (among other causes)
cyber-attacks, infrastructure failures or compromises to our physical security. Cyber-based risks are evolving and include attacks: (i)
on our IT infrastructure (ii) targeting the security, integrity and/or availability of hardware and software; (iii) on information installed,
stored or transmitted in our products (including after the purchase of those products and when they are installed into third-party products);
and (iv) on facilities or similar infrastructure. Such attacks could disrupt our systems (or those of third parties) and business operations,
impact the ability of our products to work as intended or result in the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction
of information in violation of applicable law and/or contractual obligations. We have experienced cyber-based attacks and, due to the
evolving threat landscape, may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency or severity. We continue to
make investments and adopt measures to enhance our protection, detection, response and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential
risks to our technology, products, services, operations and confidential data. However, depending on the nature, sophistication and scope
of cyber-attacks, it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period. As a result, we could potentially
experience: (i) production downtimes; (ii) operational delays or other detrimental impacts on our operations; (iii) destruction or corruption
of data; (iv) security breaches; (v) manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks or products; and (vi) financial
losses from remedial actions, loss of business, liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to our reputation any of which could
have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Due to the evolving
nature of such risks, the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted. In addition, because of the global nature of our business,
our internal systems and products must comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards in a number of jurisdictions, and government
enforcement actions and violations of data privacy and cybersecurity laws could be costly or interrupt our business operations. Any disruption
to our business arising from such issues, or an increase in our costs to cover these issues that is greater than what we have anticipated,
could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

We
depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers.
Infringement of or the failure to protect that intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success. 

The
Company s intellectual property rights are important to our business and include numerous patents, trademarks, proprietary technology,
technical data, business processes and other confidential information. Although we consider our intellectual property rights in the aggregate
to be valuable, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them.
We nonetheless rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, nondisclosure agreements, customer and supplier agreements, license agreements,
information technology security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property.
We also rely on nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and
supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. Our efforts to protect such
intellectual property and proprietary information may not be sufficient, however. 

We
cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us
in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will found to be valid or sufficiently
broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. 

In
addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third-party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or
seeking to prevent the sale and marketing of certain of our products. Our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations
on our ability to obtain possession, ownership or necessary licenses concerning data important to the development or sale of our products
or service offerings, or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services. Any
of these events or factors could subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt
our sales and marketing of the affected products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results
of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

We
use a variety of raw materials and supplier-provided parts in our business. Significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints or production
disruptions, price increases, or tariffs could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products. 

Our
reliance on suppliers and commodity markets to secure components and raw materials (such as copper and steel as well as INCU ionic copper
solution), and on service providers to deliver our products, exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials
and services. That potential volatility is particularly acute in certain instances where we depend upon a single source. Issues with
suppliers (such as delivery or production disruptions, capacity constraints, quality issues, consolidations, closings or bankruptcies),
price increases, raw material shortages, or the decreased availability of trucks and other delivery services could have a material adverse
effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. 

We
use various strategies to lock in prices of expected purchases of certain raw materials; however, these efforts could cause us to pay
higher prices for a commodity when compared with the market price at the time the commodity is actually purchased or delivered. Tariffs
can also increase our costs, the impact of which is difficult to predict. However, we believe that our supply management and production
practices appropriately balance the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, these risks may have a material
adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

We
design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies. The introduction of new products and technologies involves
risks, and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. 

Our
future success depends on designing, developing, producing, selling and supporting innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies.
The regulations applicable to our products, as well as our customers product and service needs, change from time to time. Moreover,
regulatory changes may render our products and technologies non-compliant. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological
advancements or product improvements including those associated with regulatory changes depends on a variety of factors,
including: meeting development, production, and regulatory approval schedules; meeting performance plans and expectations; the availability
of raw materials and parts; our suppliers performance; the hiring, training and deployment of qualified personnel; achieving efficiencies;
identifying emerging regulatory and technological trends; validating innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies
and products; and the costs and customer acceptance of our new or improved products. 

Failure
to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our reputation with customers and negatively impact
our results. 

Product
and service quality issues could harm customer confidence in our company and our brands. If certain of our product offerings do not meet
applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety or quality, we can experience lost sales and increased
costs and we can and have been exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks. Actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns
could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement actions, which has also occurred in certain instances. In addition, when
our products fail to perform as expected, we are exposed to warranty, product liability claims, personal injury and other claims. 

We
maintain strict quality controls and procedures. However, we cannot be certain that these controls and procedures will reveal defects
in our products or their raw materials, which may not become apparent until after the products have been placed in use in the market.
Accordingly, there is a risk that products will have defects, which could require a product recall. Product recalls can be expensive
to implement, and may damage our reputation, customer relationships and market share. 

In
many jurisdictions, product liability claims are not limited to any specified amount of recovery. If any such claims or contribution
requests or requirements exceed our available insurance or if there is a product recall, there could be an adverse impact on our results
of operations. In addition, a recall or claim could require us to review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues
are present in other products, which could result in a significant disruption to our business and which could have a further adverse
impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will not experience
any material warranty or product liability claim losses in the future, that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims
or that we will have adequate reserves to cover any recalls, repair and replacement costs.

We
are subject to litigation, environmental, and other legal and compliance risks. 

We
are subject to a variety of litigation, legal and compliance risks. These risks relate to, among other things, personal injuries, intellectual
property rights, contract-related claims, taxes, environmental matters, employee health and safety, competition laws and laws governing
improper business practices. If found responsible in connection with such matters, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties,
repayments and other damages (in certain cases, treble damages), and experience reputational harm. 

On
October 8, 2021, a filing (the Filing was made with the Kuala Lumpur High Court by a reseller (the Reseller of the Company s INCU ionic nano copper solution (the Solution and the Reseller s related party (together
with the Reseller, the Plaintiffs ). The Reseller was authorized by WKL Eco Earth as its sole distributor of the Solution
(the WKL Distributor to resell the Solution together with a diffuser with a capacity of not more than 1000ml through a
tripartite agreement (the Tripartite Agreement entered into between (a) the Reseller, (b) the WKL Distributor and (c)
a solution packaging company (the Packaging Company ). WKL Eco Earth was not a party to the Tripartite Agreement and did
not directly authorize or engage the Reseller in the resale of the Solution. In the Filing, the Plaintiffs claimed against (i) WKL Eco
Earth; (ii) Dr. Low; (iii) Chan Kok Wei, (iv) the Packaging Company and (v) two directors of the Packaging Company for loss and damages
arising from an alleged breach of contract, defamation and tort of inducement. The Plaintiffs also alleged that pursuant to the Tripartite
Agreement, WKL Eco Earth was prohibited from selling the Solution to any party other than the WKL Distributor, and that the Tripartite
Agreement allowed for the resale of the Solution by the Plaintiffs without limitation, the Plaintiffs were not confined in their resale
of the Solution to a product consisting of a diffuser with a capacity of not more than 1000ml. The Company believes the claims are without
merit and will defend itself against the claims. 

As
a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in Malaysia. and other countries in which we operate. Those laws and
regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance.
Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses. Uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we operate,
structure our investments and enforce our rights. 

Changes
in environmental and climate change related-laws could require additional investments in product designs, which may be more expensive
or difficult to manufacture, qualify and sell and/or may involve additional product safety risks and could increase environmental compliance
expenditures. 

At
times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues, including litigation over the allocation of cleanup
costs, alleged personal injuries and property damage. Existing and future asbestos-related claims could adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. Personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging
that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions.
Property damage lawsuits may involve claims relating to environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. Even in litigation
where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision could have a material adverse effect on
our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, in particular with respect to environmental claims
in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations or where certain of our products have been manufactured and used. 

Our
failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, or effectively manage our employees, customers and business partners, could
severely damage our reputation, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

We
are subject to risks in relation to actions taken by us, our employees, third-party customers or third-party suppliers that constitute
violations of the anti-corruption laws and regulations. While we adopt strict internal procedures and work closely with relevant government
agencies to ensure compliance of our business operations with relevant laws and regulations, our efforts may not be sufficient to ensure
that we comply with relevant laws and regulations at all times. If we, our employees, third-party customers or third-party suppliers
violate these laws, rules or regulations, we could be subject to fines and/or other penalties. Actions by Malaysia regulatory authorities
or the courts to provide an alternative interpretation of the laws and regulations or to adopt additional anti-bribery or anti-corruption
related regulations could also require us to make changes to our operations. Our reputation, corporate image, and business operations
may be materially and adversely affected if we fail to comply with these measures or become the target of any negative publicity as a
result of actions taken by us, our employees, third-party customers or third-party suppliers. 

Our
business depends on the continued contributions made by Low Wai Koon Dr. Low ), as our founder, chief executive officer,
chief operating officer and chairman of the board, the loss of who may result in a severe impediment to our business, results of operation
and financial condition. 

Our
success is dependent upon the continued contributions made by founder, chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chairman
of the board, Dr. Low. We rely on his expertise in business operations when we are developing our business. We have no Key Man 
insurance to cover the resulting losses in the event that Dr. Low should die or resign. In order to mitigate this risk, the Group has
continued to invest in its personnel training as well as investment into its research and development department. 

However,
if Dr. Low cannot serve the Company or is no longer willing to do so, the Company may not be able to find alternatives in a timely manner
or at all. This would likely result in severe damage to our business operations and would have an adverse material impact on our financial
position and operating results. To sustain our operations, the Company may have to recruit and train replacement personnel at a higher
cost. In addition, if Dr. Low joins our competitors or develops similar businesses that are in competition with our Company, our business,
results of operation and financial conditions may also be negatively impacted.

Risks
Related to Doing Business in Malaysia 

Developments
in the social, political, regulatory and economic environment in Malaysia may have a material adverse impact on us. 

Our
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by social, political, regulatory and economic
developments in Malaysia. Such political and economic uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks of war, terrorism, nationalism,
nullification of contract, changes in interest rates, imposition of capital controls and methods of taxation. 

According
to Economy Outlook 2024 from Ministry of Finance Malaysia, global growth is projected to moderate in 2023 and 2024 following slow growth
in advanced economies; volatile financial market due to tightening monetary policy; prolonged geopolitical tensions; and increasing climatic
changes. Nevertheless, inflation continues to soften as markets head towards supply chain stabilisation. In addition, world trade is
projected to moderate in 2023 in line with weaker global demand. However, global trade is expected to increase in 2024 in tandem with
improved trade activity in advanced economies, and emerging market and developing economies EMDEs ). In the case of Malaysia,
the economy continued to expand amid these persistent challenges in the external environment. During the first half of 2023, GDP posted
a growth of 4.2 supported by resilient domestic demand, in particular private expenditure. 

Despite
escalating uncertainties in the global landscape, Malaysia s economy remains resilient. The GDP is forecast to expand by approximately
4 in 2023 and between 4 and 5 in 2024. The Government acknowledged the World Bank s forecast that Malaysia s growth will
be 4.3 in 2024, which is slightly higher than its initial estimate. This is in line with Malaysia s 2024 growth projection, which
will be achieved through robust domestic demand, effectively offsetting the challenges posed by the moderate global growth, supported
by the implementation of measures in the new National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), New Industrial Master Plan 2030 (NIMP 2030),
and the Mid-Term Review of the Twelfth Malaysia Plan (MTR of the Twelfth Plan). 

On
March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization or WHO declared the corona virus or COVID-19 a pandemic. To help counter the transmission
of COVID-19, from March 18, 2020 to April 26, 2022, the government of Malaysia initiated Movement Control Orders MCO ).
The MCO had resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of stores and facilities in Malaysia. Conditional
Movement Control Orders were introduced where most business sectors were allowed to operate under strict rules and Standard Operating
Procedures mandated by the government of Malaysia, followed by Recovery Movement Control Orders. At the height of the pandemic, on January
12, 2021, the Malaysian government even declared a state of emergency nationwide to combat COVID-19. On April 1, 2022, the Malaysian
government announced the country had begun transitioning into the endemic phase with further easing of restrictions. We are witnessing
the adverse impact on the purchasing power of consumers in Malaysia, where our products are mainly sold as a direct result of the prolonged
pandemic. As such, the extent to which the coronavirus may continue to adversely impact the Malaysian economy is uncertain. In the event
that the Malaysia economy suffers, demand for our products may diminish, which would in turn result in our profitability. This could
in turn result in a substantial need for restructuring of our business objectives and could result in a partial or entire loss of an
investment in our Company. 

We
are subject to foreign exchange control policies in Malaysia. 

The
ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us may be restricted by the foreign exchange control policies
in the countries where we operate. For example, there are foreign exchange policies in Malaysia which support the monitoring of capital
flows into and out of the country in order to preserve its financial and economic stability. The foreign exchange policies are administered
by the Foreign Exchange Administration, an arm of Bank Negara Malaysia BNM ), the central bank of Malaysia. The foreign
exchange policies monitor and regulate both residents and non-residents. Under the current Foreign Exchange Administration rules issued
by BNM, non-residents are free to repatriate any amount of funds from Malaysia in foreign currency other than the currency of Israel
at any time (subject to limited exceptions), including capital, divestment proceeds, profits, dividends, rental, fees and interest arising
from investment in Malaysia, subject to any withholding tax. In the event BNM or any other country where we operate introduces any restrictions
in the future, we may be affected in our ability to repatriate dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries in Malaysia or in such
other countries. Since we are a holding company and rely principally on dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries for our cash
requirements, any restrictions on such dividends or other payments could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition
and results of operation.

Many
of the economies in Asia, including Singapore, are experiencing substantial inflationary pressures which may prompt the governments to
take action to control the growth of the economy and inflation that could lead to a significant decrease in our profitability in the
future. 

While
many of the economies in Asia have experienced rapid growth over the last two decades, they currently are experiencing inflationary pressures.
As governments take steps to address the current inflationary pressures, there may be significant changes in the availability of bank
credit, interest rate increases, limitations on loans, or restrictions on currency conversions and foreign investment. There also may
be imposition of price controls. If prices for the products we source or if wages rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for
the rise in these costs, it may have an adverse effect on our profitability. If these or other similar restrictions are imposed by a
government to influence the economy, it may lead to a slowing of economic growth. Singapore s core inflation rose to 5.3 on a
year-on-year (y-o-y) basis in September 2022, compared to 5.1 in August 2022. The pickup in core inflation was on account of larger
increases in the prices of food, services and retail other goods. CPI (consumer price index) All Items inflation was 7.5 
year-over-year in September 2022, unchanged from that in August. 

(source:
https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/MAS/EPG/CPD/2022/Inflation202209.pdf) 

While
this inflationary trend will result in higher operational costs, we believe that this also strengthens our value proposition by emphasizing
potential savings to customers through improved productivity and workflow efficiency derived from our technology solutions. To mitigate
inflationary pressures, we will regularly review our pricing structure to ensure sustainable profitability. 

Risks
Related to Intellectual Property 

If
we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property and information, and protect against third party claims that
we are infringing on their intellectual property rights, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 

The
value of our business depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property including our patents applications and trademarks,
as well as our customer, employee, and customer data. Third parties may try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in
Asia and around the world. In addition, intellectual property rights and protections in Malaysia may be insufficient to protect material
intellectual property rights. Further, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing
on our intellectual property rights. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property. We may need
to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.
If we fail to protect our proprietary intellectual property and information, including with respect to any successful challenge to our
ownership of intellectual property or material infringements of our intellectual property, this failure could have a significant adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

If
we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are accused of infringing on the intellectual property
rights of others, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend
our rights. 

Our
commercial success will depend in part on our success in obtaining and maintaining patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and
other intellectual property rights in Malaysia and elsewhere and protecting our proprietary technology. If we do not adequately protect
our intellectual property and proprietary technology, competitors may be able to use our technologies or the goodwill we have acquired
in the marketplace and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. 

We
cannot provide any assurances that any of our pending patent applications that mature into issued patents will include a scope sufficient
to protect our products, any additional features we develop for our products or any new products. Other parties may have developed technologies
that may be related or competitive to our system, may have filed or may file patent applications and may have received or may receive
patents that overlap or conflict with our patent applications, either by claiming the same methods or devices or by claiming subject
matter that could dominate our patent position. Our patent position may involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore,
the scope, validity and enforceability of any patent claims that we may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued,
may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented. Proceedings challenging our patents could result in either loss
of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent
application. In addition, such proceedings may be costly. Thus, any patents that we may own may not provide any protection against competitors.
Furthermore, an adverse decision in an interference proceeding can result in a third party receiving the patent right sought by us, which
in turn could affect our ability to commercialize our products. 

25 | Page 

Though
an issued patent is presumed valid and enforceable, its issuance is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability and it may
not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Competitors
could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts,
willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our patents, or develop and obtain patent protection for more effective
technologies, designs or methods. 

We
may be unable to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants, suppliers, vendors,
former employees and current employees. 

Our
ability to enforce our patent rights depends on our ability to detect infringement. It may be difficult to detect infringers who do not
advertise the components that are used in their products. Moreover, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain evidence of infringement
in a competitor s or potential competitor s product. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages
or other remedies awarded if we were to prevail may not be commercially meaningful. 

In
addition, proceedings to enforce or defend our patents could put our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted
narrowly. Such proceedings could also provoke third parties to assert claims against us, including that some or all of the claims in
one or more of our patents are invalid or otherwise unenforceable. If any of our patents covering our products are invalidated or found
unenforceable, or if a court found that valid, enforceable patents held by third parties covered one or more of our products, our competitive
position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend our rights. 

The
degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that: 

any of our pending patent applications, if issued, will include claims having a scope sufficient to protect our products; 

any of our pending patent applications will be issued as patents; 

we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions; 

others will not develop similar or alternative technologies that do not infringe our patents; any of our patents will be found to ultimately
be valid and enforceable; 

any patents issued to us will provide a basis for an exclusive market for our commercially viable products, will provide us with any
competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties; 

we will develop additional proprietary technologies or products that are separately patentable; or 

our commercial activities or products will not infringe upon the patents of others. 

We
rely, in part, upon unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Further,
our trade secrets could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors.

Risks
Relating to Our Securities 

There
may not be sufficient liquidity in the market for our securities in order for investors to sell their securities. 

There
is currently only a limited public market for our ordinary share, which is listed on the Over-the-Counter Pink Sheets, and there can
be no assurance that a trading market will develop further or be maintained in the future. 

Volatility
in our shares price may subject us to securities litigation. 

The
market for our shares may have, when compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that our share price may
continue to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities
class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future,
be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management s
attention and resources. 

Our
ordinary share may be considered a penny stock and may be difficult to sell. 

The
SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a penny stock to be an equity security that has a market price of less
than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our ordinary
share is less than 5.00 per share and, therefore, it may be designated as a penny stock according to SEC rules. This designation
requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement
from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the ability
of brokers or dealers to sell our ordinary share and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares. 

The
market for penny stocks has experienced numerous frauds and abuses, which could adversely impact investors in our stock. 

OTC
Pink Sheet securities are frequent targets of fraud or market manipulation, both because of their generally low prices and because OTC
Pink Sheet reporting requirements are less stringent than those of the stock exchanges or NASDAQ. 

Patterns
of fraud and abuse include: 

Control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; 

Manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; 

Boiler room practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; 

Excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and mark-ups by selling broker-dealers; and 

Wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along
with the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor losses. 

Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market . 

We
have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future and any return on investment may be
limited to the value of our stock. 

We
have never paid any cash dividends on our ordinary share and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our ordinary share in the
foreseeable future and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock. We plan to retain any future earnings to finance
growth. 

We
are a smaller reporting company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller
reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. 

We
are currently a smaller reporting company , meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset- backed issuer, or a
majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and annual revenues of less than 50.0 million
during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a smaller reporting company, 
at such time as we cease being an emerging growth company, we will be required to provide additional disclosure in our
SEC filings. However, similar to an emerging growth companies , smaller reporting companies are able to provide
simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things,
only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings
due to our status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations
and financial prospects.

General
Risks 

Natural
disasters, epidemics or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition
and may not be fully covered by insurance. 

The
occurrence of one or more natural disasters, power outages or other unexpected events, including hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions, tsunamis, floods and other forms of severe weather, health epidemics, pandemics (including COVID-19) or other contagious outbreaks,
conflicts, wars or terrorist acts, in the U.S. or in other countries in which we or our suppliers or customers operate could adversely
affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, power outages or other unexpected events could damage or close one
or more of our facilities or disrupt our operations temporarily or long-term, such as by causing business interruptions or by affecting
the availability and/or cost of materials needed for manufacturing. We have only one factory and another assembly line that can manufacture
a specific product or product line. As a result, damage to or the closure of that factory may disrupt or prevent us from manufacturing
certain products. Existing insurance arrangements may not cover all of the costs or lost cash flows that may arise from such events.
The occurrence of any of these events could also increase our insurance and other operating costs or harm our sales. 

We
may be affected by global economic, capital market and political conditions, and conditions in the construction, transportation and infrastructure
industries in particular. 

Our
business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and
geopolitical risks and conditions, including credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, fluctuations in residential,
commercial and industrial construction activity, pandemic health issues (including COVID-19 and its effects), natural disasters, commodity
prices, energy costs, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, levels of government spending and deficits, trade policies (including tariffs,
boycotts and sanctions), regulatory changes, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the
global economy. 

These
economic and political conditions affect our business in a number of ways. Additionally, the tightening of credit in the capital markets
could adversely affect the ability of our customers, including individual end-customers and businesses, to obtain financing for significant
purchases and operations, which could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services. Similarly, tightening
credit may adversely affect our supply base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress
or bankruptcy. Additionally, because we have a number of factories and suppliers in foreign countries, the imposition of tariffs or sanctions
or unusually restrictive border crossing rules could adversely affect our supply chain, operations and overall business. 

Our
business and financial performance is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases
in business and consumer spending and construction (both residential and commercial as well as remodelling). 

Our
business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. 

Our
ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce.
Failure to ensure that we have leadership with the necessary skill sets and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth
objectives, execute our strategic plan and effectively transition our leadership.

On October 8, 2021, a filing (the Filing was made with the
Kuala Lumpur High Court by a reseller (the Reseller of the Company s INCU ionic nano copper solution (the Solution and the Reseller s related party (together with the Reseller, the Plaintiffs ). The Reseller was authorized by WKL
Eco Earth s sole distributor of the Solution (the WKL Distributor to resell the Solution together with a diffuser
with a capacity of not more than 1000ml through a tripartite agreement (the Tripartite Agreement entered into between (a)
the Reseller, (b) the WKL Distributor and (c) a solution packaging company (the Packaging Company ). WKL Eco Earth was not
a party to the Tripartite Agreement and did not directly authorize or engage the Reseller in the resale of the Solution. In the Filing,
the Plaintiffs claimed against (i) WKL Eco Earth; (ii) Dr. Low; (iii) Chan Kok Wei, (iv) the Packaging Company and (v) two directors of
the Packaging Company for loss and damages arising from an alleged breach of contract, defamation and tort of inducement. The Plaintiffs

 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in
this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual
results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such
differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited consolidated financial
statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles U.S. GAAP ). 

Plan
of Operation and Funding 

We
expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through internally generated funds and proceeds from issuances of
securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 

Existing
working capital, proceeds from issuance of securities, further advances, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to
fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have
financed operations to date through internally generated funds, advances and proceeds from issuance of securities. In connection
with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i)
research and development, (ii) expansion of product offerings; (iii) geographical expansion; and (iv) marketing expenses. We intend
to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and
generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity will result in dilution to our current
shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional
financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on
acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could
significantly and materially restrict our business operations.

Revenue 

Revenue
for FYE 2023 was 388,038 compared to revenue in FYE 2022 of 1,190,616, a decrease of 802,578 or approximately 67 . The drop in revenue
is mainly due to the decrease in sales in air purifier products as a result of rollback of preventative measures taken by businesses
and public from spreading infection as the World and society progresses towards living with Covid-19. 

Being first mover in launching EvoAir TM , first-of-its-kind eco-friendly
air-conditioner with granted patent or utility model/ patent or utility model pending HECS system proprietary system, the Group faced
both opportunities and challenges. In the course of applying for some of the certifications, safety and performance testing, the relevant
authorities/ organizations faced the challenges in assigning our products in the appropriate category under conventional air-conditioner
regime. There are instances whereby some of these authorities/ organizations do not possess the relevant equipment to conduct testings.
It took a lot of education, discussions, deliberations and working with the authorities/ organizations to work out solutions to resolve
compliance and testing matters. On the positive note, one of the authorities advised us to apply under a new category, Hybrid Air
Conditioner. The duration of the application processes were longer than that of typical certifications and testing for conventional air-conditioners. 

Being
a first mover, notwithstanding many of our corporate clients who were impressed and showed keen interest in our products,
EvoAir TM , many of them took a few months to conduct study on their own accord on performance and the energy savings by
our products. The Company is building up its traction for the evoair TM hybrid air-conditioners for both residentials and
commercial/ industrial units through distribution channels, projects, building and businesses as well as private labelling and
licensing model. During the financial year, we have entered into agreements with distributors, partners, customers to build up sales
pipeline.

Cost
of revenue 

Cost
of revenues was 424,189 or 109 of revenues in the FYE 2023, as compared to 952,228 or 80 of revenues in the FYE 2022. The decline
in cost of revenue is in line with the drop in sales. Cost of revenues includes production costs and purchases
of goods. 

Gross
(loss)/ profit 

Gross
loss was 36,151 for FYE 2023 or 9 of revenues compared gross profit 238,388 for FYE 2022 or 20 of revenues. The decline in gross
profit margin was attributable to the drop in sales of air purifier products, of which the product range contributed higher gross profit
margin. Besides, the decrease of gross profit is mainly due to the Company s evoair TM products with higher cost
of revenue from manufacturing and related costs as well as lack of economy of scale during commercialization stage. The Company anticipates
improvement of income and gross profit margin with the improvement of revenue streams from distributor and dealership model, projects
as well as private labeling and licensing model. 

Operating
expenses 

Operating
expenses totaled 6,097,019 for FYE 2023, compared to 4,856,039 in operating expenses for FYE 2022, or an increase of 1,240,980 or
26 . The operating expenses include salary and related expenses, commissions, rental, patents and trademarks application/renewal and
related fee and professional and compliance fees. The increase in operating expenses were
mainly due to full year amortization of intangible assets in FYE2023 as compared to 8-month amortization of intangibles in
FYE 2022 as well as payment of commission for capital raising. 

Other expense 

Other
expense decreased significantly mainly due to a one-time amortization of beneficial conversion feature of convertible bonds
 1,005,645 in FYE 2022. Other expense in FYE2023 primarily included 205,949 realized foreign exchange loss net with 13,276 other
income received from Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore for Job Growth Incentive Payout. 

Net
loss 

Premised
on the factors discussed above, the Company incurred a net loss of 6,317,373 for FYE 2023, compared to a net loss of 5,556,627 for
FYE 2022. The continuous net loss is attributable to the Group s focused effort in building
up the traction and sales pipeline, applying necessary certifications, testings, patents and trademark and creating resources to meet the business expansion needs of the Group s as well as lack of economies of
scale.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements. 

As
of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Revenue
recognition 

Our
revenue recognition policy is in compliance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers whereby revenue is recognized
when a customer obtains control of promised goods and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive
in exchange for those goods. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue
and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that we expect
to receive in exchange for those goods. We apply the following five-step model to determine this amount: 

(i) 
 identification
 of the promised goods and services in the contract; 

(ii) 
 determination
 of whether the promised goods and services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the
 contract; 

(iii) 
 measurement
 of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; 

(iv) 
 allocation
 of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 

(v) 
 recognition
 of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. 

31 | Page 

We
only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange
for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception,
we review the contract to determine which performance obligations we must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct.
We recognize as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance
obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, our performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time,
typically upon delivery for local sales and upon shipment of the products for export sale. 

For
all reporting periods, we have not disclosed the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for all product revenue contracts with
an original expected length of one year or less, which is an optional exemption that is permitted under the adopted rules. 

Estimates
and Assumptions 

In
preparing our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures.
Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities, and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but that are
inherently uncertain and unpredictable. We are also subject to other risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ
from estimated amounts. Significant estimates in FYE 2023 and 2022 include the assumptions used to value tax liabilities, derivative
financial instruments, estimates of the allowance for deferred tax assets, accounts receivable allowance, impairment of long-lived
assets and inventory write-offs. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company s financial statements as of August 31, 2023, is prepared using U.S. GAAP 
applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The Company has not yet established a sustainable ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and
allow it to continue as a going concern. 

As
of August 31, 2023, and August 31, 2022, the
Company had an accumulated deficit of 13,523,266 and 7,465,373 respectively. The Company
incurred net loss of 6,057,893 and 5,231,877 for the years ended August 31, 2023, and August 31, 2022, respectively. The cash used
in operating activities were 1, 674 , 395 
and 1,540,167 for FYE 2023 and 2022, respectively. It was brought to the attention of the Management to assess going
concern considering all facts and circumstances about the foreseeable future of the Company as well as its assets and liabilities on
the basis that it will be able to realize and discharge them in the normal course of business. 

With
the injection of a HVAC business into the Company HVAC Business pursuant
to the Transactions (defined in Part I, Item I of this Form 10K ), the Management believes that the actions to be taken by the Management to further
implement the business plans for the HVAC Business including expansion in product offerings, geographical expansion, generate
revenue through expansion of revenue streams and customer base (retail, commercial, industrial, projects as well as private label
and licensing clientele), improvement of profitability by achieving economies of scale provide the opportunity for the Company to
continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company is also working on raising additional funding to finance the operations as
well as business expansion. 

The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and, accordingly
financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Commitments 

We
have no material commitments as of August 31, 2023.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Except
for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under the authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC is the sole
source of authoritative U.S. GAAP literature recognized by the FASB and applicable to the Company. Management has reviewed the aforementioned
rules and releases and believes any effect will not have a material impact on the Company s present or future financial statements. 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 adds the CECL
impairment model to U.S. GAAP that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Modified retrospective adoption is required
with any cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. ASU 2016-13 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within the year of adoption. Early adoption is permitted
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect
the application of the CECL impairment model to have a significant impact on its allowance for uncollectible amounts for accounts receivable.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of EvoAir Holdings Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of EvoAir Holdings Inc. (the Company as of August 31, 2023
and 2022, the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the two years ended August 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes to the financial statements and schedule (collectively, the
financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company as of August 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended August 31, 2023, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going concern uncertainty 

The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements,
the Company had an accumulated deficit of 13,523,266. The Company incurred net loss of 6,057,893 for year ended August 31, 2023. The
cash used in operating activities were 1,674,395 for the year ended August 31, 2023. The Company has accumulated loss since inception
which raise doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described
in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.

to generate. If identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the
carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value.

ITEM 9A. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An
evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2023. Based on our management s evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, our management concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in SEC rules and forms. 

A
material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, such that there is a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In
connection with the assessment described above, management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material
weaknesses at August 31, 2023: 

Due
 to our limited resources, we do not have enough accounting personnel with extensive experience in maintaining books and records and
 preparing financial statements in accordance with US GAAP which could lead to untimely identification and resolution of accounting
 matters inherent in our financial transactions in accordance with US GAAP. 

The
 Company has insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting, which led to inadequate financial
 statement closing process. 

The
 Company has a lack of segregation of duties, a lack of audit committee or independent governance/oversight. 

Our
management also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year August 31, 2023
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
