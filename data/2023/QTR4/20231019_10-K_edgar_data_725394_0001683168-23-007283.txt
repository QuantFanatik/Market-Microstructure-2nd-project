Backlog 

Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenues
we expect to recognize in the future from agreements awarded and in progress. Backlog is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting
principles and is not a measure of contract profitability. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to methodologies
used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts. The backlog values we disclose include anticipated revenues associated with:
(1) the original agreement amounts; (2) change orders for which we have received written confirmations from the applicable customers;
(3) change orders for which we expect to receive confirmations in the ordinary course of business; and (4) claims that we have
made against customers. We do not include expected revenues of agreements related to unconsolidated joint ventures in our backlog, except
to the extent of any contract awards we may receive from those joint ventures. 

For amounts included in backlog that are attributable
to claims, we include unapproved claims in backlog when we have a legal basis to do so, consider collection to be probable and believe
we can reliably estimate the ultimate value. Claims revenue is included in backlog to the extent of the lesser of the amounts management
expects to recover or associated costs incurred. 

Backlog may not be indicative of future operating
results, and agreements in our backlog may be cancelled, modified or otherwise altered by customers. We can provide no assurance as to
the profitability of our contracts reflected in backlog. 

The Dalrada Precision Manufacturing segment has generated a backlog
of approximately 900,000,000 over a seven-year period with approximately 40,000,000 within the initial twelve-month period.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and applied on a
consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods. 

We regularly evaluate the accounting policies
and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in note (1)
of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information
from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances.
Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 

Accrued Payroll Taxes 

The total balance for Federal Accrued Payroll
Taxes is accumulated on a quarterly basis beginning on their respective quarterly filing dates. Accrued Interest is compounded daily at
an Effective Annual Interest Rate of approximately seven percent. The individual quarterly sub-totals have a calculated expiration date
of ten years according to the Internal Revenue Service IRS statute of limitations. This timeline can be extended because
of bankruptcy or other legal action that is filed by the Company (Code 520 per IRS Federal Account Transcripts). Code 520 effectively
stops the clock for the Statute of limitations until the bankruptcy or other legal action has been removed (Code 521 per IRS Federal Account
Transcripts). In addition to the number of days between Code 520 and 521, every Code 520 automatically extends the IRS Statute of limitations
by 30 days. As the quarterly sub-totals surpass their respective Calculated Expiration Date the Company removes the liability
from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and an equivalent amount is recognized as Gain on expiration of accrued payroll taxes 
on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The amount owing may be subject to additional late filing fees and
penalties that are not quantifiable as at the date of these consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes and accounts for revenue
in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606 as a principal on the sale of goods and services. Pursuant
to ASC 606, revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any sales incentives and
amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring
control over a product or service to a customer. 

Use of Estimates 

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The
Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the revenue, valuation of inventory, valuation of acquired assets and
liabilities, variables used in the computation of share-based compensation, litigation, and evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets
for impairment. 

The Company bases its estimates and assumptions
on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses
that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from
the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results
of operations will be affected. 

17 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company records stock-based compensation in
accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods
or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration
received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees
and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value using quoted market prices
of the equity instruments issued. 

Business
Combination 

ASC 805,
Business Combinations ASC 805 ), applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations to all acquisitions
where the acquirer gains a controlling interest, regardless of whether consideration was exchanged. ASC 805 establishes principles and
requirements for how the acquirer: a) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination
or a gain from a bargain purchase; and c) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate
the nature and financial effects of the business combination. Accounting for acquisitions requires the Company to recognize,
separately from goodwill, the assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition
date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets acquired and
the liabilities assumed. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities
assumed at the acquisition date, the estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement
period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values
of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded with a corresponding gain or
loss being recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible
assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other ASC 350 ). ASC 350 requires that goodwill and
other intangibles with indefinite lives should be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate
that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. 

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting
unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (June 30 for the Company) and between annual
tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
value. The Company considers its market capitalization and the carrying value of its assets and liabilities, including goodwill, when
performing its goodwill impairment test. When conducting its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company initially performs a qualitative
evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. If it is determined by a qualitative evaluation that it is
more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, the Company then applies a two-step impairment test. The two-step impairment test first
compares the fair value of the Company's reporting unit to its carrying or book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds
its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company determines the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and if the carrying
value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company recorded an impairment of goodwill in the amount of 433,556 and 218,308 during
the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

18 

An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary
asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual or other legal
rights. Separable assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, etc. Examples of intangible assets include computer software, licenses, trademarks,
patents, films and copyrights. The Company s intangible assets are finite lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 

Purchase Price Allocation 

Upon the completion of a business combination,
the consideration transferred as well as the assets and liabilities acquired must be recorded at their acquisition date fair values. Upon
identification of the acquirer and determination of the acquisition date, business combinations are accounted for through the preparation
of a Purchase Price Allocation (PPA). We take into consideration the five steps when completing a PPA: 

 Step 1: Determine the fair value of consideration
paid; 

 Step 2: Revalue all existing assets and liabilities
(excluding intangible assets and goodwill which are addressed in step 3 to 5 below) to their acquisition date fair values; 

 Step 3: Identify the intangible assets acquired; 

 Step 4: Determine the fair value of identifiable
intangible assets acquired; and, 

 Step 5: Allocate the remaining consideration to
goodwill and assess the reasonableness of the overall conclusion 

Related Party Transactions 

Related party transactions are conducted with
parties with which the Company has a close association, such as majority owned subsidiaries, its executive, managers, and their families.
The types of transactions that can be conducted between related parties are many, such as sales, asset transfers, leases, lending arrangements,
guarantees, allocations of common costs, and the filing of consolidated tax returns. The Company discloses any transaction that would
impact the decision making of the users of its consolidated financial statements. This involves the following disclosures: 

General. The Company discloses all material related party transactions, including the nature of the relationship, the nature of the transactions, the dollar amounts of the transactions, the amounts due to or from related parties. 

Receivables. The Company separately discloses any receivables from officers, employees, or affiliated entities. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and
Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity , as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying
accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among
other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated
into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the
debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded
conversion features in equity, and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of
the if-converted method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent
with the Company s current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but
only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company adopted the guidance on July 1, 2022. 

19 

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08 
Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers ASU 2021-08 ).
Under current accounting standards, contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination are to be recorded at
fair value using the ASC 805 measurement principle. ASU 2021-08 requires the acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract
liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers as if the acquirer
had originated the contracts rather than at fair value. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with
early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2021-08 on a prospective basis as of July 1, 2021. The election to use
practical expedients allowed under ASU 2021-08 will be applied on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. There was no impact to the Company s
consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date. 

The FASB and the SEC have issued certain other
accounting pronouncements as of June 30, 2023 that will become effective in subsequent periods; however, management does not believe that
any of these pronouncements would have significantly affected the Company s financial accounting measurements or disclosures had
they been in effect during the periods for which financial statements are included in this annual report, nor does management believe
those pronouncements would have a significant effect on the Company s future financial position or results of operations

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM (PCAOB ID N0. 324) 

To the Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders of Dalrada Financial Corporation 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet of Dalrada Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company as of June 30, 2023, the related consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year ended June
30, 2023, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, referred to as the consolidated financial
statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of June 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for year then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

 The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operating activities and continues to have a working
capital deficit. This raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans
in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

 These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial
statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

 The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated
to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter
in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

F- 1 

Impairment Assessment of Goodwill 

 Description of the Matter: 

 As discussed in Notes 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12 and
16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had a number of business combinations during the current and prior fiscal years
that led to the recording of goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of ASC No.
350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other ASC No. 350 ). We identified the impairment assessment of the Company s
goodwill acquired in these acquisitions as a critical audit matter as of June 30, 2023. Auditing the Company s impairment tests
was complex and highly judgmental because (i) there was significant judgment used by management to develop the fair value measurement,
which led to a high degree of audit judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures relating to fair value measurement; and (ii) there
was significant effort in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value measurement and significant assumptions
and projections used by management. 

How We Addressed the Matter in our Audit: 

 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures
and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. To test the potential
impairment of the Company s goodwill, our audit procedures included, among others, testing management s application of the
relevant accounting guidance, and testing of the significant assumptions used by the Company to develop forecasted results for the reporting
unit, including projected revenue growth and operating margins. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management s estimates,
as well as performed a sensitivity analysis of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units
that would result from changes in the assumptions. We compared the significant assumptions to current and past industry, market and economic
trends. Additionally, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates 

Revenue Recognition 

 Description of the Matter: 

 As disclosed in Note 2, 9 and 13, the Company
follows the guidance provided in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and recognizes revenue when or as the Company
satisfies a customer agreement performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer, in an amount that
reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. A presumption of fraud risk exists
related to revenue recognition and judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for each performance obligation
within their customer agreements. We identified the Company s recording of revenues as a critical audit matter because there was
significant judgment applied by management in its determination of the appropriate revenue recognition criteria, including assessing the
indicators for when control is transferred to the customer, assessing management s evaluation and allocation of the standalone transaction
prices to the performance obligations, as well as management s assessment of the impact on revenue recognition of non-standard terms
and conditions. In turn, this led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating
the results of those procedures. 

How We Addressed the Matter in our Audit: 

 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures
and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. Our principal audit
procedures related to the Company s revenue recognition included gaining an understanding of internal controls related to revenue
recognition including management s controls related to the evaluation of performance obligations and the allocation of the total
contract consideration to these performance obligations noted in their customer agreements. We evaluated management s revenue recognition
policies and practices including the reasonableness of management s judgments and assumptions relating to the timing of revenue
recognition of those performance obligations. In addition, we selected customer agreements and performed the following testing procedures:
1) Obtained and read the customer agreements or contracts for each selected agreement. 2) Evaluated and tested management s identification
of significant terms for completeness, including the identification of distinct performance obligations. 3) Tested revenue contracts and
underlying support to evaluate appropriateness of management s revenue recognition. 4) Tested the completeness and accuracy of management s
calculation of revenue and associated timing of revenue recognized (i.e., revenue being recognized at a point in time vs over time). 5)
These procedures also included, among others, testing management s process for developing estimates for contractual allowances and
project completion, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the
historical contractual allowance and collection data from the Company s billing system, which is an input to the methodology, and
(iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management s assumptions used to estimate contractual allowances (net accounts), as well
as testing relevant inputs and project costs incurred used to develop estimates of project progress compared to the overall project budget. 

We have served as the Company s auditor
since 2023.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of Dalrada Financial Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial
Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet of Dalrada Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (collectively the Company as of June 30, 2022,
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

 These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are
required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Going Concern 

 The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company has had recurring losses, used cash flows from operating activities and has a significant working capital
deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these
matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty. 

Critical Audit Matters 

 The critical audit matters
communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which
it relates.

Related Party Transactions including Revenue Recognition 

Description of the Matter: 

 As discussed in Notes
2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has significant related party transactions involving
revenue, accounts receivable, accounts payable, loans payable, advances, and expenses paid by and to multiple related parties. Our auditing
of management s identification of related parties and the related transactions including recognition of revenue was complex and
is based on a thorough understanding the Company s related party relationships, contracts, and business activities. These were the
principal considerations that led us to determine this as a critical audit matter. 

How We Addressed the
Matter in our Audit: 

 We evaluated the controls
over the Company s identification of, and recording of related party transactions, and of the revenue recognition process, including
walkthroughs of internal controls. We confirmed certain balances and transactions with related parties. To evaluate the related party s
satisfaction of performance obligations, our audit procedures included, among others, reviewing contracts and evaluating management s
assumptions used to determine the distinct performance obligations, and reviewing the branding work performed by the Company for various
products. In addition, to identify undisclosed related party transactions we performed the following: 1) made inquiries of management
and other individuals throughout the Company; 2) obtained a selection of expenses and reviewed for related party indicators; 3) reviewed
public filings and other online information available; 4) confirmed with the transfer agent regarding significant shareholders; and 5)
related procedures performed in other parts of the audit engagement. 

Revenue Recognition 

 Description of the Matter: 

 As disclosed in Note
2, 9, and 13, the Company recognizes revenue when or as the Company satisfies a customer agreement performance obligation by transferring
control of a product or service to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange
for those products or services. In determining revenue recognition for certain customer agreements, significant judgment was exercised
by the Company, and included the following: 1) An assessment of the products and services promised in contracts or customer agreements,
and the identification of a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a product or service that is distinct.
2) Determination of relative standalone selling price for distinct performance obligations. 3) The timing of product or service delivery
for performance obligations. 4) Net revenues and accounts receivable recognized from healthcare insurers and government payers consist
of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects
to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience and, additionally for healthcare insurers, the
terms of the Company s contractual arrangements. As disclosed by management, the process for estimating revenues and the ultimate
collection of receivables associated involves significant assumptions and judgments. Given these factors, the related audit effort in
evaluating management s judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive, which led us to
determine this as a critical audit matter. 

How We Addressed the
Matter in our Audit: 

 Our principal audit procedures
related to the Company s revenue recognition for these customer agreements included an evaluation of the controls related to the
identification of distinct performance obligations and the determination of the timing of revenue recognition. We also evaluated management s
significant accounting policies related to certain customer agreements. In addition, we selected customer agreements and performed the
following procedures: 1) Obtained and read the customer agreements or contracts for each selected agreement. 2) Evaluated and tested management s
identification of significant terms for completeness, including the identification of distinct performance obligations. 3) Evaluated the
appropriateness of management s application of their accounting principles, in their determination of revenue recognition conclusions.
4) Tested the mathematical accuracy of management s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the
consolidated financial statements. 5) These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the estimate
for contractual allowances, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy
of the historical contractual allowance and collection data from the Company s billing system, which is an input to the methodology,
and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management s assumptions used to estimate contractual allowances (net accounts receivable).

Going Concern 

These consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities
in the normal course of business. As of June 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company had a working capital deficit of and ,
respectively. The Company incurred negative cash flows from operations for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, and raises substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent
upon the successful financing through equity and/or debt investors and growing the subsidiaries anticipated to be profitable while reducing
investments in areas that are not expected to have long-term benefits. The Company expects to fund any short-term operational deficits
primarily through collection of outstanding accounts receivable from medical insurance providers, Medicare, pharmaceutical sales, the
sale of Likido units as well as loans from related parties. 

The Company bases its estimates and
assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs
and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and
adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results,
future results of operations will be affected. 

 and of total revenues, respectively. Also, healthcare insurers
and government payers amounted to total revenues of and for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The accounts receivable related to both healthcare insurers and government payers is and as of June 30, 2023 and
2022, respectively. 

During the year ended June 30, 2023, DES s Averett University
project accounted for , or of total revenues. 

As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, 
and is owed by customers from the sale of Likido units, respectively. 

The Company s financial instruments
consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, notes payable, and amounts due to related
parties. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on Level 1 inputs, which consist of quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because
of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations. 

The fair value of the contingent consideration
obligations was based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment
with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria. The measurement was based on significant inputs that were not observable
in the market, therefore, the Company classified this liability as Level 3 in the following tables:

Contingent consideration 

The Company records a contingent consideration
liability relating to stock price guarantees included in its acquisition and consulting agreements. The estimated fair value of the contingent
consideration is recorded using a significant observable measure and is therefore classified as a Level 3 financial instrument. 

The fair value of the contingent consideration
liability related to the Company s business combinations is valued based on a forward contract and the guaranteed equity value at
settlement as defined in the acquisition agreement (see Note 4. Business Combinations and Asset Acquisition). The fair value of
the contingent consideration is then calculated based on the guaranteed equity value at settlement as defined in the acquisition agreement.
(See Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies ).

Pala and Empower have a standardized
approach to estimate the amount of consideration that we expect to be entitled to for its COVID-19 testing revenue, including the impact
of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions. The Company principally estimates the allowance for
credit losses by pool based on historical collection experience, the current credit worthiness of the customers, current economic conditions,
expectations of future economic conditions and the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding. Adjustments to our estimated
contractual allowances and implicit patient price concessions are recorded in the current period as changes in estimates. 

Machinery and equipment 

Leasehold improvements 

Estimated useful lives are periodically
assessed to determine if changes are appropriate. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired
or otherwise disposed of, the cost of these assets and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the Consolidated
Balance Sheet and any resulting gains or losses are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the period of disposal.

An intangible asset is an identifiable
non-monetary asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual
or other legal rights. Separable assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, etc. Examples of intangible assets include computer software,
licenses, trademarks, patents, films, and copyrights. The Company s intangible assets are finite lived assets and are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 

t necessary as of June 30, 2023, or 2022. 

Net revenues from COVID-19 testing
accounted for over and of the Company s total net revenues for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and
primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low-dollar transactions. Pala and Empower, which provides clinical testing services
and other services, satisfies its performance obligations and recognizes revenues primarily upon completion of the testing process (when
results are reported) or when services have been rendered. Pala and Empower do not invoice the patients themselves for testing but relies
on healthcare insurers and government payers for reimbursement for COVID-19 testing. Pala has a standardized approach to estimate the
amount of consideration that we expect to be entitled to, including the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and
patient price concessions. We regularly assess the state of our billing operations in order to identify issues which may impact the collectability
of receivables or revenue estimates. We believe that the collectability of our receivables is directly linked to the quality of our billing
processes, most notably those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services we provide. As
such, we strive to implement best practices and work with our third-party billing company to reduce the number of requisitions
that we receive from healthcare providers with missing or incorrect billing information. We believe that our collection and revenue estimation
processes, along with our close monitoring of our billing operations, help to reduce the risk associated with material adjustments to
reserve estimates. However, changes to our estimate of the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials) and patient price
concessions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition in the period that the estimates are adjusted.
Adjustments to our estimated contractual allowances and implicit patient price concessions are recorded in the current period as changes
in estimates. Although we have limited track record, further adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts, may be recorded
upon settlement. 

DES recognizes revenue on energy savings
contracts where it provides design, engineering and equipment upgrades to obtain energy savings through Environmental, Social, and Governance ESG targets. DES recognizes revenue through two performance obligations: 1) the Energy Savings Report (point in time);
and 2) functional IP license (point in time with a significant financing component and royalty and variable consideration constraint).
Up to and upon completion of an energy savings project, DES calculates the monthly energy savings based on prior and current energy consumption
totals. Upon completion of a project, the customer pays monthly fixed payments which represents a financing component. DES recognized
monthly interest income and royalty revenue when the constraint from the energy savings percentage is known. DES records
revenue as it provides additional management, consulting, and other services as they are incurred. 

DES records a sales-type where the
Company is the lessor. The Company records its investment in the plant and equipment, used to upgrade a customer s real property,
leased to franchisees on a net basis, which is comprised of the present value of fixed lease payments not yet received over the course
of the energy savings agreements. The current and long-term portions of our net investment in sales-type leases are included in Accounts
Receivable, net related parties and Long-term receivables related parties respectively in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Unearned income is recognized as interest income over the lease term. Sales-type leases result in the recognition of gain
or loss at the commencement of the lease, which is recorded to Revenues related party in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 

DepTec and Bothof recognize revenues
using a cost-based input method, by which we use actual costs incurred relative to the total estimated contract costs to determine, as
a percentage, progress toward contract completion. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in
which such losses are determined. 

The Company also earns service revenue
from its other subsidiaries, including information technology and consulting services via Prakat, educational programs, and courses via
IHG, management services for Solas, and custom parts manufacturing for Dalrada Precision Parts. For Prakat, Solas and Dalrada Precision
Parts, revenues are recognized when performance obligations have been satisfied and the services are complete. This is generally at a
point of time upon written completion and client acceptance of the project or product, which represents transfer of control to the customer.
For IHG, revenues are recognized over the course of a semester while services are performed.

The Company determined that Pala is
a Variable Interest Entity VIE we believe that the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly
impact the economic performance of Pala, and accordingly, Dalrada is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The Company has consolidated
the activities of the VIE. 

Pursuant to the partnership
agreement, Dalrada contributed equity in the amount of

If at the end of the 24-month warrant
distribution period, beginning on the effective date of October 17, 2022 (the Distribution Period ), the value of cashless
warrants does not equate to (the Target Amount in value, then the Company shall issue additional cashless warrants
equal to the shortfall between the value of the Warrants Consideration and the Target Amount (the Valuation Shortfall ). 

The value of the Warrant Consideration
to the selling shareholder is . The Company records the value as stock-based compensation on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period of 24-months:

income taxes reflect the net tax effects of: (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes; and (b) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We record net deferred
tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all
available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable
income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. Significant components of deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2023, and

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b)
under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of December
31, 2022, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c) and Rule 15d-15(e). 

Management s Annual
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

The Company s management, with the participation
of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such an evaluation, the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that certain internal controls over financial reporting were not effective
as of June 30, 2023 due to the material weaknesses described in further detail below. 

Previously Reported Material Weaknesses in
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, we identified material weaknesses in the Company s control environment. 

To address our material weaknesses, we developed
a remediation plan which included the implementation and enhancement of various policies, procedures, and controls. In executing our remediation
plan, during Fiscal 2023, the Company hired accounting experts to address technical accounting transactions, purchase price allocations
and other accounting activity. We also implemented a strict travel and reimbursement policy and enhanced our Board of Directors and Audit
Committee for better oversight of our financial reporting processes. 

22 

Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of June 30, 2023, we
continue to have material weaknesses in the Company s control environment. Regarding the overall financial reporting structure of
the Company, there is not currently a comprehensive and formalized financial reporting policies and procedures manual in place. The following
sets forth internal control weaknesses: 

- 
 performing reconciliations 

- 
 preparing adequate and complete schedules
across the various consolidated entities including roll forwards, revenue recognition, and allowance estimates 

- 
 oversight of foreign entities 

This lack of formalized processes was a contributing
factor to which a number of inquiries were raised by the audit team and led to numerous post-closing entries subsequent to the commencement
of our audit procedures. 

Management s remediation plan will focus
on standardizing our reconciliation process including roll forwards and revenue recognition procedures. We will also revise allowance
estimates based on June 30, 2023 year-end adjustments. We look to enhance the continued improvement of our policies, procedures, and internal
controls over our control environment and risk assessment. 

No Attestation Report by Independent
Registered Accountant 

The effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, has not been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm by virtue of our exemption
from such requirement as a smaller reporting company. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in internal control
over financial reporting except as noted above.

Director Independence 

The OTC Bulletin Board does not have a requirement
that a majority of our Board of Directors be independent. However, with respect to the definition of independence utilized by NASDAQ,
our officers and directors would be deemed to be independent. 

Our Audit Committee is comprised of our officers
and directors. NASDAQ requires at least three members on the Audit Committee, each of whom must be independent. NASDAQ also requires that,
if its Chief Executive Officer s compensation is determined by its Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee must be comprised
solely of independent directors. The Company currently does not meet either of these requirements. 

The NASDAQ rules have both objective tests and
a subjective test for determining who is an independent director. The objective tests state, for example, that a director
is not considered independent if he or she is an employee of the Company or is a partner, executive officer or controlling stockholder
of an entity to which the Company made, or from which the Company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years
that exceed the greater of 200,000 or 5 of the recipient s consolidated gross revenue for that year or a family member serves
in the current fiscal year or has served at any time during the last three fiscal years as an executive officer of the Company. The subjective
test states that an independent director must be a person who lacks a relationship that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere
with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. 

Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services 

The Company paid or accrued the following fees
