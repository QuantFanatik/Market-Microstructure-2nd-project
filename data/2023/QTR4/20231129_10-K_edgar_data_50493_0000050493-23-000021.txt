PART I Item 1. BUSINESS General Ingles Markets, Incorporated, a North Carolina corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, Ingles, or the Company, we, us or our ), is a leading supermarket chain in the southeast United States and operates a total of 198 supermarkets in North Carolina (75), Georgia (65), South Carolina (35), Tennessee (21), Virginia (1) and Alabama (1). The Company remodels, expands and relocates stores in these communities and builds stores in new locations to retain and grow its customer base while retaining a high level of customer service and convenience. Ingles supermarkets offer customers a wide variety of nationally advertised food products, including grocery, meat and dairy products, produce, frozen foods and other perishables, and non-food products. Non-food products include fuel centers, pharmacies, health and beauty care products and general merchandise. The Company also offers quality private label items and locally-sourced items throughout its market areas. The Company believes that customer service and convenience, modern stores and competitive prices on a broad selection of quality merchandise are essential to developing and retaining a loyal customer base. The Company has an ongoing renovation and expansion plan to add stores in its target markets and modernize the appearance and layout of its existing stores. The Company s new and remodeled supermarkets provide an enhanced level of customer convenience in order to accommodate the lifestyle of today s shoppers. Design features of the Company s modern stores focus on selling products in perishable departments featuring local organic and home meal replacement items, in-store pharmacies, on-premises fuel centers, and an expanded selection of food and non-food items. The Company offers online ordering of its products for pickup at its stores. Substantially all of the Company s stores are located within 280 miles of the Company s warehouse and distribution facilities, near Asheville, North Carolina. The Company operates 1.65 million square feet of warehouse and distribution facilities. These facilities supply the Company s supermarkets with approximately 57 of the goods the Company sells. The remaining 43 is purchased from third parties and is generally delivered directly to the stores. The close proximity of the Company s purchasing and distribution operations to its stores facilitates the timely distribution of consistently high quality perishable and non-perishable items. To further ensure product quality, the Company also owns and operates a milk processing and packaging plant that supplies approximately 72 of the milk products sold by the Company s supermarkets as well as a variety of organic milk, fruit juices and bottled water products. In addition, the milk processing and packaging plant sells approximately 81 of its products to other retailers, food service distributors and grocery warehouses in 17 states, which provides the Company with an additional source of revenue. The Company owns 167 of its supermarkets, either in free-standing stores or as the anchor tenant in an owned shopping center. The Company also owns 29 undeveloped sites suitable for a free-standing store or development by the Company or a third party. The Company s owned real estate is generally located in the same geographic region as its supermarkets. As of September 30, 2023, Mr. Robert P. Ingle II, our Chairman, beneficially owned approximately 72.2 of the combined voting power and 22.9 of the total number of shares of the Company s outstanding Class A and Class B Common Stock (in each case including stock held by the Company s Investment/Profit Sharing Plan and Trust of which Mr. Ingle II serves as one of the trustees). Beneficial ownership is calculated in accordance with Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Company became publicly traded in September 1987. The Company s Class A Common Stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol IMKTA. The Company s Class B Common Stock is not publicly listed or traded.

Information about the Company s operations is as follows (for information regarding the Company s industry segments, see Note 11, Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K): Fiscal Year Ended September (dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Revenues from unaffiliated customers: Grocery 2,062.4 1,940.4 1,762.9 Non-foods 1,326.9 1,204.5 1,136.3 Perishables 1,482.1 1,445.0 1,349.1 Fuel 792.5 885.8 583.7 Total retail 5,663.9 96.1 5,475.7 96.4 4,832.0 96.9 Other 228.9 3.9 203.1 3.6 156.0 3.1 5,892.8 100.0 5,678.8 100.0 4,988.0 100.0 Income from operations: Retail 263.2 90.0 353.0 93.7 327.6 93.6 Other 29.1 10.0 23.9 6.3 22.5 6.4 292.3 100.0 376.9 100.0 350.1 100.0 Other income, net 8.3 5.9 2.9 Interest expense 22.1 21.5 24.3 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 1.1 Income before income taxes 278.5 361.3 327.6 
 The Grocery category includes grocery, dairy and frozen foods. The Non-foods category includes alcoholic beverages, tobacco, pharmacy, and health/beauty/cosmetic products. The Perishables category includes meat, produce, deli and bakery. The Other category consists of fluid dairy operations and shopping center rentals. Supermarket Operations At September 30, 2023, the Company operated 189 supermarkets under the name Ingles, and nine supermarkets under the name Sav-Mor with locations in western North Carolina, western South Carolina, northern Georgia, eastern Tennessee, southwestern Virginia and northeastern Alabama. The Sav-Mor store concept accommodates smaller shopping areas and carries dry groceries, dairy, fresh meat and produce, all of which are displayed in a modern, readily accessible environment. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the Company s supermarket operations. Number of Supermarkets Percentage of Total at Fiscal Net Sales for Fiscal Year Ended September Year Ended September 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021 North Carolina 75 75 75 41 41 41 South Carolina 35 35 35 19 19 19 Georgia 65 65 65 32 32 32 Tennessee 21 21 21 8 8 8 Virginia 1 1 1 Alabama 1 1 1 198 198 198 100 100 100 
 The Company believes that today s supermarket customers focus on convenience, quality and value in an attractive store environment. As a result, the Company s shopping experience combines a high level of customer service, convenience-oriented quality product offerings and low overall pricing. The Company s modern stores provide products and services such as home meal replacement items, delicatessens, bakeries, floral departments, greeting cards and broad selections of local organic, beverage and health-related items. At September 30, 2023, the Company operated 114 pharmacies and 108 fuel stations, in each case at the Company s grocery store locations. The Company plans to continue to incorporate these departments in substantially all future new and remodeled stores. The Company trains its associates to provide friendly service and to actively address the needs of customers. These associates reinforce the Company s distinctive service-oriented image.

Selected statistics on the Company s supermarket operations are presented below: Fiscal Year Ended September 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Weighted Average Sales Per Store (000 s) (1) 28,565 27,622 23,926 22,215 20,189 Total Square Feet at End of Year (000 s) 11,403 11,342 11,342 11,256 11,247 Average Total Square Feet per Store 57,589 57,281 57,281 57,138 56,806 Average Square Feet of Selling Space per Store (2) 40,313 40,097 40,097 39,997 39,765 Weighted Average Sales per Square Foot of Selling Space (1) (2) 709 689 609 568 516 
 (1) Weighted average sales per store include the effects of increases in square footage due to the opening of replacement stores and the expansion of stores through remodeling during the periods indicated, and fuel sales. (2) Selling space is estimated to be 70 of total interior store square footage. Merchandising The Company s merchandising strategy is designed to create a comprehensive and satisfying shopping experience that blends value and customer service with variety, quality and convenience. Management believes that this strategy fosters a loyal customer base by establishing a reputation for providing high quality products and a variety of specialty departments. The Company s stores carry a broad selection of quality meats, produce and other perishables. The Company offers a wide variety of fresh and non-perishable organic products, including organic milk produced by the Company s fluid dairy plant. The Company s market areas contain numerous providers of quality local products, which is in line with current customer preferences for goods produced where they live. Management believes that customers perceive supermarkets offering a broad array of products and time-saving services as part of a solution to today s lifestyle demands. Accordingly, a principal component of the Company s merchandising strategy is to design stores that enhance the shopping experience. The Company operates fuel stations at 108 of its store locations. A selection of prepared foods and home meal replacements are featured throughout Ingles deli, bakery, produce and meat departments to provide customers with easy meal alternatives that they can eat at home or in the store. Many stores offer daily selections of home meal replacement items, such as rotisserie chicken and pork, international foods, fried chicken and other entrees, sandwiches, pre-packaged salads, sushi, cut fruit and prepared fresh vegetables. The bakery offers an expanded selection of baked goods and self-service options. Ingles bakes most of its items on site, including bread baked daily, cakes made to order in various sizes, donuts and other pastries. The deli offers salad, chicken wing and olive bars, an expanded offering of cheeses, gourmet items and home meal replacement items. The Company also provides its customers with an expanded selection of frozen food items (including organics) to meet the increasing demands of its customers. The Ingles Curbside service allows customers to order any product in the Company s stores online. The order is picked by store associates and loaded into the customer s vehicle. This service is currently offered at 129 of the Company s stores, with additional stores expected to be added each month. Ingles private labels cover a broad range of products throughout the store, such as milk, bread, organic products, soft drinks and canned goods. Ingles believes that private label sales help promote customer loyalty and provide a value-priced alternative to national brands. The Company seeks to maintain a reputation for providing friendly service, quality merchandise and customer value and for its commitment to locally-sourced products and community involvement. The Company employs various advertising and promotional strategies to reinforce the quality and value of its products. The Company promotes these attributes using traditional advertising vehicles including radio, television, direct mail and newspapers, as well as electronic and social media. The Ingles Advantage Card is designed to foster customer loyalty by providing information to better understand the Company s customers shopping patterns. The Ingles Advantage Card provides customers with special discounts throughout the Company s stores and fuel stations. Purchasing and Distribution The Company currently supplies approximately 57 of its supermarkets inventory requirements from its modern warehouse and distribution facilities. The Company has 1.65 million square feet of office, warehouse and distribution facilities at its headquarters near Asheville, North Carolina. The Company believes that its warehouse and distribution facilities contain sufficient capacity for the continued expansion of its store base for the foreseeable future. The Company s centrally managed purchasing and distribution operations provide several advantages, including the ability to negotiate and reduce the cost of merchandise, decrease overhead costs and better manage its inventory at both the warehouse and store level. From time to time, the Company engages in advance purchasing on high-turnover inventory items to take advantage of special prices offered by manufacturers for limited periods, or to ensure adequate product supply during tight distribution market conditions.

The remaining 43 of the Company s inventory requirements, primarily beverages, pharmacy, fuel, bread and snack foods, are supplied directly to the Company s supermarkets by local distributors and manufacturers. Goods from the warehouse and distribution facilities and the milk processing and packaging plant are distributed to the Company s stores by a fleet of 183 tractors and 864 trailers that the Company owns, operates and maintains. The Company invests on an ongoing basis in the maintenance, upgrade and replacement of its tractor and trailer fleet. The Company also operates truck servicing and fuel storage facilities at its warehouse and distribution facilities. The Company reduces its overall distribution costs by capitalizing on back-haul opportunities (contracting with third parties to transport their merchandise on our trucks that would otherwise be empty). The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in March 2020, have eased considerably over the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, but the earlier portion of the pandemic substantially impacted supermarket operations, and some effects have continued through the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company implemented several enhanced cleaning and social distancing protocols designed to keep our customers and our associates safe and continued to monitor and update its protocols as the pandemic evolved. Since March 2020, the Company s stores have experienced increased customer traffic and occasional product shortages due to supply chain issues. The currently tight labor market has impacted the Company s ability to attract and retain qualified store personnel, but these impacts have not materially affected our operations. The economy has continued to recover from the effects of the pandemic, which has included inflation not seen in decades. Inflation impacts product costs, labor costs and the cost of other goods used by the Company, which could negatively impact our results of Operations. While the COVID-19 pandemic was officially declared to have ended in May 2023, at the present time, we cannot predict how long and to what extent the ongoing effects of the pandemic and inflation will impact our sales and financial performance. The Company receives product recall information from various subscription, government and vendor sources. Upon receipt of recall information, the Company immediately contacts each of its stores to have the recalled product removed from the shelves and disposed of as instructed. The Company may also use social media to communicate product recall information to the public. The Company has a policy of refunding and/or replacing any goods returned by customers. The details of this policy are posted inside each of the Company s stores. Store Development, Expansion and Remodeling The Company believes that the appearance and design of its stores are integral components of its customers shopping experience and aims to develop one of the most modern supermarket chains in the industry. The ongoing modernization of the Company s store base involves (i) the construction of new stores with continuously updated designs, and (ii) the replacement, remodeling or expansion of existing stores. The Company s goal is to maintain clean, well-lit stores with attractive architectural and display features that enhance the image of its stores as catering to the changing lifestyle needs of quality-conscious consumers who demand increasingly diverse product offerings. The construction of new stores by independent contractors is closely monitored and controlled by the Company. During fiscal year 2023, the Company slowed some of its new store and remodeling plans due to inflation and supply chain issues in building materials and equipment, as well as due to the tight labor market conditions for construction labor. As described above, we cannot currently predict how long these conditions will persist, but the Company has continued to build and remodel stores albeit at what management believes will be a temporarily slower pace. The Company renovates and remodels stores in order to increase customer traffic and sales, respond to existing customer demand, compete effectively against new stores opened by competitors and support its quality image merchandising strategy. The Company decides to complete a remodel of an existing store based on its evaluation of the competitive landscape of the local marketplace. A remodel or expansion provides the quality of facilities and product offerings identical to that of a new store, capitalizing upon the existing customer base. The Company retains the existing customer base by keeping the store in operation during the entire remodeling process. The Company may elect to relocate, rather than remodel, certain stores where relocation provides a more convenient location for its customers. The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years indicated, the Company s new store development and store remodeling activities and the effect this program has had on the average size of its stores: 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Number of Stores: Opened 2 1 Closed 1 1 3 Stores open at end of period 198 198 198 197 198 Size of Stores: Less than 42,000 sq. ft. 45 46 46 46 48 42,000 up to 51,999 sq. ft. 22 22 22 22 22 52,000 up to 61,999 sq. ft. 47 47 47 47 47 At least 62,000 sq. ft. 84 83 83 82 81 Average store size (sq. ft.) 57,589 57,281 57,281 57,138 56,806

The Company s ability to open new stores is subject to many factors, including the acquisition of satisfactory sites, as well as zoning limitations and other government regulations. In addition, the Company continually reviews its expansion, remodeling and replacement plans, which are subject to change. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section included in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding the Company s capital expenditures. Competition The supermarket industry is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins. The degree of competition the Company s stores encounter varies by location, primarily based on the size of the community in which the store is located and its proximity to other communities. The Company s principal competitors are, in alphabetical order, Aldi, Inc., Earth Fare, Inc, Food City (K-VA-T Food Stores, Inc.), Food Lion (Koninlijke Ahold Delhaize America N.V.), The Fresh Market, Inc., Harris Teeter (owned by The Kroger Co.), The Kroger Co., Lidl (Lidl Stiftung Co. KG), Publix Super Markets, Inc., Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc., Target Corporation, Whole Foods Market, and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Increasingly over the last few years, competition for consumers food dollars has intensified due to the addition of, or increase in, food sections by many types of retailers (physical and online) and by restaurants. Supermarket chains generally compete based on location, quality of products, service, price, convenience, product variety, online ordering/delivery capabilities, and store condition. The Company believes its competitive advantages include convenient locations, the quality of service it provides its customers, competitive pricing, product variety, quality and a pleasant shopping environment, which is enhanced by its ongoing modernization program. By concentrating its operations within a relatively small geographic region, the Company is also positioned to monitor its markets and the needs of its customers more carefully within those markets. The Company s senior executives live and work in the Company s operating region, thereby allowing management to quickly identify changes in needs and customer preference. Because of the Company s size, store managers have direct access to senior corporate management and can receive quick decisions regarding requested changes in operations. The Company can then move quickly to adjust its business in response to changes in the market and customer needs. The Company s management monitors competitive activity and regularly reviews and periodically adjusts the Company s marketing and business strategies as management deems appropriate considering existing conditions in the Company s region. The Company s ability to remain competitive in its changing markets will depend in part on its ability to pursue its expansion and renovation programs and its response to remodeling and new store openings by its competitors. Seasonality Sales in the grocery segment of the Company s business are subject to slight seasonal variances due to holiday related sales and sales during portions of the year in which customers return to seasonal homes. Sales are traditionally higher in the Company s first fiscal quarter due to the inclusion of sales related to Thanksgiving and Christmas. The Company s second fiscal quarter traditionally has the lowest sales of the year, unless Easter falls in that quarter. In the third and fourth quarters, sales are affected by the return of customers to seasonal homes in the Company s market area. The Company s fluid dairy operations have a slight seasonal variation to the extent of its sales into the grocery industry. The Company s real estate operations are not subject to seasonal variations. Human Capital At September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 26,420 associates, of which 93 were supermarket personnel. Approximately 56 of supermarket personnel work on a part-time basis. Management considers labor relations to be good. The Company values its associates and believes that associate loyalty and enthusiasm are key elements of its operating performance. The Company has responded to the tight labor market by increasing resources devoted to associate recruitment and retention, and by expanding the ways in which it markets itself to prospective associates; however, competition for labor has become more intense, resulting in higher costs to attract and retain associates. The Company has various programs to ensure adequate store staffing levels at any given time during the week. Store managers are given tools to assist in scheduling and levels of staffing. We provide flexible scheduling to accommodate the needs of our full and part-time associates, and we also provide incentives for associates based on the achievement of operating and safety goals. The Company has made technology investments to allow efficient remote work environments for associates that do not work in our stores or distribution center. Trademarks and Licenses The Company employs various trademarks and service marks in its business, the most important of which are its own Laura Lynn and Harvest Farms private label trademarks, The Ingles Advantage service mark, and the Ingles service mark. These service

marks and the trademarks are federally registered in the United States pursuant to applicable intellectual property laws and are the property of Ingles. The Company believes it has all material licenses and permits necessary to conduct its business. The current expiration dates for significant trade and service marks are as follows: Ingles December 9, 2025; Laura Lynn March 13, 2024; Harvest Farms Organic August 5, 2024; and The Ingles Advantage August 30, 2025. Each registration may be renewed for an additional ten-year term prior to its expiration. The Company intends to timely file all renewals. Each of the Company s trademark license agreements has a one year term which, with respect to one license, is automatically renewed annually, unless the owner of the trademark provides notice of termination prior to the expiration date and, with respect to the other licenses, are renewed periodically by letter from the licensor. Environmental Matters Under applicable environmental laws, the Company may be responsible for remediation of environmental conditions and may be subject to associated liabilities relating to its stores and other buildings and the land on which such stores and other buildings are situated (including responsibility and liability related to its operation of its gas stations and the storage of fuel in underground storage tanks), regardless of whether the Company leases or owns the stores, other buildings or land in question and regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by the Company or by a prior owner or tenant. The presence of contamination from hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to properly remediate such contaminated property, may adversely affect the Company s ability to sell or rent such real property or to borrow using such real property as collateral. The Company typically conducts an environmental review prior to acquiring or leasing new stores, other buildings or raw land. Federal, state and local governments could enact laws or regulations concerning environmental matters that affect the Company s operations or facilities or increase the cost of producing or distributing the Company s products. The Company believes that it currently conducts its operations, and in the past has conducted its operations, in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. The Company, however, cannot predict the environmental liabilities that may result from legislation or regulations adopted in the future, the effect of which could be retroactive. Nor can the Company predict how existing or future laws and regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist at its facilities or at other properties where the Company or its predecessors have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. The Company strives to employ sound environmental operating policies, including recycling packaging, recycling wooden pallets, and re-circulating some water used in its car washes. The Company offers reusable shopping bags to its customers and will pack groceries in bags brought in by its customers. The Company s store modernization plans include energy efficient lighting and refrigeration equipment. Government Regulation The Company is subject to regulation by a variety of governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state and local agencies. The Company s stores are also subject to local laws regarding zoning, land use and the sale of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. The Company believes that its locations are in material compliance with such laws and regulations. The Company is not aware of any proposed regulations that would materially affect the Company s business, financial condition, or results of operations. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Below is a series of risk factors that may materially affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operation. The Company operates in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. The following information should be read together with other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . Risks Related to Our Business and Industry The Company s warehouse and distribution center and milk processing and packaging plant, as well as all of the Company s stores, are concentrated in the Southeastern United States, which makes it vulnerable to economic downturns, natural disasters and other adverse conditions or other catastrophic events in this region. The Company operates in the southeastern United States, and its performance is therefore heavily influenced by economic developments in the Southeast region. The Company s headquarters, warehouse and distribution center and milk processing and packaging plant are located in North Carolina and all of the Company s stores are located in the Southeast region. As a result, the Company s business may be more susceptible to regional factors than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors. These factors include, among others, changes in the economy, weather conditions, demographics and population.

Various aspects of the Company s business are subject to federal, state and local laws and various operating regulations. The Company s compliance with these regulations may require additional capital expenditures and could adversely affect the Company s ability to conduct the Company s business as planned. The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning, land use, workplace safety, public health, community right-to-know, beer and wine sales, country of origin labeling of food products, pharmaceutical sales and fuel station operations. Furthermore, the Company s business is regulated by a variety of governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Employers are also subject to laws governing their relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, insurance coverage, disabled access, and work permit requirements. Recent and proposed regulation has had or may have a future impact on the cost of insurance benefits for associates and on the cost of processing debit and credit card transactions. Compliance with, or changes in, these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of the Company s supermarkets and could otherwise adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company is affected by certain operating costs which could increase or fluctuate considerably. The Company depends on qualified associates to operate the Company s stores. A shortage of qualified associates could require the Company to enhance the Company s wage and benefit package in order to better compete for and retain qualified associates, and the Company may not be able to recover these increased labor costs through price increases charged to customers, which could significantly increase the Company s operating costs. The Company is self-insured for workers compensation, general liability and group medical and dental benefits. Risks and uncertainties are associated with self-insurance; however, the Company has limited its exposure by maintaining excess liability coverage. Self-insurance liabilities are established based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The estimates are based on data provided by the respective claims administrators and analyses performed by actuaries engaged by the Company. These estimates can fluctuate if historical trends are not predictive of the future. The majority of the Company s properties are self-insured for casualty losses and business interruption; however, liability coverage is maintained. Energy and utility costs have been volatile in recent years. The Company attempts to increase its energy efficiency during store construction and remodeling using energy-saving equipment and construction. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unprecedented global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that began in the first quarter of 2020 has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide, including workforces, liquidity, capital markets, consumer behavior, supply chains and macroeconomic conditions. While the COVID-19 pandemic was officially declared to have ended in May 2023,and while the direct effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business have significantly lessened during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, some effects have continued through the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and we may continue to be impacted by the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences and variants of COVID-19 or outbreaks of any new viruses or contagions. These impacts may include difficulties and delays in sourcing, transporting and stocking products: inabilities to staff our stores and warehouse and distribution facilities at adequate levels to conduct our operations, resulting in store closures or operating hour reductions; and incurring significant costs in support of our front-line store team members for enhanced benefits, safety measures and government-mandated wage increases. The extent to which a future COVID-19 outbreak could impact our business and operating results in the future depends on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and variants of the virus and the actions to contain or treat their impact, as well as the impact of any new federal, state and local mandates or other regulations associated with COVID-19. The Company is subject to risks related to information systems and data security. The Company s business is dependent on information technology systems. These complex systems are an important part of ongoing operations. If the Company were to experience disruption in these systems, did not maintain existing systems properly, or did not implement new systems appropriately, operations could suffer. The Company is currently undergoing a systematic program to enhance its information technology abilities. The Company has implemented procedures to protect its information technology systems and data necessary to conduct ongoing operations. The Company cannot, however, be certain that all these systems and data are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. Compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards, including protection of customer debit and credit card information, may result in higher investments in technology and changes to operational processes. In recent years, more industry transactions have been online for ordering and fulfillment. This trend places a higher reliance on effective and efficient information systems.

The Company is affected by the availability and wholesale price of fuel and retail fuel prices, all of which can fluctuate quickly and considerably. The Company operates fuel stations at 108 of its store locations. While the Company obtains gasoline and diesel fuel from several different suppliers, long-term disruption in the availability and wholesale price of fuel for resale could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Fluctuating fuel costs could adversely affect the Company s operating costs which depend on fuel for the Company s fleet of tractors and trailers which distribute goods from the Company s distribution facility and for the Company s fluid dairy operations. Furthermore, fluctuating fuel costs could have an adverse effect on the Company s total fuel sales (both in terms of dollars and gallons sold), the profitability of fuel sales, and the Company s plans to develop additional fuel centers. Also, retail gas price volatility could diminish customer usage of fueling centers and, thus, adversely affect customer traffic at the Company s stores. The Company s industry is highly competitive. If the Company is unable to compete effectively, the Company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. The supermarket industry is highly competitive and continues to be characterized by intense price competition, increasing fragmentation of retail formats, entry of non-traditional competitors (both physical and online) and market consolidation. Furthermore, some of the Company s competitors have greater financial resources and could use these financial resources to take measures, such as altering product mix, reducing prices, home/in-store fulfillment, or online ordering which could adversely affect the Company s competitive position. Disruptions in the efficient distribution of food products to the Company s warehouse and stores may adversely affect the Company s business. The Company s business could be adversely affected by disruptions in the efficient distribution of food products to the Company s warehouse and stores. Such disruptions could be caused by, among other things, adverse weather conditions, fuel availability, shortage of truck drivers, food contamination recalls and civil unrest in foreign countries in which the Company s suppliers do business. The Company s operations are subject to economic conditions that impact consumer spending. The Company s results of operations are sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Future economic conditions such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, energy and fuel costs and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits. A general reduction in the level of consumer spending or the Company s inability to respond to shifting consumer attitudes regarding products, store location and other factors could adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Inflation could impact the Company s operations. The following table from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics lists annualized changes in the Consumer Price Index that could have an effect on the Company s operations. One of the Company s significant costs is labor, which increases with general inflation. Inflation or deflation in energy costs affects the Company s fuel sales, distribution expenses and plastic supply costs. During fiscal year 2023, inflation reached its highest level in a number of years, impacting food costs, transportation costs, and labor costs.

In addition to the plant, the 20-acre property includes truck cleaning and fuel storage facilities. Certain long-term debt of the Company is secured by the owned properties. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Leased Properties The Company operates supermarkets at 31 locations leased from various unaffiliated third parties. The Company has six owned store buildings that are on ground leases. The Company leases one other former supermarket location, which is subleased to a third party. The majority of these leases require the Company to pay property taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and certain other expenses incidental to occupation of the premises. In addition to base rent, most leases contain provisions that require the Company to pay additional percentage rent (ranging from 0.75 to 1.50 if sales exceed a specified amount. Rental rates generally range from 3.00 to 7.77 per square foot. During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company paid cash supermarket rent of 9.4 million, 10.0 million and 10.3 million, respectively. These amounts exclude property taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs, other expenses, and non-cash rent adjustments. The following table summarizes lease expiration dates as of September 30, 2023, with respect to the initial and any renewal option terms of leased supermarkets properties: Year of Expiration Number of (Including Renewal Terms) Leases Expiring 2023-2034 5 2035-2049 1 2050 or after 26 
 Management believes that the long-term rent stability provided by these leases is a valuable asset of the Company.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business are pending against the Company. In the opinion of management, the ultimate liability, if any, from all pending legal proceedings and claims would not materially affect the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The foregoing stock performance information, including the graph, shall not be deemed to be soliciting material or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Ingles is a leading supermarket chain in the Southeast United States and operates a total of 198 supermarkets in North Carolina (75), Georgia (65), South Carolina (35), Tennessee (21), Virginia (1) and Alabama (1). Ingles supermarkets offer customers a wide variety of nationally advertised food products, including grocery, meat and dairy products, produce, frozen foods and other perishables and non-food products. Non-food products include fuel centers, pharmacies, health/beauty/cosmetic products and general merchandise. The Company offers quality private label items in most of its departments. In addition, the Company focuses on selling products to its customers through the development of certified organic products, bakery departments and prepared foods including delicatessen sections. As of September 30, 2023, the Company operated 114 in-store pharmacies and 108 fuel stations. Ingles also operates a fluid dairy and earns shopping center rentals. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the presentation of Ingles financial condition and results of operations, and require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are based on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management estimates, by their nature, involve judgments regarding future uncertainties, and actual results may therefore differ materially from these estimates. Self-Insurance The Company is self-insured for workers compensation, general liability, and group medical and dental benefits. Risks and uncertainties are associated with self-insurance; however, the Company has limited its exposure by maintaining excess liability coverage of 1,000,000 per occurrence for workers compensation and for general liability, and 500,000 per covered person for medical care benefits for a policy year. Self-insurance liabilities are established based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The estimates are based on data provided by the respective claims administrators which is then applied to appropriate actuarial methods. These estimates can fluctuate if historical trends are not predictive of the future. The majority of the Company s properties are self-insured for casualty losses and business interruption; however, liability coverage is maintained. The Company s self-insurance reserves totaled 32.9 million and 31.0 million for employee group insurance, workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance at September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. These amounts were inclusive of expected recoveries from excess cost insurance or other sources that are recorded as receivables of 4.3 million at September 30, 2023 and 4.0 million at September 24, 2022. Asset Impairments The Company accounts for the impairment of long-lived assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification FASB ASC Topic 360. Asset groups are primarily comprised of our individual store and shopping center properties. For assets to be held and used, the Company tests for impairment using undiscounted cash flows and calculates the amount of impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets held for sale, impairment is recognized based on the excess of remaining book value over expected recovery value. The recovery value is the fair value as determined by independent quotes or expected sales prices developed by internal associates, net of costs to sell. Estimates of future cash flows and expected sales prices are judgments based upon the Company s experience and knowledge of local operations and cash flows that are projected for several years into the future. These estimates can fluctuate significantly due to changes in real estate market conditions, the economic environment, capital 

 16 

spending decisions and inflation. The Company monitors the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether any indicators of impairment have occurred. Vendor Allowances The Company receives funds for a variety of merchandising activities from the many vendors whose products the Company buys for resale in its stores. These incentives and allowances are primarily composed of volume or purchase based incentives, advertising allowances, slotting fees, and promotional discounts. The purpose of these incentives and allowances is generally to help defray the costs incurred by the Company for stocking, advertising, promoting and selling the applicable vendor s products. These allowances generally relate to short term arrangements with vendors, often relating to a period of one month or less and are negotiated on a purchase-by-purchase or transaction-by-transaction basis. Whenever practical, vendor discounts and allowances that relate to buying and merchandising activities are recorded as a reduction of item cost in inventory and recognized in merchandise costs when the item is sold. Due to the use of the retail method for store inventory and the nature of certain allowances, it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory. In those instances, the allowances are applied as a reduction of merchandise costs using a rational and systematic methodology, which results in the recognition of these incentives when the inventory related to the vendor consideration received is sold. Vendor allowances applied as a reduction of merchandise costs totaled 128.9 million, 110.6 million and 116.3 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, September 24, 2022, and September 25, 2021, respectively. Vendor advertising allowances that represent a reimbursement of specific identifiable incremental costs of advertising the vendor s specific products are recorded as a reduction to the related expense in the period that the related expense is incurred. Vendor advertising allowances recorded as a reduction of advertising expense totaled 8.5 million, 7.1 million, and 8.1 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, September 24, 2022, and September 25, 2021, respectively. If vendor advertising allowances were substantially reduced or eliminated, the Company would likely consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of the Company s product advertising, which could increase or decrease the Company s expenditures. Similarly, the Company is not able to assess the impact of vendor advertising allowances on creating additional revenue, as such allowances do not directly generate revenue for the Company s stores. Results of Operations Fiscal Year Ingles operates on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in September. The consolidated statements of income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 had 53 weeks. The consolidated statements of income for fiscal years September 24, 2022, and September 25, 2021 each consisted of 52 weeks of operations. Comparable Store Sales Comparable store sales are defined as sales by grocery stores in operation for five full fiscal quarters. The Company has an ongoing renovation and expansion plan to modernize the appearance and layout of its existing stores. Sales from replacement stores, major remodels and the addition of fuel stations to existing stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation from the date of completion of the replacement, remodel or addition. A replacement store is a newly opened store that replaces an existing nearby store that is closed. A major remodel entails substantial remodeling of an existing store and may include additional retail square footage. Comparable store sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, included 198 stores and, for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022, comparable store sales included 197 stores. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, selected financial information as a percentage of net sales. Fiscal Year Ended September 2023 2022 2021 Net sales 100.0 100.0 100.0 Gross profit 23.8 24.9 26.1 Operating and administrative expenses 18.9 18.3 19.3 Gain from sale or disposal of assets 0.1 0.2 Income from operations 5.0 6.6 7.0 Other income, net 0.2 0.1 Interest expense 0.4 0.4 0.5 Income before income taxes 4.8 6.4 6.6 Income tax expense 1.2 1.6 1.6 Net income 3.6 4.8 5.0

Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended September 24, 2022 Net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 was 210.8 million, compared with net income of 272.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. Comparisons of fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2022 are affected by the difference in the number of weeks in each year. Fiscal year 2023 had 53 weeks and fiscal year 2022 had 52 weeks. Net income as a percentage of sales was 3.6 for fiscal year 2023 compared with 4.8 for fiscal year 2022. Inflation in the cost of goods and increases in operating expenses due to the competition in the labor market contributed to this decrease. Net Sales . Net sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 totaled 5.89 billion, compared with 5.68 billion for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, such as 2023, management analyzes comparable stores sales for the 53 weeks of the year with the corresponding 52 calendar weeks of the previous year plus one additional week. On this basis, retail grocery comparable store sales excluding fuel increased 4.0 for fiscal 2023 compared with 2022. The number of transactions (excluding fuel) increased 2.9 while the average transaction size (excluding fuel) increased by 0.9 . Comparing fiscal 2023 with 2022, fuel gallons sold decreased 0.4 and per gallon fuel prices decreased 10.2 . Sales by product category for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows: Fiscal Year Ended September (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Grocery 2,062,416 1,940,414 Non-foods 1,326,907 1,204,443 Perishables 1,482,089 1,445,042 Fuel 792,524 885,801 Total retail grocery 5,663,936 5,475,700

Retail grocery gross profit as a percentage of total sales (excluding fuel) decreased 182 basis points in fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal year 2022. The gross margin decrease was primarily due to inflation and supply chain factors that impacted prices and mix of products sold. In addition to the direct product cost, the cost of goods sold line item for the grocery segment includes inbound freight charges, which generally increased in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022, and increased costs related to the Company s distribution network, including the impact of higher diesel prices.

 Salaries and wages increased due to increased competition in the labor market in the Company s market area, in addition to the extra week of expense for the 53 rd week. Repairs and maintenance increased due to higher refrigerant costs and the cost of other supply items, as well as increased wear and tear on equipment to accommodate sales volume, in addition to the extra week of expense for the 53 rd week. Advertising and promotion costs decreased due to absorbing some of the activity in-house and moving towards lower-cost types of advertising.

Fiscal Year Ended September 24, 2022 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended September 25, 2021 See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in Ingles Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 24, 2022, filed with the SEC on November 23, 2022, for a discussion of the year ended September 24, 2022 as compared to September 25, 2021. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Expenditures The Company believes that a key to its ability to continue to increase sales and develop a loyal customer base is providing conveniently located, clean and modern stores which provide customers with good service and an increasingly diverse selection of competitively priced products. As such, the Company has invested and plans to continue to invest significant amounts of capital toward the modernization of its store base. The Company s modernization program includes the opening of new stores, the completion of major remodels and expansion of selected existing stores, and the relocation of selected existing stores to larger, more convenient locations. Capital expenditures totaled 173.6 million and 119.6 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, with the increase driven primarily by the purchase of new sites and land parcels. Major capital expenditures included the following: 2023 2022 New stores 0 0 Store sites/land parcels purchased 15 6 New fuel stations added 1 0 

19 

Capital expenditures include upgrading and replacing store equipment, technology investments, those related to the Company s distribution operation and its milk processing plant, and expenditures for stores to open in subsequent fiscal years. Ingles capital expenditure plans for fiscal year 2024 include investments of approximately 120 to 170 million. The Company currently plans to dedicate the majority of its fiscal 2024 capital expenditures to continued improvement of its store base, as well as technology improvements, upgrading and replacing existing store, warehouse and transportation equipment and improvements to the Company s milk processing plant. The Company currently expects that its net annual capital expenditures will be in the range of approximately 100 to 160 million going forward in order to maintain a modern store base. Among other things, planned expenditures for any given future fiscal year will be affected by the availability of financing, which can affect both the number of projects pursued at any given time and the cost of those projects. The number of projects may also fluctuate due to the varying costs of the types of projects pursued including new stores, major store remodels/expansions, and build-out of tenant space under the long-term leases. The Company makes decisions on the allocation of capital expenditure dollars based on many factors including the competitive environment, other Company capital initiatives and its financial condition. In general, the Company finances its capital expenditures to the extent possible from cash on hand and cash flow from operations. Additional financing sources for capital expenditures could include borrowings under the Company s 150 million of committed line of credit (described below), other borrowings that could be collateralized by unencumbered real property and equipment with a net book value of approximately 1.2 billion, and the public debt or equity markets. The Company has used each of these to finance past capital expenditures and expects to have them available in the future. The Company does not generally enter into commitments for capital expenditures other than on a store-by-store basis at the time it begins construction on a new store or begins a major or minor remodeling project. Construction commitments at September 30, 2023 totaled 3.0 million. Liquidity The Company generated 266.4 million of cash from operations in fiscal 2023 compared with 339.5 million for fiscal year 2022. The decrease resulted primarily from a 61.9 million decrease in net income for fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal 2022. Cash used by investing activities for fiscal year 2023 totaled 170.1 million compared with 112.0 million for fiscal year 2022. The Company s most significant investing activity is capital expenditures, which increased in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022. The Company s cash used by net financing activities totaled 35.0 million and 30.6 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The U.S. Dollar LIBOR panel ceased following June 30, 2023, and the Company s debt agreements and interest rate swaps that utilized LIBOR discontinued the use of LIBOR and adopted the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). In June 2021, the Company issued at par 350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00 senior notes due 2031 (the 2031 Notes and used a portion of the proceeds to redeem the remaining outstanding 295.0 million principal amount of the Company s 5.75 senior notes due. The Company has a 150.0 million unsecured senior line of credit (the Line that matures in June 2026. The Line provides the Company with various interest rate options based on the prime rate, the Federal Funds Rate, or SOFR. The Line allows the Company to issue up to 10.0 million in letters of credit, of which none were issued at September 30, 2023. The Company is not required to maintain compensating balances in connection with the Line. At September 30, 2023, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Line. In December 2010, the Company completed the funding of 99.7 million of Recovery Zone Facility Bonds (the Bonds for the construction of new warehouse and distribution space adjacent to its existing space in Buncombe County, North Carolina (the Project ). The final maturity date of the Bonds is January 1, 2036. Under a Continuing Covenant and Collateral Agency Agreement (the Covenant Agreement between certain financial institutions and the Company, such financial institutions hold the Bonds until December 2029, subject to certain events. Mandatory redemption of the Bonds by the Company in the annual amount of 4.5 million began on January 1, 2014. The outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Bonds was 54.4 million at September 30, 2023. The Company may redeem the Bonds without penalty or premium at any time prior to December 17, 2029. In September 2017, the Company refinanced approximately 60 million of secured borrowing obligations with a SOFR-based amortizing floating rate loan secured by real estate, which matures in October 2027. The Company has an interest rate swap agreement for a current notional amount of 24.5 million at a fixed rate of 3.962 . Under this agreement, the Company pays monthly the fixed rate of 3.962 and receives the one-month SOFR plus 1.75 . The interest rate swap effectively hedges floating rate debt in the same

amount as the current notional amount of the interest swap. Both the floating rate debt and the interest rate swap have monthly principal amortization of 0.5 million and mature October 1, 2027. In December 2019, the Company closed a 155 million SOFR-based amortizing floating rate loan secured by real estate, which matures in January 2030. The Company has an interest rate swap agreement for a current notional amount of 124.6 million at a fixed rate of 2.998 . Under this agreement, the Company pays monthly the fixed rate of 2.998 and receives the one-month SOFR plus 1.60 . The interest rate swap effectively hedges floating rate debt in the same amount as the current notional amount of the interest swap. Both the floating rate debt and the interest rate swap have monthly principal amortization of 0.65 million and mature in fiscal year 2030. The fair market value of the interest rate swaps is measured quarterly with adjustments recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company s long-term debt agreements generally have cross-default provisions which could result in the acceleration of payments due under the Company s Line, Bonds and 2031 Notes indenture in the event of default under any one instrument. The Bonds and the Line contain provisions that under certain circumstances would permit the acceleration of the indebtedness under such instruments or would otherwise permit lending institutions to terminate or withdraw their respective extensions of credit to the Company. Included among the triggering factors permitting the termination or withdrawal of the Bonds and the Line to the Company are certain events of default, including both monetary and non-monetary defaults, the initiation of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, and the failure of the Company to meet certain financial covenants designated in its respective loan documents. As of September 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. Under the most restrictive of these covenants, the Company would have been permitted to incur approximately 1.8 billion of additional borrowings (including borrowings under the Line) as of September 30, 2023. The Company s principal sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flow from operations, borrowings under the Line and long-term debt financing. The Company believes, based on its current results of operations and financial condition, that its financial resources, including cash balances, the existing Line, short- and long-term financing expected to be available to it and internally generated funds, will be sufficient to meet planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future, including any debt service requirements of additional borrowings. However, there can be no assurance that any such sources of financing will be available to the Company when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. It is possible that, in the future, the Company s results of operations and financial condition will be different from that described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K based on a number of intangible factors. These factors may include, among others, resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic virus, increased competition, changing regional and national economic conditions, adverse climatic conditions affecting food production and delivery and changing demographics as well as the additional factors discussed above and elsewhere under Item 1A. Risk Factors. It is also possible, for such reasons, that the results of operations from the new, expanded, remodeled and/or replacement stores will not meet or exceed the results of operations from existing stores that are described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Quarterly Cash Dividends Since December 27, 1993, the Company has paid regular quarterly cash dividends of 0.165 per share on its Class A Common Stock and 0.15 per share on its Class B Common Stock for an annual rate of 0.66 and 0.60 per share, respectively. The Company expects to continue paying regular cash dividends on a quarterly basis. However, the Board of Directors periodically reconsiders the declaration of dividends. The Company pays these dividends at the discretion of the Board of Directors and the continuation of these payments, the amount of such dividends, and the form in which the dividends are paid (cash or stock) depends upon the results of operations, the financial condition of the Company and other factors which the Board of Directors deems relevant. Certain of the Company s long-term debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants requiring, among other things, minimum levels of net worth and maintenance of certain financial ratios. These covenants have the effect of restricting certain types of transactions, including the payment of cash dividends generally and in excess of current quarterly per share amounts. New Accounting Pronouncements For new accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Outlook and Trends in the Company s Markets The COVID-19 pandemic that began in March 2020 substantially impacted supermarket operations during fiscal years 2020, 2021 and 2022. While the effects of the pandemic on the Company have eased considerably over the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, some effects have continued through the year ended September 30, 2023, and we do not know how long and to what extent COVID-19 will impact our markets in fiscal year 2024.

The Company continually assesses and modifies its business model to meet the changing needs and expectations of its customers. In connection with this review, the Company assesses the trends present in the markets in which it competes. Generally, it is difficult to predict whether a trend will continue for a period of time and it is possible that new trends will develop which will affect an existing trend. The Company believes that the following trends are likely to continue for at least the next fiscal year: The supermarket industry will remain highly competitive and will be characterized by industry consolidation, fragmented food retail platforms, and continued competition from super centers and other non-supermarket operators. Traditional supermarket products will be acquired by customers in new and diverse ways, including online ordering, home delivery and pre-picked for customer pickup. Economic conditions will continue to affect customer behavior. Economic conditions may affect purchasing patterns with regard to meal replacement items, private label purchases, promotions and product variety. The Company and its customers will continue to become more environmentally aware, evidenced by the Company s increased recycled waste paper and pallets and customers increased usage of reusable shopping bags. Volatile petroleum costs will impact utility and distribution costs, plastic supplies cost and may change customer shopping and dining behavior. Retail fuel costs and retail prices will continue to be volatile, affecting the Company s fuel sales and gross margin. The Company plans to continue to focus on balancing sales growth and gross margin maintenance (excluding the effect of fuel sales) and will carefully monitor its product mix and customer trends. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities, which include borrowings under the Line, real estate and equipment financing, and the bonds. The Line, along with cash flow from operations, is used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations. The 2031 Notes bear a fixed rate of interest and do not expose us to interest rate risk. The nature and amount of the Company s debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. The definitive extent of the Company s interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements, but the Company does not believe such risk is material. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average rates by year of maturity for the Company s debt obligations at September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively (in thousands): September 30, 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Fair Value Line of credit Average variable interest rate Long-term debt, variable interest rate (1)(2) 13,750 13,750 13,750 13,750 8,237 87,833 151,070 151,070 Average interest rate 6.99 6.99 6.99 6.99 6.94 6.93 6.95 Recovery Zone Bonds, variable interest rate 4,530 4,530 4,530 4,530 4,530 31,790 54,440 54,440 Average year-end interest rate 5.20 5.20 5.20 5.20 5.20 5.20 5.20 Senior Notes, fixed interest rate 350,000 350,000 287,875 Average interest rate 4.00 4.00 September 24, 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Fair Value Line of credit Average variable interest rate Long-term debt, variable interest rate (1)(2) 13,750 13,750 13,750 13,750 13,750 96,083 164,833 164,833 Average year-end interest rate (1)(2) 4.13 4.13 4.13 4.13 4.13 4.06 4.09 Long-term debt, fixed interest rate 91 95 4,002 4,188 4,185 Average interest rate 4.40 4.40 4.40 4.40 Recovery Zone Bonds, variable interest rate 4,530 4,530 4,530 4,530 4,530 36,320 58,970 58,970 Average year-end interest rate 2.94 2.94 2.94 2.94 2.94 2.94 2.94 Senior Notes, fixed interest rate 350,000 350,000 292,250 Average interest rate 4.00 4.00 
 (1) Excludes interest rate swap that fixes at 3.962 the interest rate on 24.5 million of variable interest rate debt. (2) Excludes interest rate swap that fixes at 2.998 the interest rate on 124.6 million of variable interest rate debt. The Company will occasionally utilize financial or derivative instruments for interest rate risk management but has typically not utilized highly leveraged financial instruments. On the basis of the fair value of the Company s market sensitive instruments at September 30, 2023, the Company does not consider the potential near-term losses in future earnings, fair values and cash flows from reasonably possible near-term changes in interest rates and exchange rates to be material. Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The Company s financial statements required by this item are set forth as a separate section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference in this Item 8.

Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None. Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Conclusion Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance to achieve the objective that information in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified and pursuant to the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, include controls and procedures designed to ensure the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be noted that the Company s system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2023, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2023. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in a reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Company has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, using the criteria described in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its assessment of the design and related testing of the Company s internal control over financial reporting management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in the COSO framework. The Company s independent auditors, Deloitte Touche LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors. Deloitte Touche LLP has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Company s internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change during the Company s fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that was identified in connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Ingles Markets, Incorporated Black Mountain, North Carolina Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ingles Markets, Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 30, 2023 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 29, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Vendor Allowances Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Critical Audit Matter Description The Company receives funds for a variety of merchandising activities from certain vendors whose products the Company buys for resale in its stores. These incentives and allowances are primarily comprised of volume or purchase based incentives, advertising allowances, slotting fees, and promotional discounts. These allowances generally relate to short term arrangements with vendors, often relating to a period of a month or less and are negotiated on a purchase-by-purchase or transaction-by-transaction basis. Vendor discounts and allowances that relate to buying and merchandising activities are recorded as a reduction of inventory cost and recognized in cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold. Vendor advertising allowances that represent a reimbursement of specific identifiable incremental costs of advertising the vendor s specific products are recorded as a reduction to the related expense in the period that the related expense is incurred. We identified vendor allowances as a critical audit matter because of the number and diversity of individual vendors agreements. This required an increased extent of effort when performing procedures to evaluate whether the vendor allowances were recorded in accordance with the terms of the vendor agreements. 

 27 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to whether vendor allowances were recorded in accordance with the terms of the vendor agreements included the following, among others: We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over vendor allowances, including management s controls over the accrual and recording of vendor allowances as a reduction to the cost of inventory, cost of sales, or advertising expense in accordance with the terms of the vendor agreements. We selected a sample of transactions and tested for the appropriateness of recorded reductions to inventory, cost of sales or advertising expense. We selected a sample of vendors and sent confirmations to test the completeness of programs as well as the accuracy of amounts earned and terms of the agreement directly with the vendor. /s/ November 29, 2023 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2012.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Ingles Markets, Incorporated Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Ingles Markets, Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, of the Company and our report dated November 29, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Charlotte, North Carolina November 29, 2023

The interest rate swap effectively hedges floating rate debt in the same amount as the current notional amount of the interest swap. Both the floating rate debt and the interest rate swap have monthly principal amortization of million and mature in fiscal year 2030. The Company recognizes differences between the variable rate interest payments and the fixed interest rate settlements with the swap counterparties as an adjustment to interest expense each period over the life of the swaps. The Company has designated the swaps as cash flow hedges and records the changes in the estimated fair value of the swaps to other comprehensive income each period. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded million of other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Unrealized gains of million are recorded as an asset at fair value in the line Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2023. For the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022, the Company recorded million of other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Unrealized gains of million are recorded as an asset at fair value in the line Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 24, 2022. Failure of the swap counterparty to make payments would result in the loss of any potential benefit to the Company under the swap agreement. In this case, the Company would still be obligated to pay the variable interest payments underlying the debt agreements. Additionally, failure of the swap counterparty would not eliminate the Company s obligation to continue to make payments under the existing swap agreement if it continues to be in a net pay position.
