 RISK FACTORS SUMMARY 
 We are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including operating and market risks, industry risks, strategic risks, financial risks, legal and regulatory risks and certain general risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Risks that we deem material are described under Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Measures taken to offset the impact of adverse macroeconomic conditions to maintain our profitability, including increasing prices or decreasing product sizes, may be ineffective, inadequate or unavailable or may otherwise adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, including periods of inflation, rising interest rates, volatility in capital markets, an economic recession or economic uncertainty, could harm our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Increased costs for raw materials, energy and other supplies, or limited availability of such inputs, could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We may not be able to operate successfully if we lose the services of key employees or are unable to recruit, hire, retain and develop a qualified and diverse workforce. 
 We are currently dependent upon third parties for the supply of materials for and the manufacture of many of our products. Our businesses could suffer as a result of a third party s inability to supply materials for our products or produce our products for us on time or to our specifications. 
 We have substantial debt and high leverage, which could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position and could adversely affect our businesses. 
 Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks related to our debt and leverage. 
 The agreements governing our debt, including the indentures governing our senior notes, contain, or may in future financings contain, various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests, and failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 We operate in categories with strong competition. 
 United States and global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers, third-party manufacturers, customers, distributors or financial institutions. 
 Our financial results may be adversely affected by increases in freight costs or limited freight carrier availability. 
 We must identify changing consumer and customer preferences and behaviors and develop and offer products to meet these preferences and behaviors. 
 Our sales and profit growth are dependent upon our ability to expand existing market penetration, enter into new markets and enhance our product portfolio with innovative and profitable products. 
 If our products become adulterated or contaminated, or if they are misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall or withdraw those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers or their pets are injured. 
 Damage to our reputation could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Violations of laws or regulations, as well as new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations or to interpretations thereof, could adversely affect our businesses. 
 Agricultural diseases or pests could harm our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Pending and future litigation may impair our reputation or cause us to incur significant costs. 
 We may be unable to successfully integrate the Pet Food operations and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, or the parties may be unable to fulfill their obligations under agreements related to the acquisition.

Table of Cont e n t s 

 Our announced acquisition of Perfection is subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions and may not be consummated, which could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the price of our common stock. 
 Our business strategy depends upon us identifying and completing additional acquisitions and other strategic transactions. We may not be able to successfully consummate favorable strategic transactions in the future. Our corporate development activities also may have an adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We may experience difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, or acquisitions may not perform as expected. 
 Unsuccessful implementation of business strategies to reduce costs, or unintended consequences of the implementation of such strategies, may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance and forward-looking statements. 
 Impairment in the carrying value of intangible assets could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we will be required to record impairment charges, which may be significant. 
 If the transactions we undertook relating to divestitures of our interest in BellRing Brands, Inc. do not qualify for their intended tax treatment, we may incur significant tax liabilities. 
 Increases in labor-related costs, including the costs of medical and other employee health and welfare benefits, may reduce our profitability. 
 Our Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments operate in the mature ready-to-eat cereal category, and the weakening of this category could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The loss of, a significant reduction of purchases by or the bankruptcy of a major customer may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, consolidation of our customer base, as well as competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, may hurt our volumes or profit margins. 
 Technology failures or cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our businesses. 
 Our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands. 
 Termination of our material intellectual property licenses could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. 
 Labor strikes or work stoppages by our employees could harm our businesses. 
 Our international operations subject us to additional risks. 
 National or international disputes, political instability, terrorism, war or armed hostilities may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees, facilities, suppliers, customers and information systems and could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Public health crises may adversely impact our financial and operational performance. 
 Our Company has overlapping directors and management with BellRing Brands, Inc. and 8th Avenue Food Provisions, Inc., each of which may lead to conflicting interests or the appearance of conflicting interests. 
 Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 Recent Strategic Transactions 
 Post Holdings Partnering Corporation 
 In May and June 2021, Post and Post Holdings Partnering Corporation PHPC ), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the initial public offering of 34.5 million units of PHPC (the PHPC Units, and such transaction, the PHPC IPO ), of which a wholly-owned subsidiary of Post PHPC Sponsor purchased 4.0 million PHPC Units. Each PHPC Unit consisted of one share of Series A common stock of PHPC PHPC Series A Common Stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock at an exercise price of 11.50 per share (the PHPC Warrants ). The PHPC Units, PHPC Series A Common Stock and PHPC Warrants each traded on the NYSE. Under the terms of the PHPC IPO, PHPC was required to consummate a partnering transaction by May 28, 2023, which could have been extended to August 28, 2023 in certain circumstances (the Combination Period ). 
 Substantially concurrently with the closing of the PHPC IPO, PHPC completed a series of related transactions, including the private sale of 1.1 million units of PHPC (the PHPC Private Placement Units; each PHPC Private Placement Unit

 consisted of one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant of PHPC to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock at an exercise price of 11.50 per share (the PHPC Private Placement Warrants )) to PHPC Sponsor (the PHPC Private Placement and the entry into a forward purchase agreement with PHPC Sponsor, which provided for the purchase by PHPC Sponsor, at the election of PHPC, of up to 10.0 million units of PHPC (the PHPC Forward Purchase Units, with each PHPC Forward Purchase Unit consisting of one share of PHPC s Series B common stock and one-third of one warrant to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock) for a purchase price of 10.00 per PHPC Forward Purchase Unit, in a private placement to occur concurrently with the closing of PHPC s partnering transaction. 
 In addition, Post, through PHPC Sponsor s ownership of 8.6 million shares of Series F common stock of PHPC (the PHPC Series F Common Stock ), had certain governance rights in PHPC relating to the election of PHPC directors and voting rights on amendments to PHPC s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 
 Proceeds of 345.0 million were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of PHPC s public stockholders, which consisted of certain proceeds from the PHPC IPO and certain proceeds from the PHPC Private Placement, net of underwriters discounts and commissions and other costs and expenses, and which were invested only in U.S. treasury securities. 
 On May 11, 2023, PHPC announced that it would not complete a partnering transaction within the Combination Period and that the entity would liquidate and dissolve in accordance with the terms of its amended and restated certificate of incorporation. On May 28, 2023, the PHPC Warrants and the PHPC Private Placement Warrants expired worthless, and the Forward Purchase Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms, as PHPC had not completed a partnering transaction before the expiration of the Combination Period. On May 30, 2023, PHPC redeemed all of the outstanding public shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock (the PHPC Redemption ). Each share of PHPC Series A Common Stock was redeemed for approximately 10.24 per share, representing the per share price equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the trust account not previously released to pay taxes or dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock. Subsequent to the PHPC Redemption, PHPC delisted from the NYSE and dissolved in June 2023, and all classes of shares of PHPC equity were cancelled, including the shares of PHPC Series F Common Stock, which were surrendered by PHPC Sponsor for no consideration. PHPC Sponsor subsequently dissolved in August 2023. 
 For additional information regarding the PHPC IPO, the PHPC Redemption and related transactions, refer to Note 5 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 BellRing Brands, Inc. 
 On October 21, 2019, the initial public offering of a minority interest in our historical active nutrition business was completed (the BellRing IPO ). As a result of the BellRing IPO and certain other transactions completed in connection with the BellRing IPO (the BellRing formation transactions ), BellRing Brands, Inc. Old BellRing became a holding company owning 28.8 of the non-voting membership units (the BellRing LLC units of BellRing Brands, LLC and a publicly-traded company with its Class A common stock, 0.01 par value per share (the Old BellRing Class A Common Stock ), trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol BRBR . Immediately after the BellRing IPO, Post owned 71.2 of the BellRing LLC units and one share of Old BellRing s Class B common stock, 0.01 par value per share (the Old BellRing Class B Common Stock ). 
 On March 9, 2022, Post contributed its share of Old BellRing Class B Common Stock, all of its BellRing LLC units and cash to BellRing Brands, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Distribution, LLC) BellRing in exchange for certain limited liability company interests in BellRing and the right to receive 840.0 million in aggregate principal amount of BellRing s 7.00 senior notes maturing in 2030 (the BellRing Notes, and such transactions are collectively referred to as the BellRing Contribution ). On March 10, 2022, BellRing converted into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to BellRing Brands, Inc. , and Post consummated the distribution of 80.1 of its ownership interest in BellRing common stock, 0.01 par value per share BellRing Common Stock ), to Post s shareholders (the BellRing Distribution, and such transaction, the BellRing Contribution, the BellRing Merger (as defined below) and the Debt-for-Debt Exchange (which refers to Post s delivery of the BellRing Notes to certain of its lenders in full satisfaction of certain of its debt obligations on March 10, 2022, as described in more detail in Note 16 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report) are collectively referred to as the BellRing Spin-off ). Upon completion of the BellRing Distribution, BellRing Merger Sub Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing, merged with and into Old BellRing (the BellRing Merger ), with Old BellRing continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing. Pursuant to the BellRing Merger, each outstanding share of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock was converted into one share of BellRing Common Stock plus 2.97 in cash. As a result of the BellRing Spin-off, BellRing became the holding company for the legacy Old BellRing business. Immediately following the BellRing Spin-off, Post owned 14.2 of the BellRing Common Stock, and Post shareholders owned 57.3 of the BellRing Common Stock. The former Old BellRing stockholders owned 28.5 of the BellRing Common Stock, maintaining the same effective percentage ownership interest in the BellRing business as prior to the

 BellRing Spin-off. The BellRing Distribution was structured in a manner intended to qualify as a tax-free distribution to Post shareholders for United States U.S. federal income tax purposes, except to the extent of any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock. For additional information regarding the BellRing Spin-off, refer to Note 4 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 On August 11, 2022, Post transferred 14.8 million shares of BellRing Common Stock to certain of its lenders to repay and retire 342.3 million in aggregate principal amount of debt (such exchange, the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange ).

 8th Avenue 
 On October 1, 2018, 8th Avenue was separately capitalized by Post and third parties through a series of transactions (the 8th Avenue Formation Transactions ), and 8th Avenue became the holding company for Post s private brand food products business. After completion of the 8th Avenue Formation Transactions, Post retained 60.5 of the common equity in 8th Avenue, which, since October 1, 2018, has been accounted for using the equity method. Our investment in 8th Avenue was recorded at zero as of September 30, 2023. For additional information regarding 8th Avenue, refer to Note 5 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 8th Avenue primarily manufactures and distributes private label peanut and other nut butters, pasta, dried fruit and nut products and granola.

Since our formation, we have expanded and established new platforms through numerous acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy has focused on businesses with product offerings that can strengthen our current portfolio, enable us to expand into complementary categories, geographic regions or distribution channels or provide diversification of cash flows in similar channels. In addition to acquisitions, we also have pursued and completed other types of strategic transactions. For example, we separately capitalized 8th Avenue with third parties in fiscal 2019, facilitated the completion of the BellRing IPO in fiscal 2020, the PHPC IPO in fiscal 2021, the BellRing Spin-off and the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange in fiscal 2022 and the Second Debt-for-Equity Exchange in fiscal 2023 and have completed other divestitures from time to time.

 Foodservice 
 Through our Foodservice segment, we primarily produce and distribute egg and potato products in the foodservice and food ingredient channels. We provide a broad portfolio of egg products under several brands, with the primary brands being Papetti s and Abbotsford Farms , and potato products. The Foodservice segment also manufactures certain meat products. Our operations include fourteen egg products production facilities in the U.S., some of which are fully integrated from the maintenance of laying flocks through the processing of egg products, three potato processing facilities and two meat products processing and production facilities. Several of these production facilities also produce products for our Refrigerated Retail segment. In addition, our Foodservice business constructed a new manufacturing facility in West Jefferson, Ohio to manufacture ready-to-drink shakes as a third-party manufacturer for BellRing, and such facility is expected to begin manufacturing products in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Refrigerated Retail 
 Through our Refrigerated Retail segment, we produce and distribute side dishes, eggs and egg products, sausage, cheese and other dairy and refrigerated products to retail customers. Our refrigerated side dish, potato and sausage products are sold primarily under the Bob Evans , Bob Evans Farms and Simply Potatoes brands. We sell private label egg products as well as branded egg products primarily under the Bob Evan s Egg Whites and Egg Beaters brands. Our cheese and other dairy case products are sold principally under the Crystal Farms brand. Our products are manufactured across eleven facilities, five of which are egg products processing facilities and two of which are potato processing facilities previously referenced under the Foodservice segment discussion. In addition, our Egg Beaters products are manufactured under a co-manufacturing agreement at a third-party facility, and we also use third-party manufacturers for many of our cheese products and certain of our potato side dish and sausage products. 
 Products 
 Cereal sold by our Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments together accounted for 39.1 of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023. Eggs and egg products sold by our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments together accounted for 33.0 of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023, and side dishes (including potato products) sold by our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments together accounted for 10.5 of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023. Pet food sold by our Post Consumer Brands segment accounted for 9.7 of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023, which represents the period from the completion of the Pet Food acquisition through fiscal 2023 year end. For additional information regarding our net sales by product, refer to Note 21 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 Each of our businesses has developed marketing strategies specific to its product lines. For certain of our products, we have consumer-targeted marketing campaigns, which generally include television, digital and print advertisements, coupon offers, rebate programs, co-marketing arrangements with complementary consumer product and entertainment companies and joint advertising with select retail customers. We also generally use print and digital advertising and social media, as well as more targeted grass roots programs such as sampling events, in order to increase brand awareness and loyalty at both national and local levels. Our internet and social media efforts are used to educate consumers about the nutritional value and flavor profiles of our products and for product promotion and consumer entertainment. 
 Our Post Consumer Brands segment sells products primarily through an internal sales staff and broker organizations. Our Weetabix segment services its key U.K. markets through a centralized commercial team which manages relationships with customers at the corporate level while a third-party sales force operates at the store level to ensure maximum availability and compliance with agreed plans. Weetabix has in-country sales and marketing teams in Europe and in the growth markets of Spain and the United Arab Emirates. Our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments sell and market their products primarily through dedicated teams of internal sales staff and broker organizations. 
 Generally, our products are distributed through a network of third-party common carriers. In addition, our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments have internal fleets that distribute certain of their products. 
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development efforts span our business segments. These capabilities extend to ingredients, packaging technologies, product sizes and delivery formats; new product and process development, as well as analytical support; bench-top and pilot plant capabilities; and research support to operations. 
 We leverage our research and development resources for both growth and efficiency initiatives. Our innovation and new product development objectives include growth through new products, customer satisfaction and reduced production costs. Our innovation efforts focus on anticipating consumer demands and adapting quickly to changing market trends. We also evaluate the sustainability impacts of our manufacturing processes and products in our research and development activities and continue

 to drive processing innovations aimed at complying with regulatory requirements, reducing waste, water usage and greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the recycled content and recyclability of packaging while maintaining food safety and quality. 
 Raw Materials and Energy 
 Raw materials used in our businesses (purchased from local, regional and international suppliers) include ingredients and packaging materials. The principal ingredients for the Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments are wheat, oats, rice, corn, other grain products, vegetable oils, dairy- and vegetable-based proteins, sugar and other sweeteners, fruit and nuts. In addition, our Post Consumer Brands segment uses animal proteins and fats in its pet food products. The principal ingredients for the Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments are eggs, pork, pasta, potatoes, bakery products, cheese, milk and butter. A portion of our egg needs comes from Company-owned layer hens, and the balance is purchased under third-party contracts and in the spot market. We also buy significant amounts of grain to feed layer hens. In addition, we procure live sows at prevailing market prices, and under fixed price contracts, from terminals, local auctions, country markets and corporate and family farms in various U.S. locations. Our businesses also use large quantities of water. Each of our segments utilizes raw material sources that ensure that its products meet standards, certifications and customer requirements, where applicable, for example, non-GMO, organic, gluten-free and/or cage-free. The principal packaging materials used by our businesses are folding cartons, corrugated boxes, flexible and rigid plastic film, trays and containers, beverage packaging, plastic lined cartonboard, large format bags and steel cans and lids. Our Refrigerated Retail segment also uses large quantities of carbon dioxide as a cooling agent during its sausage production. 
 In addition, our manufacturing and distribution operations use large quantities of natural gas, electricity and diesel fuel. Cereal processing ovens, pet food manufacturing processes and most of the Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail production facilities generally are fueled by natural gas, which is obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers. Electricity and steam (generated in on-site, gas-fired boilers) also are used in our manufacturing facilities. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products, including in our internal fleets. Weetabix owns and operates its own combined heat and power generation unit, which is capable of supplying the majority of the requirements of its main operation site with power and steam which means the site can be operated using either electricity or natural gas. 
 Supply availability and prices paid for raw materials and energy can fluctuate widely due to external factors, including, as applicable, inflation, labor shortages, increased fuel costs, limited freight carrier availability, public health crises, strikes or other labor unrest, war or armed hostilities, geopolitical events or tensions, national or international disputes, terrorism or other acts of violence, increased demand, increased compliance costs associated with new or changing government regulations, any naturally occurring or climate change induced acute (including extreme weather and natural disasters) or chronic (including prolonged temperature and weather patterns) climatic events, fire, water stress, animal feed costs, agricultural yield, governmental programs, incentives or controls, regulations or trade and tariff policies, insects, plant diseases, diseases affecting livestock (including avian influenza and PEDV) and milk price supports established by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the USDA ). Higher prices for natural gas, electricity and fuel also increase our ingredient, production and delivery costs. In addition, the prices of inputs may increase as we pursue more sustainable, specially sourced or certified raw materials or alternative energy sources, including mandatory or voluntary transitions to low carbon renewables (some of which we have experienced). 
 We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends for our raw materials and energy needs to enable us to take appropriate action to obtain the necessary raw materials and energy for our operations. During fiscal 2023, we continued to experience heightened raw materials and energy costs, largely due to cost pressures resulting from macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates, labor shortages and downstream economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. We expect these pressures to continue into fiscal 2024 for certain categories, but for our domestic operations, at a slower rate than we experienced in fiscal 2023. In addition, from time to time, we experience diminished supply or shortages of certain of our inputs, which have resulted, and may in the future result, in us paying increased costs for our inputs or have impacted, and may in the future impact, our ability to produce our products. 
 Trademarks and Intellectual Property 
 We own or have long-term licenses to use a number of trademarks that are critical to the success of our businesses. Our Post Consumer Brands business s trademarks include Post , Post Consumer Brands , Honey Bunches of Oats , Great Grains , Post Bran Flakes, Post Shredded Wheat, Spoon Size Shredded Wheat, Golden Crisp , Alpha-Bits , Ohs! , Shreddies , Post Raisin Bran, Grape-Nuts, Honeycomb , Frosted Mini Spooners , Golden Puffs , Cinnamon Toasters , Fruity Dyno-Bites , Cocoa Dyno-Bites , Berry Colossal Crunch , Malt-O-Meal , Farina , Dyno-Bites , Mom s Best , Better Oats , CoCo Wheats , Peter Pan , Nutrish , Nature s Recipe , 9Lives , Kibbles n Bits , Gravy Train , Weetabix , Barbara s and Puffins , each of which we own, as well as several trademarks that we license from third parties for use in the U.S., Canada and several other international markets, such as Pebbles , Oreo O s , Chips Ahoy! , Honeymaid, Rachael Ray and Premier Protein. The trademarks for the Weetabix business include Weetabix , Alpen , Weetos , Ready Brek , Weetabix On The Go , Oatibix and UFIT , each of which we own, as well as Oreo O s , which we license from a third party. The trademarks for the Foodservice business include Michael Foods , Papetti s ,

 Abbotsford Farms , Simply Potatoes , Henningsen Foods and Almark Foods , each of which we own. The trademarks for the Refrigerated Retail business include Davidson s Safest Choice , Abbotsford Farms , Better n Eggs , Crystal Farms , Simply Potatoes , Diner s Choice , Westfield Farms , David s Deli , Owens , Country Creek Farm and Egg Beaters , each of which we own, Bob Evans (which is used in brands such as Bob Evans Egg Whites), Bob Evans Farms and Pineland Farms , which we license from a third party for worldwide use, and Old El Paso , which we license from a third party for use in the U.S. We also own the trademarks for Airly and Oat Clouds . Our owned trademarks are, in most cases, protected through registration in the U.S. or the U.K., as well as in many other countries where the related products are sold. 
 In addition, we market certain of our products in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and several other locations pursuant to intellectual property license agreements. 
 Depending on the jurisdiction, our trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of our trademarks also can generally be renewed indefinitely for as long as the trademarks are in use. As a general matter, our trademark and other intellectual property licenses with third parties have varying terms and must be periodically renegotiated or renewed pursuant to their terms. 
 We also own several patents in North America and elsewhere. While our patent portfolio as a whole is material to our business, no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business. In addition, we have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered. 
 We rely on a combination of trademark law, copyright law, trade secrets, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, provisions in other agreements and other measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights to our products, packaging, processes and intellectual property. 
 Seasonality 
 Demand for certain of our products may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or other events, which may impact customer and consumer spending patterns and the timing of promotional activities. For example, demand for our egg products, potatoes, sausage, side dishes, butter and cheese tends to increase during the Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter and other holiday seasons, which may result in increased net sales during the corresponding quarters of our fiscal year when such holidays occur. However, on a consolidated basis our net sales and results of operations generally are distributed relatively evenly over the quarters of our fiscal year. 
 Customers 
 We sell Post Consumer Brands products primarily to grocery stores, mass merchandise customers, supercenters, club stores, natural/specialty stores, dollar stores, discounters, wholesalers, convenience stores, pet supply retailers and drug store customers. We also sell Post Consumer Brands products in the military, eCommerce and foodservice channels. Our Weetabix segment s products are primarily sold to retailers, discounters, wholesalers and convenience stores and through eCommerce. Our Foodservice segment s primary customers include foodservice distributors and national restaurant chains. Our Refrigerated Retail segment s primary customers include grocery stores and mass merchandise customers. 
 Our largest customer, Walmart, accounted for 17.3 of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2023. No other customer accounted for more than 10 of our fiscal 2023 consolidated net sales, but each of our segments depends on sales to large customers. For example, the largest customer of our Post Consumer Brands segment, Walmart, accounted for 32.6 of Post Consumer Brands s net sales in fiscal 2023. The largest customers of our Weetabix segment, Tesco and Asda, accounted for 28.3 of Weetabix s net sales in fiscal 2023. The largest customers of our Foodservice segment, Sysco and US Foods, accounted for 40.5 of the segment s net sales in fiscal 2023. Additionally, the largest customers of our Refrigerated Retail segment, Walmart and Kroger, accounted for 32.9 of the segment s net sales in fiscal 2023. For purposes of this disclosure, Walmart refers to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, which include Sam s Club. 
 Competition 
 The human and pet food categories in which we operate are highly competitive and highly sensitive to both pricing and promotion. Competition is based on, among other things, brand appeal, recognition and loyalty, taste, nutritional value, price, ingredients, product quality, product availability, variety, innovation, distribution, shelf space and product visibility, packaging, convenience, effective promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Our principal competitors in these categories may have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. In addition, in many of our product categories, we compete not only with widely advertised branded products, but also with private label and store brand products. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include effective customer relationship management, category insights, superior product quality and food safety, product innovation, an efficient supply chain and competitive pricing. The categories in which we operate are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future.

Table of Cont e n t s 

 During fiscal 2023, due to adverse macroeconomic conditions, including increased product pricing occurring as a result of heightened costs, our retail businesses have experienced shifts to private label and other value brands. We expect this trend to continue into fiscal 2024. For additional information regarding the risks related to competition and demand for our products, refer to Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. 
 Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities and agencies. Our activities in Canada and Europe are subject to regulations similar to those applicable to our businesses in the U.S. As a producer and distributor of goods for human and animal consumption, our operations must comply with stringent production, packaging, quality, safety, storage, distribution, labeling and marketing standards administered by the applicable government entities, namely the Food and Drug Administration (the FDA ), the USDA, the Federal Trade Commission and state and local agencies in the U.S., as well as similar regulatory agencies in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., the European Union (the E.U. and elsewhere. Products that do not meet regulatory standards may be considered to be adulterated and/or misbranded and subject to recall. 
 Our facilities, like those of similar businesses, are subject to certain safety regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar regulations in Canada and the U.K. These regulations require us to comply with certain safety standards to protect our employees and on-site contractors. Further, certain of our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail operations are subject to laws that mandate specific housing requirements for layer hens and mandate specific space requirements for farm animal enclosures, including layer hens and pigs, which laws vary on a state to state basis. Our operations and products also are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air quality, noise, wastewater pretreatment and discharge, storm water, waste management, product stewardship, packaging composition and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. 
 We are subject to various laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment, paid leave and overtime compensation. We also are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and other countries related to anti-corruption, antitrust and competition, economic sanctions and imports/exports. In addition, our operations are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy, including the General Data Protection Regulation, the E.U. s retained law version of the General Data Protection Regulation, the E.U.-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the California Consumer Privacy Act (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act), each of which applies to certain of our businesses and deals with the collection and use of personal information obtained from data subjects. We also are subject to tax and securities regulations, accounting and reporting standards and other financial laws and regulations. 
 We continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations. While the impact of laws and regulations on our businesses cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently do not believe that compliance with existing laws and regulations will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 
 Human Capital 
 Post and its consolidated subsidiaries have 11,430 employees as of November 1, 2023, of which 9,790 are in the U.S., 1,080 are in the U.K., 420 are in Canada and 140 are located in other jurisdictions. As of November 1, 2023, 20 of such employees were unionized. We have entered into several collective bargaining agreements on terms that we believe are typical for the industries in which we operate. Most of the unionized workers at our facilities are represented under contracts which expire at various times throughout the next several years. In general, as these agreements expire, we believe that the agreements can be renegotiated on satisfactory terms. Any new collective bargaining agreements could result in changes to our cost structure at the relevant facilities. We believe that overall we have good relationships with our employees and their representative organizations. 
 Our people are critical to our success. While each of our businesses generally operates autonomously to implement its talent acquisition and management strategies with respect to its employees, our organization aligns to provide a safe, rewarding and respectful workplace where employees have opportunities to pursue development and career paths based on their skills, performance and potential. 
 Company Ethics 
 Our Code of Conduct reflects our commitment to our stakeholders, including our employees, to conduct our businesses ethically, responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. To encourage open and honest communication throughout our organization, our employees have access to an employee speak up line, which is operated by a third-party provider, is available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week in multiple languages and allows for anonymous reports.

 Health and Safety 
 We are committed to maintaining a healthy and safe workplace for our employees. We adhere to a global environmental, health, safety and sustainability policy. We utilize a comprehensive safety and risk management system that incorporates rigorous safety standards and practices, employee and leadership training to ensure consistent implementation of our safety protocols and periodic internal and external audits to evaluate our compliance with such policies. Through regular communications between safety teams and leaders, we strive to continuously improve and update our safety protocols and practices. Our senior leadership team and our Board of Directors receive periodic updates regarding the performance of our safety and risk management system and our risk mitigation activities. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic led to unique challenges, and throughout the pandemic, we highlighted, invested in and recognized the importance of our employees, including by implementing additional safety protocols as part of our health and safety program. 
 Talent Acquisition, Development, Engagement and Retention 
 Acquiring, developing, engaging and retaining a diverse and talented workforce is key to achieving our business goals. 
 We continue to enhance our talent acquisition strategy across the enterprise through community outreach initiatives, by providing training and resources to our recruiters and people leaders on interviewing skills, through job description development and by enhancing our career websites and resources. 
 We believe encouraging internal mobility is a key strategy to reducing attrition by retaining critical talent across our organization, as well as building succession plans with such employees future roles in mind. We continue to implement initiatives to encourage and remove barriers to internal mobility opportunities. To further increase our talent pool, we also provide robust intern programs designed to provide experience and assist with development of skills to diverse and qualified college students. 
 Another key factor in our human capital management strategy is providing development opportunities and resources for our employees. We offer a variety of training and development programs for employees. In addition, we encourage building individual development plans and offer a large array of training resources, ranging from technical skills to behavioral skills. We also provide robust compliance training. 
 Our businesses conduct engagement surveys and then use those results to understand strengths and areas of opportunity. Many of our employees participate in company-organized volunteer events which foster a sense of community and giving. 
 We continue to review, evaluate and implement solutions and resources that address the physical and mental health and overall well-being of our employees. Our Total Rewards programs, plans and policies are designed to be comprehensive and competitive, support our business goals and be cost effective and promote shared fiscal responsibility. To support the health and financial needs of our employees, we offer competitive fixed and/or variable pay and a suite of benefit plans and programs to eligible employees, including medical, prescription drug, dental, vision, life insurance, disability coverage, paid time off, employee assistance and defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans and programs. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 We are committed to building an inclusive culture throughout our organization. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, which has representation from our holding company and each of our businesses, develops strategies, helps establish and implement initiatives for diversity, equity and inclusion DEI and creates tools that can be used to align efforts and monitor and track progress across our organization. During fiscal 2023, our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council established working committees (dedicated to image, suppliers, talent and culture) to focus and refine its efforts. 
 Our Company s DEI initiatives include: (i) conducting a standardized DEI training program utilized throughout our organization to establish a consistent foundation of knowledge and foster more inclusive work environments; (ii) forming and supporting employee resource groups throughout our organization with a focus on DEI; (iii) integrating inclusive business practices to eliminate bias in talent management and procurement; (iv) issuing our DEI newsletter biannually; and (v) operating an employee speak-up line to encourage a speak up culture with regard to DEI matters. Our Board of Directors receives periodic updates regarding our DEI efforts.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although the risks below are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks to us, additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Operating and Market Risks 
 Measures taken to offset the impact of adverse macroeconomic conditions to maintain our profitability, including increasing prices or decreasing product sizes, may be ineffective, inadequate or unavailable or may otherwise adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 From time to time, we take measures to mitigate the impact of adverse macroeconomic conditions, including increased costs for ingredients, packaging, energy, other supplies and freight and employee-related costs, through pricing measures (such as increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products). However, the prices charged for our products may not reflect changes in our costs or the impact of other adverse events at the time they occur or at all. When these measures are ineffective or are not implemented in a timely manner, changes in costs and the impact of other adverse macroeconomic conditions may limit our ability to maintain existing margins and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows (some of which we experienced in fiscal 2023 and may experience in the future). Further, we may not be able to raise our prices sufficiently in response to cost increases or other adverse macroeconomic conditions (including if inflation or cost increases outpace our price elasticities or as a result of competitive pressures). In addition, such price increases could result in decreased sales volume or consumption or shifts to private label or other value brands, some of which we have experienced during fiscal 2023 and expect to experience during fiscal 2024. These impacts may be intensified by reductions in governmental assistance programs or incentives (as examples, the discontinuation of the heightened Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits that were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, which occurred during fiscal 2023, and the resumption of student loan repayments that were temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic, which occurred in October 2023). 
 Deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, including periods of inflation, rising interest rates, volatility in capital markets, an economic recession or economic uncertainty, could harm our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We have in the past been and may continue to be adversely affected by changes in macroeconomic conditions, including periods of inflation, rising interest rates, decreased availability of capital, volatility in financial markets, declining consumer spending rates, recessions, decreased energy availability and increased energy costs (including fuel surcharges), supply chain challenges, labor shortages, geopolitical events or tensions, the negative impacts caused by government shutdowns, the negative impacts caused by public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. 
 Such adverse macroeconomic conditions and ongoing economic uncertainty have impacted us and could continue to impact us, or may impact us, in a variety of ways, including: 
 consumers shifting purchases from branded to lower-priced private label or other value products, shifting purchases from traditional retail outlets to mass merchandisers and dollar stores or forgoing certain purchases altogether during economic downturns, which could result in loss of our category share or sales volume or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings; 
 customers managing their inventory levels in response to such adverse macroeconomic conditions; 
 decreased away-from-home demand, which during the COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted our Foodservice business; 
 increased volatility in commodity and other input costs; 
 increased uncollectible receivables or non-performance due to the financial instability of our customers, suppliers, distributors or financial institutions; 
 increases in labor-related costs; 
 increases in the cost or difficulty of obtaining debt or equity financing to fund operations or investment opportunities, or to refinance our debt in the future, in each case on terms and within a time period acceptable to us; and 
 decreases to the fair value of our fixed rate debt and increases to interest expense on our variable rate debt.

 Increased costs for raw materials, energy and other supplies, or limited availability of such inputs, could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows . 
 The primary ingredients used by our businesses include wheat, oats, rice, corn, other grain products, eggs, pork and other animal proteins and fats, pasta, potatoes, bakery products, cheese, milk, butter, vegetable oils, dairy- and vegetable-based proteins, sugar and other sweeteners, fruit, nuts and water. Our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments also use corn and soybean meal as the primary grains fed to layer hens. Our primary packaging materials include folding cartons, corrugated boxes, flexible and rigid plastic film, trays and containers, beverage packaging, plastic lined cartonboard, large format bags and steel cans and lids. In addition, our manufacturing operations use large quantities of natural gas, electricity, diesel fuel, carbon dioxide, sanitizing supplies and personal protective equipment. Considerable amounts of diesel fuel also are used in connection with the distribution of our products, including in our internal fleets. The supply and price of these inputs are subject to market conditions and are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, labor shortages, increased fuel costs, limited freight carrier availability, public health crises, strikes or other labor unrest, war or armed hostilities (such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war), geopolitical events or tensions, national or international disputes, terrorism or other acts of violence, increased demand, increased compliance costs associated with new or changing government regulations, any naturally occurring or climate change induced acute (including extreme weather and natural disasters) or chronic (including prolonged temperature and weather patterns) climatic events, fire, water stress, animal feed costs, agricultural yield, governmental programs, incentives or controls, regulations or trade and tariff policies, insects, plant diseases, diseases affecting livestock (such as the fiscal 2015, 2022 and 2023 avian influenza outbreaks and the 2013 PEDV swine outbreak) and milk price supports established by the USDA. From time to time, higher prices for natural gas, electricity and fuel also increase our ingredient, production and delivery costs. In addition, the prices of inputs may increase as we pursue more sustainable, specially sourced or certified raw materials or alternative energy sources, including mandatory or voluntary transitions to low carbon renewables, some of which we have experienced. 
 While, historically, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, the prices of certain of our raw materials, energy and other supplies used in our businesses have fluctuated, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, labor shortages and rising interest rates, have caused our raw materials and other input costs to increase. We expect these pressures to continue into fiscal 2024 for certain categories, but for our domestic operations, at a slower rate than we experienced in fiscal 2023. Similarly, from time to time, we experience diminished supply or shortages of certain of our inputs, which have resulted, and may in the future result, in us paying increased costs for such inputs or have impacted, and may in the future impact, our ability to produce our products. Although we try to manage the impact of increases in certain of these costs by using hedges to lock in prices on quantities required to meet our anticipated production requirements, if we fail, or are unable, to hedge and prices subsequently increase, or if we institute a hedge and prices subsequently decrease, our costs may be greater than anticipated or greater than our competitors costs, and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In coordination with our suppliers, third-party manufacturers and distributors, our ability to make, move, store and sell products is critical to our success. From time to time, damage or disruption to our collective supply, manufacturing, warehousing or distribution capabilities resulting from inflation, the need for repairs or enhancements at facilities (including delays in repairing, obtaining and installing equipment), execution issues, labor shortages, insufficient product or raw material availability, operational or financial instability of parties in our supply chain, limited freight carrier availability, public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), strikes or other labor unrest, governmental restrictions or mandates, war or armed hostilities, geopolitical events or tensions, national or international disputes, terrorism or other acts of violence, border closures, any naturally occurring or climate change induced acute (including extreme weather and natural disasters) or chronic (including prolonged temperature and weather patterns) climatic events, fire or evacuations related thereto, water stress, insects, plant diseases, diseases affecting livestock (such as the fiscal 2015, 2022 and 2023 avian influenza outbreaks and the 2013 PEDV swine outbreak), explosions, cybersecurity incidents, workforce disruptions (including as a result of widespread employee illness or widespread employee absenteeism) or other reasons impairs our ability to source inputs or manufacture, sell or timely deliver our products. Competitors are, from time to time, affected differently by any of these events depending on a number of factors, including the location of their operations, suppliers, third-party manufacturers and distributors. Failure to take adequate steps to reduce the likelihood or mitigate the potential impact of any of these events, or to effectively manage such events when they occur, particularly when an input is sourced from, or a product is manufactured at, a single location, could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and require additional resources to restore our supply chain. 
 In addition, construction of new or expansions of existing manufacturing facilities and other capital projects could result in manufacturing delays and increased costs (some of which we have experienced and may continue to experience). Further, any construction delays, including those resulting from equipment delays, could impact future demand for our products. If we are unable to complete capital projects within anticipated time frames and within our cost estimates, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.

 We may not be able to operate successfully if we lose the services of key employees or are unable to recruit, hire, retain and develop a qualified and diverse workforce. 
 Our employees are critical to our success. We depend upon the skills, working relationships and continued services of key employees, including members of our senior management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals depends upon our ability to recruit, hire, retain and develop a qualified and diverse workforce to operate and expand our businesses. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for skilled and talented people. During the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our businesses experienced heightened employee turnover and labor shortages, resulting in increased labor-related costs and our inability to meet consumer demand for certain of our products. Furthermore, as a result of such heightened employee turnover, certain of our businesses lost institutional knowledge. As a general matter, recruitment and retention of talent remains challenging in the current employment environment. In addition, a member of our senior management team or other key employee may find it necessary to take a leave of absence due to medical or other reasons. If we lose the services of key employees, including one or more members of our senior management team, and we fail to develop adequate succession plans, or if we fail to hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse talent to operate and expand our businesses, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed. Activities relating to recruiting, hiring, integrating and training our workforce also may require significant time and expense. 
 Our President and Chief Executive Officer is currently on medical leave, and our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer has been appointed to also serve as our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer. The effectiveness of this transition, and any further transition, or the loss of services of any member of our senior management team, including our President and Chief Executive Officer or our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, could materially adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, result of operations or cash flows, significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic objectives and operating goals and cause volatility in our stock price. 
 We are currently dependent upon third parties for the supply of materials for and the manufacture of many of our products. Our businesses could suffer as a result of a third party s inability to supply materials for our products or produce our products for us on time or to our specifications. 
 Our businesses rely on independent third parties for the supply of materials for and the manufacture of many products. Our businesses could be materially affected if we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with these third parties, if any of these third parties is unable to fulfill its obligations to us, if any of these third parties fails to comply with governmental regulations applicable to the supply of materials for or the manufacturing of our products or if any of these third parties ceases doing business with us or goes out of business. Additionally, from time to time, we experience operational difficulties with these third parties, which may include increases in costs, reductions in the availability of materials or production capacity, delays in the addition of incremental capacity, failures to meet shipment or production deadlines, including as a result of public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and related governmental restrictions or mandates and any naturally occurring or climate change induced acute (including extreme weather and natural disasters) or chronic (including prolonged temperature and weather patterns) climatic events, fire and water stress, cybersecurity incidents, errors in complying with specifications and insufficient quality control. The inability of a third-party supplier or manufacturer to ship orders in a timely manner or in desirable quantities or to meet our safety, quality and social compliance standards or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse impact on our businesses, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, certain of our relationships with third-party manufacturers and suppliers require us to purchase minimum volumes, and we could incur significant penalties if we do not purchase the minimum quantities required under these commitments. 
 U.S. and global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers, third-party manufacturers, customers, distributors or financial institutions. 
 U.S. and global credit markets have, from time to time, experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads to applicable reference U.S. Treasury notes on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. In the past, such circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing, any of which could occur in the future. Further, our access to funds under our revolving credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to such facilities to meet their respective funding commitments. Unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, supply chain challenges, labor shortages, high interest rates, lower consumer confidence, foreign currency exchange volatility, volatility in global capital markets, recession risks and macroeconomic uncertainty, have caused, and may in the future cause, periods of increased volatility and pricing in the credit and capital markets. If such periods of increased volatility recur, it may become more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock or other equity securities or debt financings, refinance our existing debt or sell our assets. These and other events affecting the credit and capital markets also have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on other financial markets in the U.S. Our businesses also could be negatively impacted if our suppliers, third-party manufacturers, customers or distributors experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. Any of these risks could impair our 
 17 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 ability to fund our operations, limit our ability to expand our businesses, result in interruptions to our businesses or increase our interest expense, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our financial results may be adversely affected by increases in freight costs or limited freight carrier availability. 
 We rely on trucking and railroad operators to deliver ingredients to manufacturing locations and to deliver our finished products to our customers. Freight costs are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, labor shortages, increased fuel costs, limited freight carrier availability, public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), strikes or other labor unrest, war or armed hostilities (such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine), geopolitical events or tensions (such as between the U.S. and China), national or international disputes, terrorism or other acts of violence, increased demand, increased compliance costs associated with new or changing government regulations and any naturally occurring or climate change induced acute (including extreme weather and natural disasters) or chronic (including prolonged temperature and weather patterns) climatic events. During fiscal 2022, we experienced increased freight costs, which leveled off during fiscal 2023, and we could experience increased freight costs in the future. In addition, shortages of freight operators may impact our ability to manufacture and deliver our products (some of which we have experienced). 
 We must identify changing consumer and customer preferences and behaviors and develop and offer products to meet these preferences and behaviors. 
 Consumer and customer preferences and behaviors evolve over time due to a variety of factors. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to identify these changing preferences and behaviors, to distinguish between short-term trends and long-term changes in such preferences and behaviors and to continue to develop and offer products that appeal to consumers and customers through the sales channels that they prefer. Consumer preference and behavior changes include dietary trends, attention to different nutritional aspects of products, consumer at-home and on-the-go consumption patterns, shifts to private label or other value products, preferences for certain sales channels, concerns regarding the health effects of products, attention to sourcing practices relating to raw materials, animal welfare concerns, environmental concerns (including climate change) regarding packaging and manufacturing processes and attention to other social and governance aspects of our Company (including our products and operations) and of others in our supply chain. Any significant changes in consumer or customer preferences and behaviors and our inability to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In recent years, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer shopping through eCommerce websites and mobile commerce applications has been prominent, and this trend is altering the retail landscape in which many of our products are sold and is intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. If we or our customers are unable to effectively compete in the eCommerce market or develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights, and appropriately act on such insights, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Also, certain weight loss drugs, which may suppress a person s appetite, may impact demand for our products. In addition, our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail businesses are, and will continue to be, affected by changing preferences and requirements as to the housing of layer hens, as well as certain other farm animals. Many restaurant chains, foodservice companies and grocery chains have announced goals to transition to a cage-free egg supply, as well as goals for other farm animal initiatives, by specified future dates. Also, several states have enacted, or may in the future enact, provisions providing for specific requirements for the housing of certain farm animals. Meeting anticipated customer demand has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional operating and capital costs to procure cage-free eggs, to modify existing layer facilities and to construct new cage-free layer housing and to comply with other farm animal initiatives. Also, our businesses are, and we expect will continue to be, affected by changing preferences and requirements as to the environmental and social impacts of products. Several of our customers have announced goals to transition to recyclable, compostable or reusable packaging or require certified ingredients for specific products. From time to time, these changing preferences and requirements require us to use specially sourced ingredients and packaging types that are more difficult to source or entail a higher cost or incremental capital investment, including within our manufacturing processes, which we may not be able to pass on to customers. 
 Our sales and profit growth are dependent upon our ability to expand existing market penetration, enter into new markets and enhance our product portfolio with innovative and profitable products. 
 Successful growth depends upon our ability to add new retail and foodservice customers, enter into new markets, expand the number of products sold through existing customers and enhance our product portfolio with new innovative and profitable products. The development and introduction of new products involves risks, such as the investment associated with developing and marketing such new products, uncertainties regarding trade and consumer acceptance of such new products, the timeliness of such new product introductions and the potential for such new products to cause a decline in sales of our existing products. In addition, our growth depends upon our ability to obtain new customers while also expanding our business with existing customers. Our failure to successfully add new customers, enter into new markets, expand our business with existing customers

 or enhance our product portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Damage to our reputation could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our reputation could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including adverse publicity about us, our business practices, products, packaging, ingredients or sponsorship or endorsement relationships (whether or not valid), our suppliers or third-party manufacturers business practices, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, real or perceived health concerns regarding our products, lawsuits filed against us, our suppliers or our third-party manufacturers, our products becoming unavailable to consumers, consumer perceptions that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, any failure or perceived failure to achieve sufficient environmental, social and governance performance or any failure or perceived failure to act in a manner consistent with stakeholder expectations. In addition, negative perceptions of the food and beverage and pet food industries in their entirety, or segments of the food and beverage and pet food industries in which we operate, may heighten attention from consumers, third parties, the media, governments, our shareholders and other stakeholders and could adversely affect our reputation. The use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative social media posts or comments about us, our business practices, brands, products, ingredients, packaging, sponsorship or endorsement relationships, suppliers or third-party manufacturers or the food and beverage and pet food industries generally (whether or not valid) in the media could damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain favorable perceptions of our Company or brands or if we experience a loss of confidence in us or our products, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. 
 Agricultural diseases or pests could harm our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Many of our business activities are subject to a variety of agricultural risks, including agricultural diseases and pests, which can adversely affect the quality and quantity of the raw materials we use and the products we produce and distribute (or have produced or distributed by third parties), as well as increase the costs of production. Any actual or potential contamination of our products could result in product recalls, market withdrawals, product detentions, safety alerts, cessation of manufacturing or distribution or, if we fail to comply with applicable FDA, USDA or other U.S. or international regulatory authority requirements, enforcement actions. We also could be subject to product liability claims or adverse publicity if any of our products are alleged to have caused illness or injury. 
 Avian influenza occasionally affects the domestic poultry industry, leading to hen deaths. In fiscal 2015, an avian influenza outbreak occurred in the Midwest of the U.S., affecting a substantial portion of our owned and third-party contracted flocks. In addition, in fiscal 2022 and early fiscal 2023, we were impacted by outbreaks of avian influenza. Although we utilize biosecurity measures at our layer locations to protect against disease exposures, if our facilities are exposed to diseases and pests, such exposure could affect a substantial portion of our production facilities in any year and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, diseases affecting livestock (including PEDV) occasionally impact sow supply, which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Technology failures or cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our businesses. 
 Information technology is critically important to our operations. We rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store operating and financial information, to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements and to manage and support our business processes and activities, including our manufacturing operations. We also depend upon our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers and third-party manufacturers and suppliers. With a number of employees working remotely in our workforce, our traditional network boundaries have been extended past our physical facilities, requiring that we protect our systems and data in environments that we do not control. In addition, third parties in our supply chain and other third-party providers, including our third-party suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and service providers Third Parties ), could be a source of security risk to us, or cause disruptions to our normal operations, in the event of a breach of their products, components, networks, security systems or infrastructure. 
 If we do not build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure or maintain or protect the related automated and manual control processes, or if one of our Third Parties fails to provide the products or services we require, we could be subject to, among other things, billing and collection errors, business disruptions or damage resulting from such events, particularly material security breaches and cybersecurity incidents. Our and our Third Parties information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of invasions, interruptions or malfunctions due to events beyond our or their control, including natural disasters, user error, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, power outages, computer viruses, ransomware and malware, hardware and software failures, cybersecurity incidents, hackers and other causes. Such invasions, interruptions or malfunctions could negatively impact our businesses. If any of our or our Third Parties significant information technology systems suffers severe damage, disruption or shutdown, including by malicious or unintentional actions of contractors or employees or by cyber attacks, 
 19 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, there is a risk of business interruption, competitive loss, litigation, violation of data privacy laws, reputational damage and other losses from such events, including any leaks of confidential or personal information resulting therefrom. While we have insurance programs in place related to these matters, the potential liabilities associated with such events, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. In addition, such insurance programs are costly, and the costs could increase substantially over time. 
 Cyber attacks and other cybersecurity incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by individuals and groups (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored institutions, terrorist organizations and individuals or groups participating in organized crime) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, fraud, identity theft, public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm, corporate or nation-state espionage, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons). Our and our Third Parties networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our and their operating environments potentially resulting in cyber intrusions, hacks or ransom attacks with intent to disrupt our and their business operations and capture, destroy, manipulate or expose various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets, customer information, vendor information and other sensitive business information, including acquisition activity, non-public financial results and intellectual property General Cyber Events ). Although we have not detected a material security breach to date, nor have we had a material impact resulting from a breach of one of our Third Parties, we have had and continue to experience General Cyber Events or other events of this nature and expect them to continue. 
 We implement and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cybersecurity incidents, which require significant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of information and cybersecurity incidents and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new and emerging technology is deployed, including the use of generative artificial intelligence and personal mobile and computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments. Risks associated with such incidents and activities include theft of funds and other monetary loss, the disruption of our operations and the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, modification, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary, trade secret or other information (including account data information), the effects of which could be compounded if not detected or reported quickly. An information or cybersecurity incident may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered. 
 Labor strikes or work stoppages by our employees could harm our businesses. 
 Some of our full-time production, maintenance and warehouse employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. A dispute with a union or employees represented by a union could result in production interruptions caused by strikes or work stoppages. If a strike or work stoppage were to occur, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, we periodically renegotiate the collective bargaining agreements in place at our facilities as such agreements expire, and we expect such agreements to be more difficult to negotiate due to, among other factors, heightened expectations from union members on wages, labor market conditions and inflation. As such agreements expire, if we are unable to enter into new agreements on favorable terms, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Further, there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into new agreements in a timely manner, and if new agreements are not reached, there could be interruptions in production at the respective facilities. In addition, we could be subject to unionization efforts at our non-union facilities. Increased unionization of our workforce could lead to disruptions in our businesses, increases in our operating costs and constraints on our operating flexibility. 
 In the event of a strike or work stoppage, we have contingency plans in place to hire additional labor or manufacture products in other locations to mitigate disruption to our businesses. However, there are limitations inherent in any plan to mitigate disruption to our businesses in the event of a strike or work stoppage, and particularly in the case of a prolonged strike or work stoppage, there can be no assurance that it would not have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our international operations subject us to additional risks. 
 We are subject to a number of risks related to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our financial and operational performance. These risks include: 
 restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences; 
 unfavorable changes in trade agreements or treaties, tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, import or export licensing requirements or other trade restrictions; 
 20 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 unfavorable changes in local regulatory requirements that impact our ability to sell our products in that country; 
 unfavorable currency exchange rates; 
 challenges associated with cross-border product distribution, including those that were caused (in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic) or may in the future be caused by a public health crisis; 
 the occurrence of a public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which may cause us or our distributors, third-party manufacturers, vendors or customers to temporarily suspend our or their respective operations in the affected city or country; 
 increased exposure to general market and economic conditions, political and economic uncertainty and volatility and other events, including social unrest, government shutdowns, terrorist activity and other acts of violence, acts of war and other armed hostilities (such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine) and travel restrictions, outside of the U.S.; 
 compliance with U.S. laws and regulations affecting operations outside of the U.S., including anti-corruption regulations (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), and changes to such laws and regulations; 
 compliance with treaties, antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws (including the General Data Protection Regulation and the E.U. s retained law version of the General Data Protection Regulation and the E.U.-U.S. Data Privacy Framework), anti-corruption laws (including the U.K. Bribery Act), food safety and marketing laws and other regulatory requirements and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple jurisdictions and changes to such treaties, laws and regulations; 
 unfavorable changes in foreign tax treaties and policies, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretations or tax audit implications; 
 exposure to evolving regulations and stakeholder expectations related to environmental, social and governance matters, which could have significant implications on our operations, products, marketing and disclosures; 
 the potential difficulty of enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights; 
 increased risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; 
 unfavorable changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing our operations; and 
 the difficulty and costs of designing and implementing an effective data security and control environment across diverse regions and employee bases. 
 In addition, the exit of the U.K. from the E.U. Brexit in 2020 created uncertainty surrounding certain of our businesses. While trading through Brexit has become normal course of business, we continue to plan for and mitigate risks to production post-Brexit. Specifically, as the E.U. and the U.K. amend legislation and regulations post-Brexit, there is a risk of increased divergence between the E.U. and the U.K. regulatory regimes, and we continue to monitor for divergence in regulations which could impact our supply chain operations. We also closely monitor and manage our inventory levels of imported raw materials and finished goods in the U.K. Despite our efforts to control costs, we have continued to see inflationary cost pressures rise in our U.K. business during fiscal 2023, as we also have experienced in other markets. If Brexit, or new trade arrangements between the U.K. and the E.U., negatively impact the U.K. economy or result in disagreements on trade terms, then the impact to our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be material. 
 Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Because we have operations and assets in foreign jurisdictions, as well as a portion of our contracts and revenues denominated in foreign currencies, and our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Consequently, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements. Our principal currency exposures are to the British pound sterling, the Euro and the Canadian dollar. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure. To the extent we fail to manage our foreign currency exposure adequately, we may suffer losses in value of our net investment in a foreign operation, and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected. 
 National or international disputes, political instability, terrorism, war or armed hostilities may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees, facilities, suppliers, customers and information systems and could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Geopolitical events, national or international disputes, political instability, terrorism or other acts of violence, war or armed hostilities, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, may cause damage or disruption to our operations, 
 21 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 international commerce and the global economy. The reactions of governments, markets and the general public to such events, including economic sanctions, trade restrictions, tariffs and boycotts, may result in a number of adverse consequences for our businesses, suppliers and customers. Such events could lead to supply chain and transportation disruptions, constrained availability of raw materials and other commodities, inflation, increased commodity, energy and fuel costs, cyber attacks, breaches of information systems, foreign currency fluctuations and other disruptions that could adversely affect our businesses and our customers, distributors and suppliers. Such events also could result in physical harm to our or our customers , distributors or suppliers employees and property. In addition, such events could cause increased volatility in the capital markets, which could negatively impact our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our existing debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any such events, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein, such as those relating to capital markets, raw materials, energy and freight costs, our supply chain, information security and market conditions, any of which could negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Although we do not have operations in Russia, Ukraine or Belarus and do not have significant direct exposure to customers in those countries, our businesses and operations have been negatively impacted by increased inflation, escalating energy and fuel prices and constrained availability, and thus increasing costs, of certain raw materials and other commodities, and declarations of force majeure by certain suppliers. These and other impacts have caused, and may continue to cause, an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows that may be material. Similarly, although we do not have operations, or significant direct exposure to customers, in Israel or Gaza, our businesses and operations could be negatively impacted by increased energy costs, supply chain disruptions or adverse impacts on customers. 
 Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our businesses, reputation and operations. 
 There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will continue to cause increases in the frequency or severity of any acute (including extreme weather and natural disasters) or chronic (including prolonged temperature and weather patterns) climatic events, fire and water stress. If any of these climatic events has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to disruptions in the availability or less favorable pricing for certain raw materials that are necessary for our products, including wheat, oats, corn and other grain products, sugar, fruit, nuts, eggs, potatoes, animal proteins and dairy products. In addition, increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather or natural disasters may result in damage or disruptions to our manufacturing operations or our third-party manufacturers operations, disrupt our supply chain or distribution channels, impact demand for our products, increase our insurance or other operating costs or require us to make additional mandatory or voluntary capital expenditures. Also, water is essential to our businesses and the safety of our products, and the impacts of these climatic events may cause unpredictable availability of, or usage restrictions on, water of acceptable quality, which may lead to, among other things, adverse effects on our operations. 
 The increasing concern over climate change and related environmental sustainability matters also may result in more federal, state, local and foreign legal requirements, including requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases or conserve and replenish water, implement new sustainability initiatives or comply with additional disclosure obligations. Collecting, measuring, analyzing and auditing information relating to such matters can be costly, time-consuming, dependent on third-party cooperation and unreliable. Our compliance, or our customers , suppliers or third-party manufacturers compliance, with existing laws and regulations and new laws or regulations enacted in the future, or any changes in how existing laws or regulations are enforced, administered or interpreted, may lead to an increase in compliance costs, cause changes in the way operations are conducted or expose us to additional risk of liabilities and claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Also, our customers or consumers may place increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made and certified as such, requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting and for the inputs for such products. Further, our businesses could be adversely affected if we are unable to remain effectively aligned with expectations from the media, shareholders and other stakeholders, which expectations may contradict one another, on strategy, performance and disclosure on climate change and other environmental, social and governance matters, which could result in reduced demand for our products or adverse impacts on our ability to raise capital or could divert the attention of management and our employees from operating our businesses. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting, or perceived failure to meet or delay in meeting, stakeholder expectations on environmental, social and governance matters or any perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to environmental, social or governance matters could lead to adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation, which in turn could adversely impact our financial results or our ability to raise capital, as well as expose us to regulatory and legal risks.

 Public health crises may adversely impact our financial and operational performance. 
 Public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and measures taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to such crises may have significant impacts on our businesses. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced, among other impacts, shifts away from consumption of our foodservice and certain on-the-go products due to reduced consumer traffic or changes in consumer preferences, adverse impacts on our operations and the operations of third parties in our supply chain resulting in disruptions in our ability to manufacture and deliver our products, adverse impacts on our operating costs, unexpected variability and volatility in consumer demand and delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives. The COVID-19 pandemic also resulted in broader economic and operational challenges, including heightened inflation, labor shortages, volatility in commodity and operating costs and supply chain disruptions, and some of such adverse economic conditions continue to impact us. Public health crises evolve rapidly, and the severity, magnitude and duration of such public health crises are uncertain and difficult to predict. Future public health crises may result in similar impacts or additional challenges that we may not be able to foresee. Any public health crisis also may heighten or manifest other risks set forth herein. Any of these impacts may be material to our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Industry Risks 
 We operate in categories with strong competition. 
 The human and pet food categories in which we operate are highly competitive. Competition in our categories is based on, among other things, brand appeal, recognition and loyalty, taste, nutritional value, price, ingredients, product quality, product availability, variety, innovation, distribution, shelf space and product visibility, packaging, convenience, effective promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. The ability of our retail businesses to compete may be limited by an inability to secure new retailers or maintain or add shelf or retail space for our products. Retailers may not provide us sufficient, if any, shelf space, and online retailers may not provide access to, or adequate product visibility on, their platforms. Certain weight loss drugs, which may suppress a person s appetite, may cause competition in our product categories to increase, if consumers reduce purchases of certain types of foods or of food products altogether. Some of our competitors may have substantial financial, marketing and other resources and may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do. In addition, smaller competitors have been gaining market share in categories in which our retail businesses compete. In most of our categories, we compete not only with widely advertised branded products, but also with private label and store brand products. Increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures or can result in increased capital, marketing or other expenditures. Competitive and customer pressures, as well as industry supply and market demand, also may limit our ability to increase prices, including in response to increased costs (such as those resulting from inflation). Also, our competitors continue to expand and evolve their usage of social media networks and digital platforms to advertise products. If we are unable to compete in this environment and use social media and digital platforms effectively, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. 
 Our Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments operate in the mature RTE cereal category, and the weakening of this category could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments produce and distribute branded, licensed and private label RTE cereals and hot cereals, other cereal-based food products and muesli, selling products to grocery stores, discounters, retailers, foodservice distributors, wholesalers and convenience stores primarily across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, the U.K. and Ireland. Despite the strong demand experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic starting in March 2020 and continuing through the first half of fiscal 2021, the RTE cereal category had previously been experiencing weakness in recent years, and the RTE cereal category has since returned to demand levels largely in line with pre-pandemic levels. Continuing weakness in the RTE cereal category, or the weakening of our major products competing in this category, could have a material adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The loss of, a significant reduction of purchases by or the bankruptcy of a major customer may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, consolidation of our customer base, as well as competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, may hurt our volumes or profit margins. 
 A limited number of customers represents a large percentage of our consolidated net sales. Our largest customer, Walmart, accounted for 17.3 of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2023. Walmart also is the largest customer of our Post Consumer Brands segment, accounting for 32.6 of Post Consumer Brands s net sales in fiscal 2023. The largest customers of our Weetabix segment, Tesco and Asda, accounted for 28.3 of Weetabix s net sales in fiscal 2023. The largest customers of our Foodservice segment, Sysco and US Foods, accounted for 40.5 of the segment s net sales in fiscal 2023. Additionally, the largest customers of our Refrigerated Retail segment, Walmart and Kroger, accounted for 32.9 of the segment s net sales in fiscal 2023. For purposes of this risk factor, Walmart refers to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, which include Sam s Club.

Table of Cont e n t s 

 The success of our businesses depends, in part, on our ability to maintain our level of sales and product distribution through high-volume food distributors, retailers, club stores, supercenters, mass merchandisers, pet supply retailers and national restaurant chains. The competition to supply products to these high-volume customers is intense. Our customers generally are not contractually obligated to purchase from us, and they frequently reevaluate the products they carry. A decision by any of our major customers to decrease the amount of product purchased from us, including in response to shifts in consumer purchasing or traffic trends, sell another brand on an exclusive or priority basis, reduce shelf space allotted to our products, demand reduced pricing or change the manner of doing business with us could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our retail customers also may offer branded and private label products that compete directly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, there is a risk that our customers may give higher priority to their own products or to the products of our competitors. In the event of a loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction of purchases by any of our large customers or the bankruptcy or serious financial difficulty of any of our large customers, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
 Over the past several years, the retail and foodservice channels have undergone significant consolidations, and mass merchandisers and non-traditional retailers, including online food retailers and discount retailers, have been gaining market share. As this trend continues and such customers grow larger, they from time to time seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on private label and other value brands and increased promotional programs. In addition, larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories. If we are unable to respond to this environment, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if any of our existing retailer or distributor customers are consolidated with another entity and the surviving entity of any such consolidation is not a customer or decides to discontinue purchasing our products, we may lose significant amounts of our preexisting business with the acquired retailer or distributor. These consolidations also may adversely impact the ability of our smaller customers to effectively compete. The consolidation in the retail and foodservice channels also increases the risk that adverse changes to our customers business operations or financial performance could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, the traditional retail grocery outlets in the U.S. where certain of our businesses are concentrated have experienced slower growth in recent years than other retail channels, such as discount and dollar stores, direct-to-consumer brands, subscription services, club stores and eCommerce retailers. This trend accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect it to continue in the future. Our businesses may be adversely affected if such non-traditional retailers take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers, if we are unable to effectively participate in such non-traditional retail channels, if our customers fail to find ways to create digital tools and capabilities to enable them to grow their businesses or if consumer price deflation occurs as a result of this trend. 
 Our private label products may not be able to compete successfully with nationally branded products. 
 We participate in the private brand food category, producing and distributing private label products, including through our ownership interest in 8th Avenue. In many cases, competitors with nationally branded products have a competitive advantage over private label products due to name recognition. In addition, when branded competitors focus on price and promotion, the environment for private label producers and distributors becomes more challenging because the price differential between private label products and branded products may become less significant. Competitive pressures or promotions of branded products could cause us, 8th Avenue or our or 8th Avenue s customers to lose sales, which may require us or 8th Avenue to lower prices or increase the use of discounting or promotional programs, each of which could adversely affect our or 8th Avenue s margins, businesses, financial condition, results of operations, profitability and cash flows. 
 Strategic Risks 
 We may be unable to successfully integrate the Pet Food operations and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, or the parties may be unable to fulfill their obligations under agreements related to the acquisition. 
 The Pet Food acquisition involves the combination with us of a business that has operated independently of us and represents our entry into the pet food industry and category. We are devoting significant management attention and resources to integrating business practices, cultures and operations of our pre-acquisition businesses and the Pet Food operations and to offering a new platform of pet food products. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following: 
 the inability to successfully combine our pre-acquisition businesses with the Pet Food operations in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies and other benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition; 
 the challenges of providing a new offering of pet food products for which we have limited experience and of integrating complex information technology systems, operating procedures, regulatory compliance programs, technology, networks and other assets acquired as part of the Pet Food acquisition in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies; 
 24 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 potential unknown liabilities, liabilities that are significantly larger than we currently anticipate and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the Pet Food acquisition, including cash costs for integration that may exceed the cash costs that we currently anticipate; 
 our inability to comply with our obligations to manufacture certain products for The J. M. Smucker Company Smucker under a co-manufacturing agreement; 
 our dependence on Smucker to continue to manufacture certain products and to provide certain services and information, including financial information, to us for a period of time pursuant to transition services agreements and a co-manufacturing agreement; and 
 our limited post-closing indemnification or similar rights under the purchase agreement we entered into with Smucker concerning the representations and warranties Smucker made in the purchase agreement with respect to the Pet Food acquisition. No portion of the purchase price for the acquisition was held in escrow for the purpose of funding indemnifications claims, so we will have limited recourse against Smucker in the event any of the representations or warranties made by Smucker in the purchase agreement prove to be inaccurate or are breached. 
 Accordingly, the contemplated benefits of the Pet Food acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. 
 Our announced acquisition of Perfection is subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions and may not be consummated, which could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the price of our common stock. 
 On October 10, 2023, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire Perfection. Completion of this acquisition is subject to certain customary closing conditions. 
 We expect the Perfection acquisition to be completed late in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023, our first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2024. However, there can be no assurance that all closing conditions for the acquisition will be satisfied and, if they are satisfied, that they will be satisfied in time for the closing to occur during the previously referenced time frame. 
 If the Perfection acquisition is not completed, our ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected, and we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following: 
 we have dedicated significant time and resources, financial and otherwise, in planning for the acquisition and the associated integration; 
 we are responsible for certain transaction costs relating to the Perfection acquisition, whether or not the acquisition is completed; 
 we are currently dependent on Smucker to continue to manufacture certain products for a limited period of time under a co-manufacturing agreement, and without the assets and facilities we anticipate acquiring from Perfection, we will be unable to manufacture such products on our own after the expiration of the co-manufacturing agreement; 
 we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees; 
 matters relating to the acquisition (including integration planning) may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, whether or not the acquisition is completed, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us; and 
 we may be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the acquisition or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the purchase agreement. 
 If the Perfection acquisition is not completed, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as the price of our common stock. 
 Our business strategy depends upon us identifying and completing additional acquisitions and other strategic transactions. We may not be able to successfully consummate favorable strategic transactions in the future. Our corporate development activities also may have an adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Although we continuously evaluate strategic transactions, we may be unable to identify suitable strategic transactions in the future or may not be able to enter into such transactions at favorable prices or on terms that are favorable to us. Alternatively, we may in the future enter into additional strategic transactions, and any such transaction could happen at any time, could be material to our businesses and could take any number of forms, including, for example, an acquisition, investment or merger, for cash or in exchange for our equity securities, a divestiture or a joint venture. 
 Evaluating potential transactions, including divestitures and joint ventures, requires additional expenditures (including legal, accounting and due diligence expenses, higher administrative costs to support any acquired entities and information technology, 
 25 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 personnel and other integration expenses) and may divert the attention of our management from ordinary course operating matters. 
 Our corporate development activities also may present financial and operational risks and may have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. In addition, future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses, all of which could, individually or collectively, adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We may experience difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, or acquisitions may not perform as expected. 
 We have acquired multiple businesses, and we may continue to acquire other businesses, including Perfection. The successful integration of these acquisitions depends upon our ability to manage the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses. Integrating operations is complex and requires significant efforts and expenses on the part of both us and the acquired businesses. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 employees may voluntarily or involuntarily separate employment from us or the acquired businesses because of the acquisitions; 
 our management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate the acquired businesses; 
 we may encounter obstacles when incorporating the acquired businesses into our operations and management, including integrating or separating personnel, financial systems, operating procedures, regulatory compliance programs, technology, networks and other assets in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies; 
 we may encounter differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies; 
 integration may be more costly, time-consuming or complex or less effective than anticipated; 
 we may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls and procedures; and 
 we may discover previously undetected operational or other issues, such as fraud. 
 Any of these factors could adversely affect our and the acquired businesses ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies. 
 In addition, the success of these acquired businesses will depend, in part, upon our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies through the successful integration of the businesses we acquire with our pre-existing businesses. Even if we are successful in integrating acquired businesses, these integrations may not result in the realization of the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies or these benefits may not be realized within the expected time frames. In addition, acquired businesses may have unanticipated liabilities or contingencies. 
 If the transactions we undertook relating to divestitures of our interest in BellRing do not qualify for their intended tax treatment, we may incur significant tax liabilities. 
 In March 2022, we completed a series of transactions related to a divestiture of a substantial portion of our interest in BellRing, which included the BellRing Contribution, the BellRing Distribution and the Debt-for-Debt Exchange. After the BellRing Distribution, we retained 14.2 of the shares of BellRing Common Stock. During August 2022, we completed the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange. Immediately after the completion of the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange, we held 3.4 of the shares of BellRing Common Stock. During November 2022, we completed the Second Debt-for-Equity Exchange, which resulted in us no longer holding any interest in BellRing. Detailed descriptions of the transactions discussed in this risk factor are provided in Business in Item 1 of this report under the heading Recent Strategic Transactions BellRing Brands, Inc. 
 The BellRing Distribution was conditioned upon the receipt of a tax opinion from our tax advisor which concluded that the BellRing Distribution, together with certain related transactions, such as the Debt-for-Debt Exchange, the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange and the Second Debt-for-Equity Exchange, qualifies as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a) and 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the IRC and is eligible for nonrecognition within the meaning of Sections 355 and 361 of the IRC. The tax opinion was based on, among other things, then-current law and certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters and certain statements and undertakings made by us and Old BellRing. Any change in the then-current applicable law, which may or may not be retroactive, or the failure of any factual representation, assumption, statement or undertaking to be true, correct and complete in all material respects, could adversely affect the conclusions reached in the tax opinion. In addition, the tax opinion is not binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS or the courts, and the IRS and/or the courts may not agree with the tax opinion. If the BellRing Distribution, the Debt-for-Debt Exchange, the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange or the Second Debt-for-Equity Exchange do not qualify as tax-free transactions for any reason, we may 
 26 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 recognize a substantial gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Moreover, if the BellRing Distribution is determined not to qualify for nonrecognition of gain and loss under Sections 368(a) and 355 of the IRC, each of our U.S. shareholders who received shares of BellRing Common Stock in the BellRing Distribution would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of BellRing Common Stock received by such shareholder in the BellRing Distribution. In the event that one of our shareholders is treated as receiving a taxable distribution pursuant to the BellRing Distribution, the distribution to such shareholder would generally be taxable as a dividend to the extent of such shareholder s allocable share of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes). To the extent the distribution exceeds such earnings and profits, the distribution would generally constitute a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such shareholder s tax basis in its shares of Post common stock, with any remaining amount of the distribution taxed as a capital gain. 
 Pursuant to a tax matters agreement among us, BellRing and Old BellRing (the Tax Matters Agreement ), BellRing has agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from certain events, actions or inactions that BellRing takes that could affect the intended tax-free treatment of the transactions as set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement, including causing any portion of the BellRing Distribution, the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange or the Second Debt-for-Equity Exchange to be taxable to us. BellRing s indemnification obligations to us are not limited by any maximum amount and such amounts could be substantial. If BellRing were required to indemnify us under the circumstances set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement, BellRing may be subject to substantial liabilities and there is no assurance that BellRing will be able to satisfy such indemnification obligations. 
 Furthermore, pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, if and to the extent (i) the BellRing Distribution, the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange and/or the Second Debt-for-Equity Exchange do not qualify as tax-free transactions, (ii) such failure to qualify as tax-free transactions gives rise to adjustments to the tax basis of assets held by BellRing and its subsidiaries and (iii) BellRing is not required to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such failure to qualify as tax-free transactions pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, we will be entitled to periodic payments from BellRing equal to 85 of the tax savings arising from the aggregate increase to the tax basis of the assets held by BellRing and its subsidiaries resulting from such failure. Any failure by BellRing to satisfy these periodic payments, which could be substantial, could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Our Company has overlapping directors and management with BellRing and 8th Avenue, each of which may lead to conflicting interests or the appearance of conflicting interests. 
 Several of our directors and officers also serve as directors or officers of BellRing and 8th Avenue, and there are overlapping directors with such entities. Our officers and members of our Board of Directors have fiduciary duties to our shareholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at any of such other companies have fiduciary duties to that company s shareholders. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting us and one or more other companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. In addition, some of our officers or members of our Board of Directors may own equity or options to purchase equity in one or more of such other companies. Such ownership interests may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and the other companies. The appearance of conflicts of interest created by such overlapping relationships also could impair the confidence of our investors. 
 Financial Risks 
 We have substantial debt and high leverage, which could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position and could adversely affect our businesses. 
 We have a significant amount of debt. We had 6,049.6 million in aggregate principal amount of total debt as of September 30, 2023. Additionally, our secured revolving credit facility had borrowing capacity of 730.3 million at September 30, 2023 (all of which would be secured when drawn). 
 Our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could: 
 limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, for capital expenditures, for acquisitions, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; 
 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our financing arrangements; 
 trigger limitations on our ability to deduct interest paid on such indebtedness; 
 limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all; 
 negatively impact our credit ratings; 
 27 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 limit our flexibility to plan for and to adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flows to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements; 
 require us to use cash, shares of our common stock or both to settle any conversion obligations of our 2.50 convertible senior notes maturing in 2027 (the Convertible Notes ), and require us to use cash to repurchase some or all of the Convertible Notes if a fundamental change (for example, a change of control of the Company) occurs; 
 increase our vulnerability to adverse macroeconomic or industry conditions; and 
 subject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition. 
 Our ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including the impact of adverse macroeconomic conditions (including periods of inflation, rising interest rates or recessions), public health crises, potential changes in consumer and customer preferences and behaviors, the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors. If we do not generate enough cash to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt at less favorable rates, sell assets, borrow more money or issue additional equity. 
 Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks related to our debt and leverage. 
 We may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the financing arrangements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also may not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness, as defined in the documents governing our indebtedness. 
 The agreements governing our debt, including the indentures governing our senior notes, contain, or may in future financings contain, various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests, and failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our financing arrangements contain restrictions, covenants and events of default that, among other things, require us to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, to refinance our existing indebtedness and to pay dividends. Financing arrangements which we enter into in the future could contain similar restrictions and could additionally require us to comply with similar, new or additional financial tests or to maintain similar, new or additional financial ratios. The terms of our financing arrangements, financing arrangements which we enter into in the future and any future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to pay dividends, respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by limiting the amount of additional borrowings we may incur. These restrictions include compliance with, or maintenance of, certain financial tests and ratios and may limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things: 
 borrow money or guarantee debt; 
 create liens; 
 pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock or other securities; 
 make investments and acquisitions; 
 enter into or permit to exist contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; 
 enter into new lines of business; 
 enter into transactions with affiliates; and 
 sell assets or merge with other companies. 
 Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control, including the impact of adverse macroeconomic conditions (including periods of inflation, rising interest rates or recessions) and public health crises, could affect our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants. Failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants in our existing or future financing arrangements could result in a default under those arrangements and under other arrangements containing cross-default provisions. 
 28 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 Our credit agreement contains customary financial covenants, including a covenant requiring us to maintain a secured net leverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) not to exceed 4.25 to 1.00, measured as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, if, as of the last day of such fiscal quarter, the aggregate outstanding amount of all revolving credit loans, swing line loans and letter of credit obligations (subject to certain exceptions specified in our credit agreement) exceeds 30 of our revolving credit commitments. In addition to the foregoing, under the terms of Joinder Agreement No. 4 dated April 26, 2023 (the Joinder Agreement ), which provided for an incremental term loan of 400.0 million (the Fourth Incremental Term Loan under our credit agreement, so long as any principal or accrued interest remains outstanding with respect the Fourth Incremental Term Loan, we are required to comply with financial covenants consisting of the foregoing secured net leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) of not less than 2.00 to 1.00, with each such financial covenant measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. In addition, the Joinder Agreement contain certain mandatory prepayment provisions. 
 A default would permit the lenders or noteholders, as applicable, to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these arrangements and, with respect to our credit agreement, to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under our indentures and credit agreement. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. 
 Certain of our subsidiaries are not subject to the restrictive covenants in our debt, and their financial resources and assets may not be available to us to pay our obligations on our indebtedness. 
 We have designated 8th Avenue and its subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries under our credit agreement and senior note indentures. Any subsidiary that is designated as unrestricted is not a guarantor under our credit agreement or under our senior note indentures, and the assets of our unrestricted subsidiaries do not secure our obligations under our credit agreement. In addition, 8th Avenue has entered into secured credit facilities that are separate from our credit agreement and senior note indentures and that restrict, among other matters, its ability to make distributions to us or engage in transactions with us. Accordingly, the financial resources and other assets of 8th Avenue and its subsidiaries may not be available to us to pay our obligations on our indebtedness or, if available, may be significantly limited. 
 To service our indebtedness and other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends upon many factors beyond our control. 
 Our ability to pay interest on our outstanding senior notes, to fund the settlement of our Convertible Notes, to satisfy our other debt obligations and to fund any planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend in part upon the future financial and operating performance of our subsidiaries and upon our ability to renew or refinance borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the impact of periods of inflation, rising interest rates, recessions and public health crises, will affect our ability to make these payments. 
 If we are unable to make payments or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we may consider other options, including: 
 sales of assets; 
 sales of equity; 
 reductions or delays of capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments; or 
 negotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt. 
 Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to us in a sufficient amount, to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the senior notes and our other debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
 Unsuccessful implementation of business strategies to reduce costs, or unintended consequences of the implementation of such strategies, may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Many of our costs, such as raw materials, energy and freight, are impacted by factors that are outside of our control. Therefore, to offset any increases in such costs, we must seek to reduce costs in other areas, such as through operating efficiency. If we are not able to complete projects designed to reduce costs and increase operating efficiency on time or within budget, or if the implementation of these projects results in unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees or reduced productivity, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted. Labor shortages, inflation and shortages of materials have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to timely obtain equipment and materials necessary to complete planned capital projects. Future disruptions and 
 29 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 uncertainties for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives or impact our ability to complete projects to reduce costs or improve efficiency on planned timelines. If the cost-saving initiatives we have implemented, or any future cost-saving initiatives, do not generate the expected cost savings and synergies, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
 Actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance and forward-looking statements. 
 From time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance, the future performance of some or all of our unconsolidated and consolidated subsidiaries or the expected future performance of companies or businesses that we have agreed to acquire. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in such release and certain factors described in our current and periodic reports filed with the SEC. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed upon procedures with respect to the guidance, and accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The independent registered public accounting firm report included herein relates to our historical financial statements. It does not extend to any guidance and should not be read to do so. 
 Guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, although presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons. 
 Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance. Investors also should recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecasted. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it. 
 Any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the risks or uncertainties set forth in this report could result in actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material. 
 Impairment in the carrying value of intangible assets could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we will be required to record impairment charges, which may be significant. 
 Our balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships and other acquired intangibles. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows and are not amortized. Management reviews all intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. Impairments to intangible assets may be caused by factors outside of our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in industry EBITDA (which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and revenue multiples, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital (interest rates, etc.) or the bankruptcy of a significant customer. These factors, along with other internal and external factors, could have a significant negative impact on our fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge in our results of operations. In fiscal 2023, we had an impairment of goodwill and no impairments of other intangible assets. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, we had no impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets. Refer to Notes 2 and 8 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our goodwill and other intangible assets. 
 Increases in labor-related costs, including the costs of medical and other employee health and welfare benefits, may reduce our profitability. 
 Inflationary pressures, shortages in the labor market and increased competition for skilled and talented employees have increased our labor costs, which have negatively impacted our profitability, and we expect this trend to continue into fiscal 2024, although there are some economic indicators beginning to signal an alleviation of wage pressures. Although we continue to develop and enhance opportunities for efficient work processes, including using robotic technology and other artificial intelligence capabilities, an inability to automate processes in our manufacturing and distribution facilities could cause this trend of increasing labor costs to continue. Labor costs also include the costs of providing medical and other health and welfare benefits to our employees as well as certain former employees. With 11,430 employees as of November 1, 2023 (which excludes 
 30 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 the employees of our unconsolidated subsidiaries), our profitability may be substantially affected by the costs of such benefits. Although we try to control these costs, they can vary because of changes in health care laws and claims experience, which have the potential to increase the cost of providing medical and other employee health and welfare benefits. Any substantial increase in these costs could have a materially negative impact on our profitability. 
 Increases in interest rates may negatively affect earnings. 
 As of September 30, 2023, we did not have debt outstanding under our variable interest rate revolving credit facility, and we had 400.0 million of variable interest rate term loan debt and 5.3 million of municipal bond debt outstanding. We utilize derivative instruments to hedge the variable interest rate risk associated with our outstanding term loan debt. In the future, we may have additional debt outstanding with exposure to interest rate risk. As a result, we may be adversely impacted by rising interest rates. Also, at September 30, 2023, we held derivative instruments, including those hedging our variable interest rate term loan debt previously referenced, whose market values are subject to changes in the secured overnight financing rate SOFR rate. These derivative instruments have resulted, and may continue to result, in volatility in our financial results due to interest rate fluctuations. 
 The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority fully discontinued the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate LIBOR as a reference rate as of June 30, 2023. With the transition from LIBOR to SOFR as the preferred alternative to LIBOR, we have transitioned and amended our contracts to reference the SOFR rate where required. Although we have not experienced, and do not expect to experience, a material adverse impact from the transition from LIBOR to SOFR, the consequences of the transition remain uncertain at this time. 
 Volatility in the market value of derivative instruments we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates may cause volatility in our net earnings. 
 We utilize derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk for some of our principal ingredients and energy costs. In addition, from time to time, we utilize derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments, which are not designated for hedge accounting, are recognized immediately in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, resulting in volatility in our net earnings. If the fair value of these derivative instruments changes in an unpredictable or significantly favorable or unfavorable manner, we may experience material adjustments within our results of operations. Refer to Notes 2 and 13 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our derivative instruments. 
 Gains and losses related to our commodity derivative instruments are reported in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and in unallocated general corporate expenses in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are recorded within segment operating profit. Gains and losses related to our interest rate derivative instruments are reported in income/expense on swaps, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets could be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings. 
 Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our debt are based upon a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the then-current state of the economy and our industry generally. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all and result in a reduction in our liquidity. Our borrowing costs and access to capital markets also could be adversely affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade. An increase in our borrowing costs, limitations on our ability to access the global capital and credit markets or a reduction in our liquidity could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We may experience losses or be subject to increased funding and expenses to our qualified pension and other postretirement plans, which could negatively impact profits. 
 We maintain and contribute to qualified defined benefit plans in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., primarily for our Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix businesses. With respect to those plans we maintain, we are obligated to ensure that such plans are funded or paid in accordance with applicable regulations. In the event the assets in which we invest do not perform according to expectations, or the valuation of the projected benefit obligation increases due to changes in interest rates or other factors, we may be required to make significant cash contributions to these plans and recognize increased expense on our financial statements.

 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 If our products become adulterated or contaminated, or if they are misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall or withdraw those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers or their pets are injured. 
 Selling products for human and animal consumption involves a number of risks, including contamination, spoilage, degradation, tampering, allergens, mislabeling or other adulteration. Additionally, many of the ingredients used to make certain of our products, including eggs, pork, nuts, raw potatoes and grains, are vulnerable to contamination by naturally occurring molds and pathogens, such as salmonella. These pathogens may survive in our products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers. We do not have control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution or delivered. We may need to recall, withdraw or isolate some or all of our products if there is suspected or confirmed damage, adulteration, undeclared allergens, mislabeling, misbranding or other food safety concerns, whether caused by us or someone in our supply chain or distribution network. Such an incident could result in destruction of product ingredients and inventory, negative publicity, temporary plant closings, supply chain interruption, substantial costs of compliance or remediation, fines and increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. New scientific discoveries regarding ingredients, microbes and food manufacturing may bring additional risks and latent liability. Should consumption of any of our products cause illness or injury, we may be liable for monetary damages as a result of claims against us. In addition, adverse publicity, including claims, whether or not valid, that our products or ingredients are unsafe or of poor quality, may discourage consumers or customers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Although we have various insurance programs in place, any of these events or a loss of consumer or customer confidence could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Violations of laws or regulations, as well as new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations or to interpretations thereof, could adversely affect our businesses. 
 Our businesses are subject to a variety of laws and extensive regulations administered by federal, state and local government authorities for both the countries where we manufacture or license products, primarily in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., and those where we distribute products, including requirements related to food safety, quality, manufacturing, processing, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling and distribution, animal welfare, worker health and workplace safety. Changes in these legal or regulatory requirements, including new food safety requirements, revised labeling requirements for human or pet food (such as front of pack labeling requirements, changes to nutrition facts labeling and pet food label modernization), and sales or media and marketing restrictions, or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance costs and other financial obligations. In the U.S., we are regulated by, and our activities are affected by, among other federal, state and local authorities and regulations, the FDA, the USDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and California s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65). Internationally, we are regulated by, among other authorities, Health Canada, the U.K. s Food Standards Agency, Health and Safety Executive, Environment Agency, Environmental Health, the Information Commissioners Office and the Trading Standards Office and their equivalents in E.U. member states. We also are regulated by similar authorities elsewhere in the world where our products are distributed or licensed. Certain of our businesses are subject to heightened regulations. Specifically, certain of our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail businesses products are subject to continuous on-site inspections by the USDA. Such heightened regulatory scrutiny results in increased costs of operations and the potential for delays in product sales. In addition, there is some risk that product classifications could be changed by the regulators, which could result in significant fines, penalties, discontinued distribution and relabeling costs. 
 Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, tariffs, import and export restrictions, healthcare costs, energy sourcing and usage, environmental and sustainability actions and disclosures, competition, data privacy and security and related disclosures, immigration and labor issues, governmental assistance programs and incentives (as examples, the discontinuation of the heightened Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits that were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, which occurred during, and adversely impacted us in, fiscal 2023, and the resumption of student loan repayments that were temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic, which occurred in October 2023) and other regulatory reforms, any or all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our businesses or the businesses of our customers, suppliers or third-party manufacturers. In addition, we could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations and may be subject to initiatives to limit or prohibit the marketing and advertising of our products to children or products containing certain ingredients. We also may be impacted by changes to administrative policies, such as business restrictions, tariffs and trade agreements, in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products. 
 The impact of current laws and regulations, changes in these laws or regulations or interpretations thereof or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers, suppliers or third-party manufacturers, causing our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to be adversely affected. As specific examples, some states have passed laws or enacted regulations, or may do so in the future, that mandate specific housing requirements for layer hens and mandate specific space requirements for farm animal enclosures, including layer hens and pigs, which have resulted, and may in the future result, in us incurring additional operating and capital costs. In addition, there is an 
 32 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 increased focus by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to packaging, environmental contaminants, climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and mandatory disclosures related to such topics. Compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements may require us to make significant changes to our business operations, strategy, supply chain management and disclosures, which will likely require substantial time, attention and costs. The limited availability of government inspectors due to a government shutdown, government restrictions, public health crises or closed borders also could cause disruption to our manufacturing facilities. A government shutdown also could impact our ability to receive governmental approvals necessary for our businesses, such as labeling of new products. 
 It is possible that federal, state, local or foreign enforcement authorities might take regulatory or enforcement action, which could result in significant fines or penalties and revocations of required licenses or injunctions, as well as potential criminal sanctions. Even if we make changes to align ourselves with changing legal or regulatory requirements, we may still be subject to significant penalties if such laws and regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices. If we are found to be significantly out of compliance with applicable laws, regulations or permits, an enforcement authority could issue a warning letter, institute enforcement actions or both, which could result in additional costs, product detentions, substantial delays in production or even a temporary shutdown in manufacturing and product sales while the non-conformances are rectified. Also, we may have to recall product or otherwise remove product from the market and temporarily cease its manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Any claims, such as product liability or labeling claims, resulting from the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations would be expensive to defend and could result in substantial damage awards against us or harm our reputation. Any of these events would negatively impact our revenues and costs of operations. 
 Pending and future litigation may impair our reputation or cause us to incur significant costs. 
 We are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to contracts, intellectual property, product recalls, product liability, the advertising, marketing, labeling or certification of products, employment matters, environmental matters, data privacy or security or other aspects of our business. Over the past several years, there has been an increase in lawsuits filed against food and beverage companies, as well as pet food companies, alleging deceptive advertising and labeling. Negative publicity resulting from allegations made in lawsuits or claims asserted against us, whether or not valid, may adversely affect our reputation or brands. In addition, we may incur substantial costs and fees in defending such actions or asserting our rights, be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The outcome of pending or future litigation is often difficult to predict and may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Although we have various insurance programs in place, the potential liabilities associated with these litigation matters, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. In addition, insurance carriers may seek to rescind or deny coverage with respect to pending or future claims or lawsuits. If we do not have sufficient coverage under our policies, or if coverage is denied, we may be required to make material payments to settle litigation or satisfy any judgment. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws can adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We are subject to an evolving body of federal, state and foreign laws, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding personal information, data privacy, data protection and data security. Such laws, regulations, guidelines and principles impose varying obligations and requirements from country to country or, within the U.S., from state to state, which can create complexity in our compliance efforts. Our efforts to comply with such requirements, including the General Data Protection Regulation, the E.U. s retained law version of the General Data Protection Regulation and the E.U.-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the California Consumer Privacy Act (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act), require significant time and resources and impose significant challenges that are likely to continue to increase over time, particularly as additional jurisdictions adopt similar requirements. In addition, if a state or other jurisdiction where we have substantial operations were to adopt new requirements, we could incur substantial compliance costs. Failure to comply with these requirements or to otherwise protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing could result in substantial penalties or fines, regulatory proceedings, litigation and damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 We are subject to certain continuing obligations, including indemnification obligations and lease guarantor obligations, related to the sale of the Bob Evans restaurants business that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In April 2017, prior to our acquisition of Bob Evans, Bob Evans completed the sale and separation of its restaurants business (the Bob Evans Restaurants Transaction to Bob Evans Restaurants, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed by affiliates of Golden Gate Capital Opportunity Fund, L.P. (the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer ), pursuant to a sale agreement between Bob Evans and the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer (the sale agreement, together with agreements related thereto, collectively referred to as the Restaurants Sale Agreement ). As a result of our acquisition of Bob Evans, we have the obligation to indemnify the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer for certain breaches of the Restaurants Sale Agreement and certain other liabilities set forth in the Restaurants Sale Agreement. 
 In addition, in connection with the Bob Evans Restaurants Transaction, the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer assumed the lease obligations of the Bob Evans restaurants business. However, as part of a sale leaseback transaction of 143 of Bob Evans s restaurant properties that Bob Evans completed in 2016, Bob Evans and one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into payment and performance guarantees relating to the leases on such restaurant properties (the Guarantees ), which remained in place after the completion of the Bob Evans Restaurants Transaction. The Guarantees have subsequently been adjusted to 130 properties. Although the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer assumed responsibility for the payment and performance obligations under the leases on the sale leaseback properties, under the terms of the Guarantees, we remain liable for payments due under any of the leases that remain in place if the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer fails to satisfy its lease obligations where we do not otherwise have adequate defenses under the Guarantees, the lease agreements or applicable law. Any such unexpected expenses related to our obligations under the Guarantees or under the Restaurants Sale Agreement could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands. 
 We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and licenses, to be a significant and valuable asset to us. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as exclusive and nonexclusive licensing agreements, third-party nondisclosure, confidentiality and assignment agreements, confidentiality provisions in third-party agreements and the policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure or inability to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our businesses. In addition, as certain of our trademarks, trade names and trade secrets are subject to licenses and are shared and used by third parties, negative events outside of our control could have an adverse impact on us and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be costly and time-consuming to defend; cause us to cease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; require us to redesign or rebrand our products or packaging, if feasible; divert management s attention and resources; or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party s intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, a successful claim of infringement against us could require us to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements or stop the sale of certain products, any or all of which could have a negative impact on our operating profits and harm our future prospects. 
 Termination of our material intellectual property licenses could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. 
 We market certain of our products in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and several other locations pursuant to intellectual property license agreements. These licenses give us the right to use certain names, characters and logos in connection with our products and to sell the products in certain regions. If we were to breach any material term of these license agreements and not timely cure the breach, the licensor could terminate the agreement. If the licensor were to terminate our rights to use the names, characters and logos for this reason or any other reason, or if a licensor decided not to renew a license agreement upon the expiration of the license term, the loss of such rights could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. 
 We are subject to environmental laws and regulations that can impose significant costs and expose us to potential financial liabilities. 
 We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those limiting the discharge and release of pollutants into the environment and those regulating the transport, storage, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous wastes. Certain environmental laws and regulations can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties, including past and present owners 
 34 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 and operators of sites, related to cleaning up sites at which hazardous materials were disposed of or released. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in severe fines and penalties by governments or courts of law and could result in negative publicity. In addition, future laws may more stringently regulate environmental matters, including greenhouse gas emissions, water use and wastewater management. 
 Future events, such as new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations, new environmental claims, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions requiring response action or more vigorous interpretations or enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations, might require us to incur increased costs, capital expenditures or other financial obligations that could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Missouri law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock. 
 Our amended and restated articles of incorporation (as amended, the articles of incorporation ), our amended and restated bylaws (the bylaws and Missouri law contain provisions intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive and incentivizing prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others: 
 our Board of Directors is divided into three classes with staggered terms; 
 our Board of Directors fixes the number of members on the Board of Directors; 
 elimination of the rights of our shareholders to act by written consent (except when such consent is unanimous) and to call shareholder meetings; 
 rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings; 
 the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval; 
 supermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our articles of incorporation; 
 anti-takeover provisions of Missouri law which may prevent us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder, or which may deter third parties from acquiring amounts of our common stock above certain thresholds; and 
 limitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Changes in tax laws may adversely affect us, and the IRS, another taxing authority or a court may disagree with our tax positions, which may result in adverse effects on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant changes. There can be no assurance that future tax law changes will not increase the rate of the corporate income tax significantly; impose new limitations on deductions, credits or other tax benefits; or make other changes that may adversely affect the performance of an investment in us. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the IRS, another taxing authority or a court will agree with the positions taken by us, in which case tax penalties and interest may be imposed that could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, including value added tax, or other changes in the application of existing taxes, in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 The market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile. 
 The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks and uncertainties discussed in this report, announcements we make about our businesses, variations in our quarterly results of operations and those of our competitors, market data that is available to subscribers, reports by industry analysts, whether or not we meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow us, industry or market trends, investor perceptions, actions by credit rating agencies, future issuances or sales of our common stock, to the extent any Convertible Notes are converted into shares of our common stock or cash or negative developments relating to our customers, competitors or suppliers, as well as general economic and industry conditions, including periods of inflation, rising interest rates or recessions. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. 
 As a result of such events or market volatility, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchase our common stock. In addition, this market volatility may impact our ability to raise 
 35 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 capital through sales of our equity securities and may adversely affect the retentive power of our equity compensation plans, Further, in the past, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits. The filing of a lawsuit against us, regardless of the outcome, could have a negative effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources. 
 If we are unable to continue to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned, and our stock price may suffer. 
 Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 SOX requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to perform a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue an opinion on its audit of our internal control over financial reporting. 
 The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the annual deadline imposed by SOX. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may consequently suffer. In addition, in the event that we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we might fail to timely prevent or detect potential financial misstatements. As discussed under the heading Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 9A of this report, and subject to the permitted exclusion of certain elements of internal controls of Pet Food noted therein, as of September 30, 2023, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 A shareholder s percentage ownership in Post may be diluted in the future. 
 As with any publicly-traded company, our shareholders percentage ownership in Post may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors, officers and employees and the vesting of those equity awards. For a brief discussion of our equity incentive plan, see Note 19 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. In addition, any Convertible Notes converted into shares of our common stock will dilute the ownership of our then existing shareholders. 
 Actions of shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management s attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our businesses. 
 From time to time, we may be subject to proposals and other requests from shareholders urging us to take certain corporate actions, including proposals seeking to influence our corporate policies or effecting a change in our management. In the event of such shareholder proposals, particularly with respect to matters which our management and Board of Directors, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our businesses could be adversely affected because responding to actions and requests of shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees, business partners and customers.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of Post Holdings, Inc. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements under Item 8 of this report and the Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements on page 1 of this report. The terms our, we, us, Company and Post as used herein refer to Post Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 The following should be read in conjunction with the discussion and analysis of our fiscal 2022 results compared to our fiscal 2021 results, including any related discussion of fiscal 2021 results and activity, which can be found in Item 7 under the title Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, and such discussion and analysis is incorporated by reference herein. 
 On March 10, 2022, we completed the BellRing Spin-off (as defined below), which represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and consolidated financial results. Accordingly, the historical results of BellRing Intermediate Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Brands, Inc.) Old BellRing and BellRing Distribution, LLC prior to the BellRing Spin-off have been presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following discussion reflects continuing operations only, unless otherwise indicated. See below for additional information. 
 OVERVIEW 
 We are a consumer packaged goods holding company, operating in four reportable segments: Post Consumer Brands, Weetabix, Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail. Our products are sold through a variety of channels, including grocery, club and drug stores, mass merchandisers, foodservice, food ingredient and eCommerce. 
 At September 30, 2023, our reportable segments were as follows: 
 Post Consumer Brands: North American ready-to-eat RTE cereal, pet food and nut butters; 
 Weetabix: primarily United Kingdom (the U.K. RTE cereal, muesli and protein-based shakes; 
 Foodservice: primarily egg and potato products; and 
 Refrigerated Retail: primarily side dish, egg, cheese and sausage products. 
 Transactions 
 Post Holdings Partnering Corporation 
 In May and June 2021, we and Post Holdings Partnering Corporation PHPC ), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the initial public offering of 34.5 million units of PHPC (the PHPC Units and such transaction, the PHPC IPO ), of which our wholly-owned subsidiary PHPC Sponsor purchased 4.0 million PHPC Units. Each PHPC Unit consisted of one share of Series A common stock of PHPC PHPC Series A Common Stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock at an exercise price of 11.50 per share (the PHPC Warrants ). The PHPC Units were sold at a price of 10.00 per PHPC Unit, generating gross proceeds to PHPC of 345.0 million. Under the terms of the PHPC IPO, PHPC was required to consummate a partnering transaction by May 28, 2023, which could have been extended to August 28, 2023 in certain circumstances (the Combination Period ). 
 Substantially concurrently with the closing of the PHPC IPO, PHPC completed the private sale of 1.1 million units of PHPC (the PHPC Private Placement Units ), at a purchase price of 10.00 per PHPC Private Placement Unit, to PHPC Sponsor, generating proceeds to PHPC of 10.9 million (the PHPC Private Placement ). Each PHPC Private Placement Unit consisted of one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant of PHPC to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock at an exercise price of 11.50 per share (the PHPC Private Placement Warrants ). 
 In addition, we, through PHPC Sponsor s ownership of 8.6 million shares of Series F common stock of PHPC (the PHPC Series F Common Stock ), had certain governance rights in PHPC relating to the election of PHPC directors and voting rights on amendments to PHPC s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 
 In connection with the PHPC IPO, PHPC incurred offering costs of 17.9 million, of which 10.7 million were deferred underwriting commissions that would have become payable to the underwriters solely in the event that PHPC completed a partnering transaction and were included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2022. 
 Pr oceeds of 345.0 million were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of PHPC s public stockholders, which consisted of certain proceeds from the PHPC IPO and certain proceeds from the PHPC Private Placement, net of underwriters discounts and commissions and other costs and expenses. A minimum balance of 345.0 million , which 
 40 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 represented the number of PHPC Units sold at the offering price of 10.00 per PHPC Unit , was required by the underwriting agreement to be maintained in the trust account. These pr oceeds were invested only in United States U.S. treasury securities . At September 30, 2022, there was 346.8 million held in the trust account, which was included in Investments held in trust on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The public stockholders ownership of PHPC equity represented a noncontrolling interest NCI to us, which was classified outside of permanent shareholders equity as the PHPC Series A Common Stock was redeemable at the option of the public stockholders in certain circumstances. As of September 30, 2022, the carrying amount of the redeemable NCI was recorded at its redemption value of 306.6 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 As of September 30, 2022 and prior to the PHPC Redemption (as defined below), we beneficially owned 31.0 of the equity of PHPC and the net earnings and net assets of PHPC were consolidated within our financial statements. The remaining 69.0 of the consolidated net earnings and net assets of PHPC, which represented the percentage of economic interest in PHPC held by the public stockholders of PHPC through their ownership of PHPC equity, were allocated to redeemable NCI. All transactions between PHPC and PHPC Sponsor, as well as related financial statement impacts, eliminated in consolidation. 
 On May 11, 2023, PHPC announced that it would not complete a partnering transaction within the Combination Period and that the entity would liquidate and dissolve in accordance with the terms of its amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Subsequent to the decision to liquidate and dissolve, PHPC completed certain winding-up activities, which included writing-off the deferred underwriting commissions as the underwriters agreed to waive their rights to these amounts should a partnering transaction not occur. We recorded a 10.7 million gain in connection with this write-off, which was recorded in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 On May 28, 2023, the PHPC Warrants and the PHPC Private Placement Warrants expired worthless, as PHPC had not completed a partnering transaction before the expiration of the Combination Period. 
 On May 30, 2023, PHPC redeemed all of the outstanding public shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock (the PHPC Redemption ). Each share of PHPC Series A Common Stock was redeemed for approximately 10.24 per share, representing the per share price equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the trust account not previously released to pay taxes or dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock. In connection with the PHPC Redemption: 
 353.4 million of funds held in the trust account immediately prior to the PHPC Redemption were distributed to redeem all of the outstanding shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock, which reduced Investments held in trust on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to zero as of September 30, 2023. We received 40.9 million from the PHPC Redemption related to our ownership of 4.0 million shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock; and 
 redeemable NCI of 312.5 million immediately prior to the PHPC Redemption was reduced to zero on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023. 
 Subsequent to the PHPC Redemption, PHPC delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE and dissolved in June 2023, and all classes of shares of PHPC equity were cancelled, including the PHPC Private Placement Units and the shares of PHPC Series F Common Stock, which were surrendered by PHPC Sponsor for no consideration. PHPC Sponsor subsequently dissolved in August 2023. 
 BellRing Brands, Inc. 
 On March 9, 2022, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 26, 2021 (as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 28, 2022, the Spin-off Agreement ), by and among us, Old BellRing, BellRing Brands, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Distribution, LLC) BellRing and BellRing Merger Sub Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing BellRing Merger Sub ), we contributed our share of Old BellRing Class B common stock, 0.01 par value per share, all of our BellRing Brands, LLC non-voting membership units and 550.4 million of cash to BellRing in exchange for certain limited liability company interests of BellRing and the right to receive 840.0 million in aggregate principal amount of BellRing s 7.00 senior notes maturing in 2030 (the BellRing Notes, and such transactions, collectively, the BellRing Contribution ). 
 On March 10, 2022, BellRing converted into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to BellRing Brands, Inc. , and we distributed an aggregate of 78.1 million, or 80.1 , of our shares of BellRing common stock, 0.01 par value per share BellRing Common Stock ), to our shareholders of record as of the close of business, Central Time, on February 25, 2022 (the Record Date in a pro-rata distribution (the BellRing Distribution ). Our shareholders received 1.267788 shares of BellRing Common Stock for every one share of our common stock held as of the Record Date. No fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock were issued, and instead, cash in lieu of any fractional shares was paid to our shareholders. 
 Upon completion of the BellRing Distribution, BellRing Merger Sub merged with and into Old BellRing (the BellRing Merger ), with Old BellRing continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing.

 The transactions described above, including the BellRing Contribution, the BellRing Distribution and the BellRing Merger, and the Debt-for-Debt Exchange described under Liquidity and Capital Resources within this section, are collectively referred to as the BellRing Spin-off. 
 Our equity interest in BellRing subsequent to the BellRing Spin-off (our Investment in BellRing was 14.2 immediately following the BellRing Spin-off. As a result of the BellRing Spin-off, the dual class voting structure in the BellRing business was eliminated. The BellRing Distribution was structured in a manner intended to qualify as a tax-free distribution to our shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except to the extent of any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock. 
 On August 11, 2022, we transferred 14.8 million shares of our Investment in BellRing to repay certain outstanding debt obligations as part of the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources within this section). 
 On November 25, 2022, we transferred the remaining 4.6 million shares of our Investment in BellRing to repay certain outstanding debt obligations as part of the Second Debt-for-Equity Exchange (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources within this section). We owned no shares of BellRing Common Stock as of September 30, 2023. 
 We incurred separation-related expenses of 0.1 million and 29.9 million during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to the BellRing Spin-off and subsequent divestment of our Investment in BellRing. These expenses generally included third-party costs for advisory services, fees charged by other service providers and government filing fees and were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Divestitures 
 We completed the sale of the Willamette Egg Farms business (the WEF Transaction on December 1, 2021. Prior to the WEF Transaction, Willamette Egg Farms operating results were reported in our Refrigerated Retail segment. 
 Market and Company Trends 
 Our Company, as well as the consumer packaged goods industry in which we operate, have been impacted by the following trends which have impacted our results of operations and may continue to impact our results of operations in the future, including: 
 inflationary pressures, which have driven increased input costs and therefore pricing actions within each of our respective segments (refer to Commodity Trends and Seasonality section below); 
 shifting consumer preferences from branded to private label or other value products as consumers continue to be impacted by rising costs, which has negatively impacted sales volumes within our Refrigerated Retail, Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments and driven shifts in product mix toward lower margin products within our Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments; and 
 outbreaks of avian influenza during fiscal 2022 and early fiscal 2023, which impacted our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments, and drove increased costs related to production inefficiencies, egg supply constraints and higher market-based egg prices, all of which were mitigated through volume management with customers and pricing actions.

 Net Sales 
 Net sales increased 1,139.8 million, or 19 , during the year ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the prior year. This increase was due to higher net sales within our Post Consumer Brands, Foodservice and Weetabix segments, partially offset by lower net sales in our Refrigerated Retail segment. For further discussion, refer to Segment Results within this section. 
 Operating Profit 
 Operating profit increased 183.3 million, or 44 , during the year ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by higher segment profit within our Foodservice, Post Consumer Brands and Refrigerated Retail segments, partially offset by a goodwill impairment charge of 42.2 million related to our Cheese and Dairy reporting unit, lower segment profit within our Weetabix segment and increased general corporate expenses. For further discussion, refer to Segment Results within this section. 
 Interest Expense, net 
 Interest expense decreased 38.7 million, or 12 , for the year ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower average outstanding principal amounts of debt, increased interest income primarily on our investments held in trust prior to the PHPC Redemption and a lower weighted-average interest rate when compared to fiscal 2022. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total outstanding debt was 4.9 and 5.0 for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 (Gain) Loss on Extinguishment of Debt, net

The net gain primarily related to the partial repurchase of our 4.50 senior notes and our 4.625 senior notes. The net gain included debt discounts received of 42.9 million and the write-off of unamortized premiums of 0.9 million, partially offset by the write-off of debt issuance costs of 3.3 million related to our senior notes and our Third Incremental Term Loan (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources within this section).

Table of Cont e n t s 

 During the year ended September 30, 2022, we recognized a net gain of 72.6 million related to the extinguishment of debt. The net gain primarily related to the partial repurchase of our 4.50 senior notes, our 4.625 senior notes and our 5.50 senior notes, partially offset by a net loss related to the partial redemption of our 5.75 senior notes. The net gain included net debt discounts received of 73.7 million and the write-off of unamortized premiums of 15.3 million, partially offset by the write-off of debt issuance costs and tender fees of 16.4 million related to our senior notes, our First Incremental Term Loan and our Second Incremental Term Loan (as such terms are defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources within this section.

For additional information on our Investment in BellRing, refer to Notes 4, 5 and 16 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 In fiscal 2022, our effective income tax rate differed significantly from the statutory rate primarily as a result of (i) a 91.8 million tax-effected benefit from the non-cash realized and unrealized book gains on our Investment in BellRing, which was divested in a manner intended to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (ii) 14.1 million of discrete income tax benefit items related to our equity method loss attributable to 8th Avenue Food Provisions, Inc. 8th Avenue ).

 SEGMENT RESULTS 
 We evaluate each segment s performance based on its segment profit, which for all segments is its earnings/loss before income taxes and equity method earnings/loss before impairment of property, goodwill and other intangible assets, facility closure related costs, restructuring expenses, gain/loss on assets and liabilities held for sale, gain/loss on sale of businesses and facilities, interest expense and other unallocated corporate income and expenses. The discussion of Post Consumer Brands segment profit below includes segment profit attributable to Pet Food, as it is impracticable to separately present due to the level of integration of Pet Food within the Post Consumer Brands segment.

 12 14 
 Net sales for the Post Consumer Brands segment increased 790.4 million, or 35 , for the year ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the inclusion of five months of Pet Food net sales of 679.8 million. The remaining increase was driven by higher average net selling prices primarily due to increased pricing taken to mitigate inflation. Excluding Pet Food, pricing increases were partially offset by a volume decline of 5 and unfavorable product mix as branded cereal volumes declined, partially offset by increased private label cereal volumes. 
 Segment profit for the year ended September 30, 2023 increased 64.2 million, or 20 , when compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales, as previously discussed, partially offset by higher product costs, which included five months of incremental costs attributable to Pet Food of 503.0 million, raw material inflation of 116.7 million and higher manufacturing costs of 65.5 million, partially offset by lower freight costs of 27.7 million. In addition, employee-related expenses, integration costs, advertising and consumer spending and amortization expense increased compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of five months of Pet Food expenses.

 Net sales for the Weetabix segment increased 34.8 million, or 7 , for the year ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and six incremental months of net sales of 14.2 million attributable to our prior year acquisition of Lacka Foods, net sales increased 42.7 million, or 9 , on 1 lower volumes. The increase in net sales was driven by higher average net selling prices primarily due to list price increases, partially offset by a shift in product mix towards private label products and increased promotional spending. Volumes declined 1 , driven by volume decreases in branded products, partially offset by increases in private label products. 
 Segment profit decreased 35.6 million, or 33 , for the year ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, segment profit decreased 32.3 million, or 30 . This decrease was primarily driven by raw material inflation of 33.4 million and higher manufacturing costs of 13.1 million, partially offset by higher net sales, as previously discussed.

 Net sales for the Foodservice segment increased 330.9 million, or 16 , for the year ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by higher average net selling prices during the current year and the lapping of lower product demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year. Egg product sales were up 289.6 million, or 16 , with volume up 4 , driven by price increases taken to mitigate cost inflation as well as the pass-through of increased grain and egg market prices. Egg volumes increased due to distribution gains in the foodservice channel, partially offset by lower food ingredient volume. Sales of side dishes were up 55.0 million, or 27 , with volume up 7 , driven by price increases taken to mitigate inflation and volume increases as a result of distribution gains. Sales of other products were down 13.7 million. 
 Segment profit increased 198.5 million, or 131 , for the year ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the prior year, driven by higher net sales, as previously discussed, lower freight costs of 31.7 million and lapping a provision for legal settlement and related legal fees of 18.2 million in the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by raw material inflation of 140.1 million, primarily driven by higher egg raw material costs due to unfavorable grain and egg market prices and higher potato raw material costs, increased employee-related expenses of 6.6 million, increased manufacturing costs of 6.5 million and higher warehousing costs of 5.2 million.

 Net sales for the Refrigerated Retail segment decreased 16.9 million, or 2 , for the year ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the prior year. Net sales for the year ended September 30, 2023 were impacted by the absence of net sales as a result of the WEF Transaction. Excluding this impact, net sales decreased 9.8 million, or 1 , driven by 7 lower volumes primarily due to price elasticities and a shift towards private label products. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher average net selling prices compared to the prior year primarily due to price increases taken to mitigate input cost inflation, partially offset by increased promotional spending. Cheese and other dairy product sales were down 22.8 million, or 11 , with volume down 16 , and were additionally impacted by distribution losses. Egg product sales were down 4.6 million, or 2 , on 12 lower volumes, and were additionally impacted by avian influenza-related supply constraints. Sausage sales declined 1.9 million, or 1 , with volume down 1 . Sales of side dishes increased 24.7 million, or 6 , with volume down 4 . Sales of other products were down 5.2 million. 
 Segment profit increased 12.1 million, or 21 , for the year ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by higher average net selling prices, as previously discussed, and lower freight costs of 8.0 million. These positive impacts were partially offset by raw material inflation of 17.9 million, increased advertising and consumer spending of 13.6 million, lower net sales volume, as previously discussed, and higher employee-related costs.

 General corporate expenses and other 222.7 196.8 25.9 13 
 General corporate expenses and other increased 25.9 million, or 13 , during the year ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the prior year. T he current year included 12.0 million of restructuring and facility closure costs, including accelerated depreciation, incurred by our Refrigerated Retail, Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments. The prior year included 11.1 million of restructuring and facility closure costs incurred by our Post Consumer Brands and Foodservice segments, a loss on sale of business of 6.3 million related to the WEF Transaction and a gain on assets held for sale of 9.4 million related to the sale of equipment in Klingerstown, Pennsylvania within our Foodservice segment. Excluding these impacts, general corporate expenses and other increased 21.9 million. This increase was driven by higher employee-related expenses of 19.6 million, higher a cquisition-related costs of 14.6 million primarily related to Pet Food, increased mark-to-market adjustments and impairments on equity securities and investments of 14.5 million and increased net losses related to mark-to-market adjustments on economic hedges and warrant liabilities of 6.9 million. These negative impacts were partially offset by decreased separation-related expenses of 29.8 million in connection with the BellRing Spin-off and a gain related to the write-off of deferred underwriting commissions of 10.7 million in connection with the PHPC Redemption.

 Impairment of Goodwill 
 During the year ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 42.2 million related to our Cheese and Dairy reporting unit, which is reported in our Refrigerated Retail segment.

 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Historically, we have generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations. We believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and current and possible future credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, purchase commitments, interest payments, research and development activities, capital expenditures, pension contributions and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact meeting our capital needs during or beyond the next twelve months. Our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions, competitive pressures and other business risk factors. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and cash on hand to satisfy our cash needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or are otherwise unable to comply with the terms of our credit facilities, we may be required to seek additional financing alternatives, which may require waivers under our Credit Agreement and our indentures governing our senior notes, in order to generate additional cash. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain additional financing or any such waivers on terms acceptable to us or at all. For additional information on our debt, refer to Note 16 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 Short-term financing needs primarily consist of working capital requirements and interest payments on our long-term debt. Long-term financing needs will depend largely on potential growth opportunities, including acquisition activity and other strategic transactions and repayment or refinancing of our long-term debt obligations. We may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Additionally, we may seek to repurchase shares of our common stock. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 Obligations under our Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by our existing and subsequently acquired or organized subsidiaries (other than immaterial subsidiaries, certain excluded subsidiaries and subsidiaries we designate as unrestricted subsidiaries, which include 8th Avenue and its subsidiaries) and are secured by security interests in substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiary guarantors, but excluding, in each case, real property. These guarantees are subject to release in certain circumstances. 
 Our senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries, other than immaterial subsidiaries, certain excluded

 subsidiaries and subsidiaries we designate as unrestricted subsidiaries, which include 8th Avenue and its subsidiaries. These guarantees are subject to release in certain circumstances. 
 Our 2.50 convertible senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our existing domestic subsidiaries that have guaranteed our other senior notes, which excludes certain immaterial subsidiaries, certain excluded subsidiaries and subsidiaries we designate as unrestricted subsidiaries under our other senior notes indentures, which include 8th Avenue and its subsidiaries. If, after the date our 2.50 convertible senior notes were issued, any domestic wholly-owned subsidiary guarantees any of our existing senior notes or any other debt securities we may issue in the form of senior unsecured notes or convertible or exchangeable notes, then we must cause such subsidiary to become a guarantor under the 2.50 convertible senior notes as well. 
 Cash Requirements 
 Our cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include: 
 Debt and interest obligations See Note 16 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for information on our debt and the timing of future principal and interest payments. For information on our interest rate swaps that require monthly settlements, see Note 13 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 Purchase obligations Purchase obligations are legally binding agreements to purchase goods, services or equipment that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and/or penalties imposed for failing to meet contracted minimum purchase quantities (such as take-or-pay contracts); fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The Company has long-term ingredient, packaging, utility and information technology commitments used to support our various businesses for periods up to fiscal 2034. Minimum amounts committed to as of September 30, 2023 were 4,511.1 million (with 1,925.2 million due in fiscal 2024), primarily related to long-term egg contracts, open purchase orders and accrued capital expenditures. 
 Leases See Note 15 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for information on our lease obligations and the amount and timing of future payments. 
 Pension and other postretirement benefit obligations See Note 18 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for information on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the amount and timing of future payments. 
 Other liabilities Other liabilities include obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, payments for workers compensation, general liability and auto liability claim losses, unrecognized tax benefits and various other long-term liabilities, all of which have some inherent uncertainty as to the amount and timing of payments and were reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023. 
 On October 7, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Perfection Pet Foods, LLC Perfection for 235.0 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Perfection is a manufacturer and packager of private label and co-manufactured pet food and baked treat products. The acquisition is expected to close in our first quarter of fiscal 2024, and we plan to use a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility to fund the purchase price.

 Operating Activities - Continuing Operations 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2023 increased 366.1 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2022, primarily driven by higher operating profit, cash inflows related to fluctuations in the timing of sales and collections of trade receivables at our Post Consumer Brands and Foodservice segments (compared to cash outflows in fiscal 2022), lower interest payments of 19.8 million and lower net payments on our interest rate swaps of 16.9 million. These impacts were partially offset by cash outflows related to fluctuations in the timing of purchases and payments of trade payables at our Post Consumer Brands and Foodservice segments (compared to cash inflows in fiscal 2022) and higher tax payments of 68.9 million. 
 Investing Activities - Continuing Operations 
 Fiscal 2023 
 Cash used in investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2023 was 669.3 million, primarily driven by net cash payments of 715.2 million related to the Pet Food acquisition and capital expenditures of 303.0 million. Capital expenditures in the period primarily related to ongoing projects in ou r Post Consumer Brands and Foodservice segments. These cash outflows were partially offset by a return of 345.0 million in connection with the PHPC Redemption which had been deposited in a trust account in connection with the PHPC IPO and the PHPC Private Placement. 
 Fiscal 2022 
 Cash used in investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2022 was 220.2 million. The cash outflow during the year ended September 30, 2022 was driven by capital expenditures of 255.3 million, net cash payments of 24.8 million primarily related to our acquisition of Lacka Foods and cash paid related to investments in partnerships of 9.0 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a business (related to the WEF Transaction) of 50.5 million and proceeds from the sale of property and assets held for sale of 18.0 million. Capital expenditures in the period were primarily driven by ongoing projects in our Post Consumer Brands and Foodservice segments. 
 Financing Activities - Continuing Operations 
 Fiscal 2023 
 Cash used in financing activities was 555.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. We received proceeds of 400.0 million and 130.0 million from our Fourth Incremental Term Loan and our Third Incremental Term Loan, respectively. The Third Incremental Term Loan was partially repaid through the Second Debt-for-Equity Exchange, and the remaining principal balance of 30.1 million was repaid using cash on hand. In addition, we repaid 318.6 million principal value of our 4.50 , 4.625 and 5.625 senior notes, net of 42.9 million of discounts, and 1.1 million principal value of our municipal bond, which resulted in total net repayments of debt of 306.9 million. We distributed 312.5 million to PHPC public stockholders in connection with the PHPC Redemption. We paid 387.1 million, including broker s commissions, for repurchases of shares of our common stock and 43.5 million related to the termination of certain of our rate-lock interest rate swap contracts, which contained non-cash, off-market financing elements. 
 Fiscal 2022 
 Cash used in financing activities was 237.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. We paid 550.4 million of cash to BellRing in connection with the BellRing Spin-off, which was partially offset by cash receipts from BellRing of 3.2 million prior to the BellRing Spin-off related to quarterly tax distributions pursuant to BellRing Brands, LLC s amended and restated limited liability company agreement. We received proceeds of 840.0 million from our First Incremental Term Loan, which were used to repay 840.0 million principal value of our 5.75 senior notes. We received proceeds of 450.0 million from our Second Incremental Term Loan. The Second Incremental Term Loan was partially repaid through the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange and the remaining principal balance of 107.7 million was repaid using cash on hand. We repaid 712.3 million principal value of our 4.50 , 4.625 and 5.50 senior notes, net of 97.8 million in discounts. These repayments, combined with a principal payment of 1.1 million on a municipal bond, resulted in total net repayments of long-term debt of 1,563.3 million. In connection with the repayment of the 5.75 senior notes (discussed above), we paid 24.1 million in debt premiums. We received proceeds of 500.0 million and a premium of 17.5 million from our additional 5.50 senior notes issuance. We received proceeds of 575.0 million from our 2.50 convertible senior notes issuance. We paid 26.4 million in debt issuance costs and deferred financing fees primarily in connection with our additional 5.50 senior notes issuance, our 2.50 convertible senior notes issuance, our First Incremental Term Loan, our Second Incremental Term Loan and the amendment of our Credit Agreement. We paid 443.0 million, including broker s commissions, for repurchases of shares of our common stock, which included repurchases of shares of our common stock that were accrued at September 30, 2021 and did not settle until fiscal 2022.

 Debt Covenants 
 Credit Agreement 
 Under the terms of our Credit Agreement, we are required to comply with a financial covenant consisting of a secured net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) not to exceed 4.25 to 1.00, measured as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, if, as of the last day of such fiscal quarter, the aggregate outstanding amount of all revolving credit loans, swing line loans and letter of credit obligations (subject to certain exceptions specified in the Credit Agreement) exceeds 30 of our revolving credit commitments. In addition to the foregoing, under the terms of the Fourth Joinder Agreement, so long as any principal or accrued interest remains outstanding with respect to the Fourth Incremental Term Loan, we are required to comply with financial covenants consisting of the foregoing secured net leverage ratio as of the last day of each fiscal quarter and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.00 to 1.00, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. We do not believe non-compliance is reasonably likely in the foreseeable future. 
 Our Credit Agreement provides for incremental revolving and term loan facilities, and also permits other secured or unsecured debt, if, among other conditions, certain financial ratios are met, as defined and specified in the Credit Agreement. 
 
 COMMODITY TRENDS AND SEASONALITY 
 Our Company is exposed to regular price fluctuations primarily from purchases of raw materials, including ingredients and packaging materials, energy and other inputs. Primary exposures include wheat, oats, rice, corn, other grain products, eggs, sows, pasta, potatoes, bakery products, cheese, milk, butter, vegetable oils, dairy- and vegetable-based proteins, sugar and other sweeteners, fruit, nuts, natural gas, electricity, diesel fuel, carbon dioxide, folding cartons, corrugated boxes, flexible and rigid plastic film, trays and containers, beverage packaging, plastic lined cartonboard, large format bags and steel cans and lids. These costs have been volatile in recent years and future changes in such costs may cause our results of operations and our operating margins to fluctuate significantly. We manage the impact of cost increases, wherever possible, on commercially reasonable terms, by locking in prices on the quantities required to meet our anticipated production requirements. In addition, we may offset the effect of increased costs by raising prices to our customers. However, for competitive reasons, we may not be able to pass along the full effect of increases in raw materials and other input costs as we incur them. 
 Inflationary pressures can have an adverse effect on us through higher raw material, including ingredients and packaging, and energy costs, and we experienced input cost inflationary headwinds across all segments of our business during the year ended September 30, 2023. Raw material, including ingredient and packaging, and energy inflation has been widespread, rapid and significant and has put downward pressures on our profit margins. We have largely mitigated these impacts through pricing actions across all segments, cost savings measures and hedging programs. We expect inflationary pressures to continue into fiscal 2024, albeit at a slower rate than fiscal 2023 for our domestic segments. These trends could have a materially adverse impact on our businesses in the future if inflation rates significantly exceed our ability to continue to achieve price increases or cost savings or if such price increases significantly impact demand for our products. 
 Demand for certain of our products may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or other events, which may impact customer and consumer spending patterns and the timing of promotional activities. For example, demand for our egg products, potatoes, sausage, side dishes, butter and cheese tends to increase during the Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter and other holiday seasons, which may result in increased net sales during the corresponding quarters of our fiscal year when such holidays occur. However, on a consolidated basis our net sales and results of operations generally are distributed relatively evenly over the quarters of our fiscal year. 
 CURRENCY 
 Certain sales and costs of our foreign operations were denominated in currencies other than our reporting currency, primarily Pounds Sterling and Canadian Dollars. Consequently, profits from these businesses can be impacted by fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar. We incur gains and losses within our shareholders equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars. Our results of operations may be impacted by the translation of the results of operations of our foreign operations into U.S. Dollars. The exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. Dollars positively affected consolidated net sales by less than 1 during the year ended September 30, 2023, and did not have a material impact on our operating profit or net earnings during the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires the use of judgment, estimates and assumptions. We make these subjective determinations after considering our historical performance, management s experience, current economic trends and events and information from outside sources. Inherent in this process is the possibility that actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions for any particular period.

 Our critical accounting estimates are those that involve a significant amount of estimation uncertainty and have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our significant accounting policies as described in Note 2 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 Revenue Recognition, Allowance for Trade Promotions The recognition of certain variable trade promotions requires significant management judgment regarding estimated purchase volumes and program participation. Estimates are based on contractual provisions, redemption rate assumptions and our assessment of current market provisions. Redemption rate assumptions are based on historical results of similar promotions on a program-by-program basis, adjusted for current expectations of promotion performance based on current market trends. We review and update estimates of variable consideration quarterly. Uncertainties related to the estimates of variable consideration are resolved in a short time frame and do not require any additional constraint on variable consideration. Approximately 1 of our annual net sales represent variable consideration that will be resolved in the subsequent period. Based on historical experience, we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration when any uncertainties are resolved with customers. However, significant changes in our estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 Business Combinations We use the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses that meet the criteria to be accounted for as a business combination, whereby the fair value of total consideration transferred is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The allocation of the purchase price in a business combination requires us to perform valuations with significant judgment and estimates. As such, in the case of significant acquisitions, we engage the assistance of third-party valuation specialists in estimating the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
 Various valuation methodologies may be used in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the nature of the underlying asset or liability. Inventory acquired is valued using a combination of the replacement cost and comparatives sales methodologies, while property acquired is valued using a combination of the market and replacement cost new approaches. Intangible assets acquired, including customer relationships and trademarks and licensing agreements, are valued using an income-based approach. The income approach utilizes inputs that require significant assumptions for each identifiable intangible asset, including estimates regarding future revenue growth, profitability, discount rates, attrition rates, royalty rates and economic lives. Revenue growth assumptions (along with profitability assumptions) are based on historical trends and management s expectations for future growth. Discount rates are based on a weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of similar companies. Attrition rates are estimated based on historical customer experience and analysis of comparable peer transactions. Royalty rates are determined based on profit levels, research of external royalty rates by third-party specialists and the relative importance of each trademark to our Company. 
 The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. While we believe those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Additionally, determining the useful lives of tangible and intangible assets requires judgment, as different types of assets will have different useful lives. 
 Indefinite-Lived Assets We assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for recoverability utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative test. If a quantitative test is performed, the fair value is determined using an income-based approach, which requires significant assumptions for each indefinite-lived asset, including estimates regarding future revenue growth, discount rates and royalty rates. Revenue growth assumptions are based on historical trends and management s expectations for future growth. The discount rates are based on a risk adjusted weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of similar companies. Royalty rates are determined based on profit levels, research of external royalty rates by third-party specialists and the relative importance of each brand to our Company. 
 Changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets could result in impairment charges in future periods. These key assumptions are inherently uncertain and require a high degree of estimation and are subject to change based on, among others, industry and geopolitical conditions, our ability to navigate changing macroeconomic conditions and trends and the timing and success of strategic initiatives. Additionally, certain factors have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, which also could result in impairment charges. These factors include (i) failure to achieve forecasted revenue growth rates, (ii) increases in the discount rate or (iii) a significant change in profitability and the corresponding royalty rate. 
 In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we performed a quantitative impairment test for all indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded each year there were no impairments. The estimated fair value of all indefinite-lived trademarks exceeded book value by 11 or greater, 23 or greater and 22 or greater at September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Goodwill We assess goodwill for recoverability using either a qualitative or quantitative test. If a quantitative test is performed, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a combined income and market approach with a greater 
 52 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 weighting on the income approach (75 of the calculation for all reporting units). The income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue growth, profitability, capital requirements and discount rates. The market approach (25 of the calculation for all reporting units) is based on a market multiple (revenue and EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and requires an estimate of appropriate multiples based on market data. Revenue growth assumptions (along with profitability and cash flow assumptions) were based on historical trends for the reporting units and management s expectations for future growth. The discount rates were based on a risk adjusted weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of businesses similar to the reporting units and based upon management s judgment. For the market approach, we used estimated EBITDA and revenue multiples based on industry market data. 
 Changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit could result in impairment charges in future periods. These key assumptions are inherently uncertain and require a high degree of estimation and are subject to change based on, among others, industry and geopolitical conditions, our ability to navigate changing macroeconomic conditions and trends and the timing and success of strategic initiatives. Variances between the actual performance of the businesses and the assumptions that were used in developing the estimates of fair value could result in impairment charges in future periods. Factors that could create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting units include but are not limited to (i) fluctuations in forecasted sales volumes, which can be driven by external factors affecting demand such as changes in consumer preferences and consumer responses to marketing and pricing strategy, (ii) changes in product costs, including commodities, (iii) a significant change in profitability, (iv) interest rate fluctuations and (v) currency fluctuations. 
 In fiscal 2023, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 42.2 million related to our Cheese and Dairy reporting unit driven primarily by narrowing of the pricing gap between branded and private label competitors, resulting in distribution losses and declining profitability. The Cheese and Dairy reporting unit had an aggregate carrying value after impairment of 335.3 million as of September 30, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2023, our Weetabix reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 6.4 and was impacted by raw material and energy cost inflation as well as U.K. economic pressures negatively impacting consumer spending trends, both of which impacted near-term profitability. We expect these impacts to be transitory in nature; however, inherent risk to the reporting unit s cash flows remains. If we had increased the discount rate assumption used to estimate the fair value of our Weetabix reporting unit as of the fiscal 2023 annual impairment test by 50 basis points, this isolated change, which is reasonably possible to occur, would have decreased the Weetabix reporting unit s fair value below its carrying value by 1.1 . The Weetabix reporting unit had a goodwill balance of 854.3 million as of September 30, 2023. 
 For additional information on the results of our annual goodwill impairment assessment for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, refer to Note 8 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the estimated market-related value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, discount rates, future salary increases and other assumptions inherent in these valuations. We annually review the assumptions underlying the actuarial calculations and make changes to these assumptions, based on current market conditions and historical trends, as necessary. Differences between the actual returns on plan assets and the expected returns on plan assets and changes to projected future rates of return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense or income ultimately recognized. The other postretirement benefits liability (partially subsidized retiree health and life insurance) is also determined on an actuarial basis and is affected by assumptions including discount rates and expected trends in healthcare costs. Changes in the discount rates and differences between actual and expected healthcare costs will affect the recorded amount of other postretirement benefits expense. 
 For both pensions and other postretirement benefit calculations, the assumed discount rates are determined by projecting the plans expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligation or accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, discounting those expected payments using a theoretical zero-coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high-quality (rated AA or better by Moody s Investor Service) corporate bonds as of the measurement date and solving for the single equivalent discount rate that results in the same present value. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rates (from 6.06 to 5.06 for U.S. pension; from 6.01 to 5.01 for U.S. other postretirement benefits; from 5.68 to 4.68 for Canadian pension; from 5.67 to 4.67 for Canadian other postretirement benefits and from 5.67 to 4.67 for other international pension) would have increased the recorded benefit obligations at September 30, 2023 by approximately 71 million for pensions and approximately 5 million for other postretirement benefits. 
 The expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical and expected future returns of the various asset classes, using the target allocations of the plans. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed return on plan assets (from 6.50 to 5.50 for U.S.; from 5.75 to 4.75 for Canada and from 5.63 to 4.63 for other international) would have increased the net periodic benefit cost for the pension plans by approximately 7 million. We expect to contribute 0.3 million to the combined pension plans in fiscal 2024. Contributions beyond fiscal 2024 remain uncertain and will significantly depend

 on changes in actuarial assumptions, actual return on plan assets and any legislative or regulatory changes that may affect plan funding requirements. We do not make contributions to our postretirement medical benefit plans. See Note 18 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information about pension and other postretirement benefit assumptions. 
 RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 We considered all new accounting pronouncements and have concluded there are no new pronouncements that had or will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, comprehensive income, financial condition, cash flows, shareholders equity or related disclosures based on current information. 
 
 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The Company is exposed to market risk from commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, among others. For additional discussion of these risks, refer to Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements on page 1 of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to commodity price risks relating to the acquisition of raw materials, including ingredients and packaging, energy and fuel. The Company may use futures contracts and options to manage certain of these exposures when it is practical to do so. A hypothetical 10 adverse change in the market price of the Company s principal hedged commodities, including natural gas, heating oil, soybean oil, corn, wheat and dairy, would have decreased the fair value of the Company s commodity-related derivatives portfolio by approxim ately 5 million and 7 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This volatility analysis ignores changes in the exposures inherent in the underlying hedged transactions. Because the Company does not hold or trade derivatives for speculation or profit, all changes in derivative values are effectively offset by corresponding changes in the underlying commodity exposures. 
 For more information regarding the Company s commodity derivative contracts, refer to Note 13 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Related to its foreign subsidiaries, the Company is exposed to risks of fluctuations in future cash flows and earnings due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To mitigate these risks, the Company uses a combination of foreign currency exchange contracts, which may consist of options, forward contracts and currency swaps. As of both September 30, 2023 and 2022, a hypothetical 10 change in the Euro-GBP foreign currency exchange rate would have changed the fair value of the Company s foreign currency-related derivatives portfolio by an immaterial amount. 
 For additional information regarding the Company s foreign currency derivative contracts, refer to Note 13 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Long-term debt 
 As of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding principal value of indebtedness of 6,049.6 million related to its senior notes, the Fourth Incremental Term Loan and a municipal bond, and the Revolving Credit Facility had available borrowing capacity of 730.3 million. Of the total 6,049.6 million of outstanding indebtedness, 5,644.3 million bore interest at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 4.8 . As of September 30, 2022, the Company had principal value of indebtedness of 5,969.3 million related to its senior notes and a municipal bond, and the Revolving Credit Facility had available borrowing capacity of 730.3 million. Of the total 5,969.3 million of outstanding indebtedness, 5,962.9 million bore interest at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 4.8 . 
 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of the Company s total debt, excluding any outstanding indebtedness under the municipal bond, was 5,491.5 million and 5,171.0 million, respectively. Changes in interest rates impact fixed and variable rate debt differently. For fixed rate debt, a change in interest rates will only impact the fair value of the debt, whereas a change in the interest rates on variable rate debt will impact interest expense and cash flows. A hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the fixed rate debt by approximately 112 million and 111 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. A hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates would have had an immaterial impact on both interest expense and interest paid on variable rate debt during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. 
 For additional information regarding the Company s debt, refer to Note 16 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

 Interest rate swaps 
 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had interest rate swaps with a notional value of 700.0 million and 1,381.9 million, respectively. A hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the interest rate swaps by approximately 15 million and 48 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 For additional information regarding the Company s interest rate swap contracts, refer to Note 13 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Post Holdings, Inc. 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Post Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 As described in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded certain elements of the internal control over financial reporting of the acquired pet food business Pet Food from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination in the period ended September 30, 2023. Subsequent to the acquisition, certain elements of Pet Food s internal control over financial reporting and related processes were integrated into the Company s existing systems and internal control over financial reporting. Those controls that were not integrated have been excluded from management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. We have also excluded these elements of the internal control over financial reporting of Pet Food from our audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. The excluded elements represent controls over approximately 2 or 223.5 million of consolidated assets and 10 or 679.8 million of the consolidated net sales. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
 57 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Acquisition of Pet Food - Valuation of Customer Relationships and Trademarks and Licensing Agreements 
 As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, on April 28, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of a portion of The J. M. Smucker Company s pet food business Pet Food for net consideration of 1,207.5 million. Of the acquired intangible assets, 235.0 million of trademarks and licensing agreements and 391.0 million of customer relationships were recorded. As disclosed by management, the intangible assets acquired, including customer relationships and trademarks and licensing agreements, are valued using an income-based approach. The income approach utilizes inputs that require significant assumptions for each identifiable intangible asset, including estimates regarding future revenue growth, profitability, discount rates, attrition rate, royalty rates, and economic lives. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of customer relationships and trademarks and licensing agreements is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the customer relationships and trademarks and licensing agreements acquired, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to future revenue growth, profitability, discount rate, attrition rate, and economic life for customer relationships and future revenue growth, profitability, discount rates, royalty rates, and economic lives for trademarks and licensing agreements, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management s valuation of the customer relationships and trademarks and licensing agreements. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimate of the customer relationships and trademarks and licensing agreements acquired, (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income approaches used to estimate fair value, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the income approaches, and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to future revenue growth, profitability, discount rate, attrition rate and economic life for customer relationships and future revenue growth, profitability, discount rates, royalty rates, and economic lives for tradenames and licensing agreements. Evaluating management s significant assumptions related to future revenue growth and profitability for customer relationships and trademarks and licensing agreements involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Pet Food business, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company s income approaches, and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate, attrition rate, and economic life for customer relationships and the discount rates, royalty rates, and economic lives for trademarks and licensing agreements. 
 Goodwill Impairment Assessment Weetabix Reporting Unit Within the Weetabix Segment and Cheese and Dairy Reporting Unit Within the Refrigerated Retail Segment 
 As described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, as of September 30, 2023, the Company s goodwill balance was 4,574.4 million, of which the goodwill associated with the Refrigerated Retail and Weetabix segments was 712.8 million and 854.3 million, respectively. The Cheese and Dairy reporting unit within the Refrigerated Retail segment and the Weetabix reporting unit within the Weetabix segment each make up a certain portion and a significant portion of the 
 58 

Table of Cont e n t s 

 respective segments. Management conducts a goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year following the annual forecasting process, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Management recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 42.2 million related to the Cheese and Dairy reporting unit driven primarily by narrowing of the pricing gap between branded and private label competitors, resulting in distribution losses and declining profitability. Additionally, as of September 30, 2023, the Weetabix reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 6.4 and was impacted by raw material and energy cost inflation as well as U.K. economic pressures negatively impacting consumer spending trends, both of which impacted near-term profitability. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a combined income and market approach with a greater weighting on the income approach. The income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue, profitability, capital requirements and discount rates. The market approach is based on a market multiple (revenue and EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples based on market data for comparable peers. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Weetabix reporting unit within the Weetabix segment and the Cheese and Dairy reporting unit within the Refrigerated Retail segment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the Weetabix and Cheese and Dairy reporting units, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to future revenue, profitability, the discount rates, the revenue market multiples and the EBITDA market multiples, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Weetabix and the Cheese and Dairy reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimates, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income and market approaches used to estimate fair value, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approaches, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to future revenue, profitability, the discount rates, the revenue market multiples and the EBITDA market multiples. Evaluating management s significant assumptions related to future revenue and profitability involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Weetabix and Cheese and Dairy reporting units, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company s income and market approaches, and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rates, the revenue market multiples and the EBITDA market multiples assumptions.

 million units of PHPC (the PHPC Units, and such transaction, the PHPC IPO ), of which a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company PHPC Sponsor purchased million PHPC Units. Each PHPC Unit consisted of share of Series A common stock of PHPC PHPC Series A Common Stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock at an exercise price of per share (the PHPC Warrants ). The PHPC Units were sold at a price of per PHPC Unit, generating gross proceeds to PHPC of . The PHPC Units, PHPC Series A Common Stock and PHPC Warrants each traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE under the ticker symbols PSPC.U , PSPC and PSPC WS , respectively. Under the terms of the PHPC IPO, PHPC was required to consummate a partnering transaction by May 28, 2023, which could have been extended to August 28, 2023 in certain circumstances (the Combination Period ). 
 Substantially concurrently with the closing of the PHPC IPO, PHPC completed the private sale of million units of PHPC (the PHPC Private Placement Units ), at a purchase price of per PHPC Private Placement Unit, to PHPC Sponsor, generating proceeds to PHPC of (the PHPC Private Placement ).

million shares of Series F common stock of PHPC (the PHPC Series F Common Stock ), had certain governance rights in PHPC relating to the election of PHPC directors and voting rights on amendments to PHPC s amended and restated certificate of incorporation.

 In determining the accounting treatment of the Company s equity interest in PHPC, management concluded that PHPC was a variable interest entity VIE as defined by ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. A VIE is an entity in which equity investors at risk lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. VIEs are consolidated by the primary beneficiary, the party who has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance, as well as the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. PHPC Sponsor was the primary beneficiary of PHPC as it had, through its equity interest, the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses from PHPC, as well as the power to direct a majority of the activities that significantly impacted PHPC s economic performance, including partnering transaction target identification. As such, PHPC was fully consolidated into the Company s financial statements until the time of its dissolution, as discussed below. 
 Pr oceeds of were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of PHPC s public stockholders, which consisted of certain proceeds from the PHPC IPO and certain proceeds from the PHPC Private Placement, net of underwriters discounts and commissions and other costs and expenses. A minimum balance of , which represented the number of PHPC Units sold at the offering price of per PHPC Unit , was required by the underwriting agreement to be maintained in the trust account. These pr oceeds were invested only in U.S. treasury securities. At September 30, 2022, there was held in the trust account, which was included in Investments held in trust on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The public stockholders ownership of PHPC equity represented a NCI to the Company, which was classified outside of permanent shareholders equity as the PHPC Series A Common Stock was redeemable at the option of the public stockholders in certain circumstances. The carrying amount of the redeemable NCI was equal to the greater of (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the redeemable NCI s share of PHPC s net earnings or loss, OCI and distributions or (ii) the redemption value. The redemption value represented the amount the public stockholders of PHPC Series A Common Stock would be entitled in certain circumstances to redeem their shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock for, which was a pro-rata portion of the amount in the trust account at per share of PHPC Series A Common Stock held, plus any pro-rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (which interest was net of taxes payable, and less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses). As of September 30, 2022, the carrying amount of the redeemable NCI was recorded at its redemption value of on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Remeasurements to the redemption value of the redeemable NCI were recognized as a deemed dividend and were recorded to Retained earnings on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 In connection with the PHPC IPO, PHPC incurred offering costs of , of which was recorded to the redeemable NCI and was reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2021. Of the offering costs incurred, were deferred underwriting commissions that would have become payable to the underwriters solely in the event that PHPC completed a partnering transaction and were included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2022. 
 As of September 30, 2022 and prior to the PHPC Redemption (as defined below), the Company beneficially owned of the equity of PHPC and the net earnings and net assets of PHPC were consolidated within the Company s financial statements. The remaining of the consolidated net earnings and net assets of PHPC, which represented the percentage of economic interest in PHPC held by the public stockholders of PHPC through their ownership of PHPC equity, were allocated to redeemable NCI. All transactions between PHPC and PHPC Sponsor, as well as related financial statement impacts, eliminated in consolidation. 
 On May 11, 2023, PHPC announced that it would not complete a partnering transaction within the Combination Period and that the entity would liquidate and dissolve in accordance with the terms of its amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Subsequent to the decision to liquidate and dissolve, PHPC completed certain winding-up activities, which included writing-off the deferred underwriting commissions as the underwriters agreed to waive their rights to these amounts should a partnering transaction not occur. The Company recorded a gain in connection with this write-off, which was recorded in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended September 30, 2023.

 redeemable NCI of immediately prior to the PHPC Redemption was reduced to zero on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023. 
 Subsequent to the PHPC Redemption, PHPC delisted from the NYSE and dissolved in June 2023, and all classes of shares of PHPC equity were cancelled, including the PHPC Private Placement Units and the shares of the PHPC Series F Common Stock, which were surrendered by PHPC Sponsor for no consideration. PHPC Sponsor subsequently dissolved in August 2023.

Based on the terms of 8th Avenue s governing documents, management determined that the Company does not have a controlling voting interest in 8th Avenue due to substantive participating rights held by third parties associated

 During the year ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of related to its Cheese and Dairy reporting unit within the Refrigerated Retail segment, which was recorded in Impairment of goodwill in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The goodwill impairment charge was driven primarily by narrowing of the pricing gap between branded and private label competitors, resulting in distribution losses and declining profitability. See Note 14 for additional information on the significant assumptions utilized in the estimate of the fair value of the Cheese and Dairy reporting unit. The Company did not record a goodwill impairment charge during the years ended September 30, 2022 or 2021, as all reporting units subjected to the quantitative test passed during each respective year. 
 At September 30, 2023 , the Weetabix reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately and was impacted by raw material and energy cost inflation as well as U.K. economic pressures negatively impacting consumer spending trends, both of which impacted near-term profitability. The Company expects these impacts to be transitory in nature; however, inherent risk to the reporting unit s cash flows remains. Variances between the actual performance of the reporting unit and the assumptions that were used in developing the estimate of fair value could result in impairment charges in future periods. The estimated fair values of all other reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least at September 30, 2023 . 
 At September 30, 2022, the Cheese and Dairy reporting unit and the Refrigerated Retail reporting unit fair values exceeded their carrying values by approximately and , respectively, and the estimated fair values of all other reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least .

The expiration for the majority of these carryforwards are either greater than years or are able to be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has offset approximately of the state NOLs and all of the of foreign tax loss carryforwards by a valuation allowance based on management s judgment that it is more likely than not that the benefits of those deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. In addition, as of September 30, 2023, the Company had a deferred tax asset for disallowed U.S. interest expense of subject to Internal Revenue Code Section 163(j) limitations, which may be carried forward indefinitely. Based on management s judgement, with the exception of a valuation allowance recorded for state-related disallowed interest carryforwards, it is more likely than not that the Company will recognize the benefit of this deferred tax asset in the future. 
 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a valuation allowance of and , respectively, based on management s judgment that it is more likely than not that the benefits of its deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future.

These changes primarily relate to valuation allowances on state carryforwards. 
 The Company generally repatriates a portion of current year earnings from select non-U.S. subsidiaries only if the economic cost of the repatriation is not considered material. No provision has been made for income taxes on the Company s undistributed earnings of consolidated foreign subsidiaries of as of September 30, 2023, as it is the Company s intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to, amongst other things, fund local operations, fund debt service payments, fund pension and other post-retirement obligations, fund capital projects and support foreign growth initiatives, including potential acquisitions. If the Company repatriated any of the earnings, it could be subject to withholding tax and the impact of foreign currency movements. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes and applicable foreign withholding taxes that would be payable on the remittance of such undistributed earnings. Applicable income and withholding taxes will be provided on these earnings in the periods in which they are no longer considered reinvested. 
 U.K. Tax Law Changes 
 In fiscal 2021, the effective income tax rate was impacted by enacted tax law changes in the U.K., which included a provision to increase the U.K. s corporate income tax rate from to , effective April 1, 2023. During the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company measured its existing deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the

 , and , respectively. Other changes made to the U.K. s tax laws did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 or 2021. 
 Unrecognized Tax Benefits 
 The Company recognizes the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. To the extent the Company s assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate will be recorded in the period in which the determination is made. 
 Unrecognized tax benefits activity is presented in the following table. 
 Additions for tax positions taken in current year and acquisitions Additions for tax positions taken in prior years Settlements with tax authorities/statute expirations ) ) ) Balance, end of year 
 The amount of the net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would directly affect the effective income tax rate was at September 30, 2023. The Company believes that, due to expiring statutes of limitations and settlements with tax authorities, it is reasonably possible that the total unrecognized tax benefits may decrease up to approximately within twelve months of the reporting date. 
 The Company computes tax-related interest and penalties as the difference between the tax position recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amount previously taken on the Company s tax returns and classifies these amounts as components of income tax expense (benefit). The Company recorded income tax expense (benefit) of , and ) related to interest and penalties in the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company had accrued interest and penalties of and at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The accrued interest and penalties are not included in the table above.

 Derivative assets Equity securities Investment in BellRing Liabilities: Deferred compensation liabilities Derivative liabilities 
 Deferred Compensation 
 The deferred compensation investments are primarily invested in mutual funds, and their fair value is measured using the market approach. These investments are in the same funds, or funds that employ a similar investment strategy, and are purchased in substantially the same amounts, as the participants selected notional investment options (excluding Post common stock equivalents), which represent the underlying liabilities to participants in the Company s deferred compensation plans. Deferred compensation liabilities are recorded at amounts due to participants in cash, based on the fair value of participants selected notional investment options (excluding certain Post common stock equivalents to be distributed in shares) using the market approach. 
 Derivatives 
 The Company utilizes the income approach to measure fair value for its commodity and energy derivatives. The income approach uses pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves and forward prices. FX contracts are valued using the spot rate less the forward rate multiplied by the notional amount. The Company s calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve. Refer to Note 13 for the classification of changes in fair value of derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 As of September 30, 2022, the PHPC Warrants were valued using the market approach based on quoted prices and were categorized as Level 1. The fair value of the PHPC Warrants was zero as of September 30, 2023, as the PHPC Warrants expired worthless in connection with the PHPC Redemption. For additional information on the PHPC Warrants, see Notes 5 and 13. 
 Equity Securities and Investment in BellRing 
 The Company uses the market approach to measure the fair value of its equity securities. The Investment in BellRing represented the Company s equity interest in BellRing as of September 30, 2022, which was measured at its fair value of based on the trading value of the BellRing Common Stock on September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, the Company did not hold an equity interest in BellRing. For additional information on the Investment in BellRing, see Notes 4 and 5. 
 Other Fair Value Measurements 
 Investments held in trust held prior to the PHPC Redemption were invested in a fund consisting entirely of U.S. treasury securities. The fund was valued at net asset value NAV per share, and as such, in accordance with ASC Topic 820, the investments were not classified in the fair value hierarchy. Investments held in trust were reported at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022. In connection with the PHPC Redemption, the investments held in trust were liquidated and the proceeds were disbursed to PHPC s public stockholders, including to the Company, during fiscal 2023. For additional information, see Note 5. 
 The Company s financial assets and liabilities also include cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable for which the carrying value approximates fair value due to their short maturities (less than 12 months). The Company does not record its current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value

 Certain assets and liabilities, including property, goodwill, other intangible assets and assets held for sale, are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis using Level 3 inputs. During the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of related to its Cheese and Dairy reporting unit within the Refrigerated Retail segment, which was recorded in Impairment of goodwill in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were no goodwill impairment charges recorded during the years ended September 30, 2022 or 2021. For additional information on goodwill, see Notes 2 and 8. 
 During fiscal 2022, the Company sold the Klingerstown Equipment and entered into an agreement to sell the Jefferson City Equipment, which subsequently closed in fiscal 2023. The Klingerstown Equipment and the Jefferson City Equipment were reported in the Foodservice segment. For additional information on assets held for sale, see Note 7. 
 The fair value of assets held for sale was measured on a non-recurring basis based on the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. When applicable, the fair value is adjusted to reflect an offer to purchase the assets. The fair value measurements were categorized as Level 3, as the fair values utilize significant unobservable inputs. The following table summarizes the Level 3 activity.

All cases were transferred to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated and/or consolidated pretrial proceedings. 
 The cases involved plaintiff groups: (i) a nationwide class of direct purchasers of shell eggs (the direct purchaser class (ii) individual companies (primarily large grocery chains and food companies that purchase considerable quantities of eggs) that opted out of various settlements and filed their own complaints related to their purchases of shell eggs and egg products (the opt-out plaintiffs and (iii) indirect purchasers of shell eggs (the indirect purchaser plaintiffs ). 
 Resolution of this matter : (i) In December 2016, MFI settled all claims asserted against it by the direct purchaser class for a payment of , which was approved by the district court in December 2017; (ii) in January 2017, MFI settled all claims asserted against it by opt-out plaintiffs related to shell egg purchases on confidential terms; (iii) in June 2018, MFI settled all claims asserted against it by indirect purchaser plaintiffs on confidential terms; (iv) between June 2019 and September 2019, MFI individually settled on confidential terms egg product opt-out claims asserted against it by four separate opt-out plaintiffs; and (v) in September 2022, MFI settled the remaining pending claims for this matter, which had sought damages based on purchases of egg products by three opt-out plaintiffs, on confidential terms.

In the opinion of management, based upon the information presently known, the ultimate liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, as well as from asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities (if any), are not expected to be material individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. In addition, although it is difficult to estimate the potential financial impact of actions regarding expenditures for compliance with regulatory matters, in the opinion of management, based upon the information currently available, the ultimate liability arising from such compliance matters is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

 Deferred Compensation 
 Post provides deferred compensation plans for directors and key employees through which eligible participants may elect to defer payment of all or a portion of their compensation, and, with respect to key employee participants, all or a portion of their eligible annual bonus, until a later date based on the participant s elections. Participant deferrals for employee and director participants may be notionally invested in Post common stock equivalents (the Equity Option or into a number of funds operated by The Vanguard Group Inc. with a variety of investment strategies and objectives (the Vanguard Funds ). In order to receive a matching contribution, deferrals for director participants must be made into the Equity Option. Deferrals into the Equity Option are generally distributed in Post common stock for employees and cash for directors, while deferrals into the Vanguard Funds are distributed in cash. There are no significant costs related to the administration of the deferred compensation plans. Post funds its deferred compensation liability (potential cash distributions) by investing in the Vanguard Funds in substantially the same amounts as selected by the participating employees. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses on these investments are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and offset the related change in the deferred compensation liability. For additional information regarding deferred compensation, see Note 14.

 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES

Document 

Exhibit 4.7 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF POST HOLDINGS, INC. S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO 
 SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 
 The following is a brief description of the registered securities of Post Holdings, Inc. (the Company, Post, we, us or our ). This description is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of our amended and restated articles of incorporation (as amended, the articles of incorporation filed as Exhibit 3.1 to our Form 10-Q filed on February 2, 2018 and incorporated herein by reference, as amended by the amendment of the articles of incorporation filed as Exhibit 3.2 to our Form 10-Q filed on February 2, 2018 and incorporated herein by reference, and to the full text of our amended and restated bylaws (the bylaws filed as Exhibit 3.1 to our Form 8-K filed on January 17, 2023 and incorporated herein by reference. 
 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK 
 General 
 The articles of incorporation provide that we may issue up to 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value of 0.01 per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value of 0.01 per share. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE under the symbol POST . 
 Common Stock 
 Voting Rights. The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on the applicable record date on all matters voted on by shareholders, including elections of directors, and, except as otherwise required by law or provided in any resolution adopted by our Board of Directors with respect to any shares of our preferred stock, the holders of such shares will exclusively possess all voting power. Our articles of incorporation do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors. 
 Dividends. Subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding series of preferred stock created by our Board of Directors from time to time, the holders of our common stock on the applicable record date will be entitled to such dividends as may be declared from time to time by our Board of Directors from funds available therefor, and upon liquidation will be entitled to receive pro rata all of our assets available for distribution to such holders. 
 Other Rights. Our articles of incorporation do not provide for any preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for any stock or other securities, and there are no conversion rights or redemption or sinking fund provisions with respect to such stock. We are able to issue additional shares of common stock without shareholder approval, subject to applicable rules of the NYSE and Missouri law, for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public or private offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans and equity grants. The existence of unissued and unreserved common stock may enable us to issue shares to persons who are friendly to current management, which could discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. We will not solicit approval of our shareholders for issuance of common stock unless our Board of Directors believes that approval is advisable or is required by applicable rules of the NYSE or Missouri law. 
 Limitations of Rights of Holders of Common Stock - Preferred Stock 
 The rights of holders of common stock may be materially limited or qualified by the rights of holders of preferred stock that we may issue in the future. Set forth below is a description of the Company s authority to issue preferred stock and the possible terms of that stock. 
 Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix, by resolution, the voting powers, which may be full or limited or no voting powers, such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof of the shares constituting any series, without any further vote or action by the shareholders. Any shares of preferred 

stock so authorized and issued could have priority over our common stock with respect to dividend and or liquidation rights. Our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to determine, for each class or series of preferred stock, the following information 
 the number of shares constituting such series of preferred stock and the designations thereof 
 the rate and times at which, and the conditions, if any, under which, dividends will be payable on shares of that series, the status of those dividends as cumulative or non-cumulative and the priority of payments 
 the voting rights pertaining to shares of the series 
 whether or not the shares of the series are convertible into or exchangeable for other securities, including common stock, and the price and other terms and conditions of conversion or exchange 
 the price or prices and times at which, and the terms and conditions upon which, the shares of the series may be redeemed, if any 
 the terms of a sinking fund, if any, to be provided for such shares 
 the rights which the holders of shares of the series have in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up 
 whether to include, from time to time, any additional shares of preferred stock in the series and 
 any other relative powers, preferences and rights, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. 
 The issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock as such holders will be subject to the rights of holders of any preferred stock issued. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing an acquisition of us at a price which many shareholders may find attractive. These provisions also could also make it more difficult for our shareholders to effect certain corporate actions, including the election of directors. 
 Certain Provisions of Missouri Law and Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 Amendment of Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws . The General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri (the GBCL provides that a corporation may amend its articles of incorporation upon a resolution of the board of directors, proposing the amendment and its submission to the shareholders for their approval upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the holders of shares of outstanding common stock entitled to vote thereon. Our articles of incorporation provide that the articles of incorporation may be amended in accordance with and upon the vote prescribed by the laws of the State of Missouri, except that 
 two-thirds of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, is required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, the provisions of Article Five of the articles of incorporation, which relates to directors, and 
 85 of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors voting together as a single class is required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, the provisions relating to indemnification of directors, officers and certain other persons, or, unless approved by a majority of the Board of Directors or continuing directors (if applicable) as described in the articles of incorporation, any provision relating to Article Nine of the articles of incorporation, which relates to certain business combinations. 

Anti-Takeover Provisions in Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. Some of the provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and Missouri law could have the following effects, among others 
 delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us 
 delaying, deferring or preventing the removal of our existing management or directors 
 deterring potential acquirors from making an offer to our shareholders and 
 limiting our shareholders opportunity to realize premiums over prevailing market prices of our common stock in connection with offers by potential acquirors. 
 The following is a summary of some of the provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws that could have the effects described above. 
 Supermajority Voting Requirements for Certain Business Combinations. Our articles of incorporation contain a restriction on transactions defined as business combinations (as defined below). No business combination with an interested shareholder (as defined below) or affiliates of an interested shareholder may be consummated without first being recommended by our Board of Directors and approved by the affirmative vote of 85 of our then outstanding voting stock of which the interested shareholder is not the beneficial owner. This approval requirement is in addition to any other requirement of law, our articles of incorporation and our bylaws. This approval requirement does not apply to a business combination that 
 has been approved by a majority of our continuing directors, which generally include our directors who were members of our Board of Directors prior to the time that any interested shareholder became an interested shareholder and any successors of such members who are designated as continuing directors by a majority of our then continuing directors or 
 the consideration paid in the business combination is in cash or in the same form as the interested shareholder previously paid for a majority of the shares owned by the interested shareholder, and the value of consideration received is not less than the higher of (i) the highest per share price paid by the interested shareholder for any shares in the two years immediately preceding the announcement of the business combination or (ii) the market value of the shares on the date the business combination is approved by our Board of Directors. 
 Business combination generally includes a merger or consolidation, sale or other disposition of a substantial amount of our assets, a plan of liquidation or dissolution of Post, or other transactions involving the transfer, issuance, reclassification or recapitalization of Post securities, in each case with an interested shareholder or an affiliate of an interested shareholder. Interested shareholder generally includes a person who is the beneficial owner of 20 or more of our then outstanding voting stock. 
 Classified Board of Directors. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws provide that our Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms. Each class, to the extent possible, will be equal in number. Each class holds office until the third annual shareholders meeting for election of directors following the most recent election of such class. 
 Directors, and Not Shareholders, Fix the Size of the Board of Directors. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws provide that the number of directors will be fixed from time to time exclusively pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of our Board of Directors, but in no event will it consist of less than five nor more than twelve directors. 
 Directors are Removed for Cause Only. Missouri law provides that, unless a corporation s articles of incorporation provide otherwise, the holders of a majority of the corporation s voting stock may remove any director from office. Our articles of incorporation provide that shareholders may remove a director only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of (i) two-thirds of all members of our Board of Directors and (ii) the holders of at least two-thirds of our voting stock. 

Board Vacancies to Be Filled by Remaining Directors and Not Shareholders. Any vacancy in the Board of Directors created by any reason prior to the expiration of the term in which the vacancy occurs will be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum. A director elected to fill a vacancy will be elected for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor. 
 Shareholders May Only Act by Written Consent Upon Unanimous Written Consent. Under our bylaws and Missouri law, shareholder action by written consent must be unanimous. 
 No Special Meetings Called by Shareholders. Our bylaws provide that special meetings may only be called by the Chairman of our Board of Directors, our President or a majority of the entire Board of Directors. Only such business will be conducted, and only such proposals acted upon, as are specified in the notice of the special meeting. 
 Advance Notice for Shareholder Proposals and Nominations. Our bylaws contain provisions requiring that advance notice be delivered to Post of any business to be brought by a shareholder before an annual meeting and providing for procedures to be followed by shareholders in nominating persons for election to our Board of Directors. Ordinarily, the shareholder must give notice not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the date of the first anniversary of the prior year s annual meeting however, in the event that the date of the meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such date, notice by the shareholder must be received not earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made. The notice must include a description of the proposal, the reasons for the proposal and other specified matters. Our Board of Directors may reject any proposals that have not followed these procedures or that are not a proper subject for shareholder action in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. 
 Amendment of Bylaws. Under our articles of incorporation and bylaws, our bylaws may be amended by two-thirds of all of the members of our Board of Directors or by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our capital stock entitled to vote on any such amendment. However, our Board of Directors may not amend our bylaws in a manner that alters the shareholders power to amend the bylaws, and the shareholders may not amend the bylaws in a manner that alters the Board s power to amend the bylaws. 
 Missouri Statutory Provisions . Missouri law also contains certain provisions which may have an anti-takeover effect and otherwise discourage third parties from effecting transactions with us, including business combination and control share acquisition statutes. 
 Business Combination Statute. Missouri law contains a business combination statute which is similar to the provision in our articles of incorporation and restricts certain business combinations (as defined below) between a company and an interested shareholder (as defined below) or affiliates of the interested shareholder, for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person becomes an interested shareholder, unless either such transaction or the interested shareholder s acquisition of stock is approved by the board of directors on or before the date the interested shareholder obtains such status. 
 The statute also provides that, after the expiration of such five-year period, business combinations are prohibited unless 
 the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting stock, other than the stock owned by the interested shareholder, or any affiliate or associate of such interested shareholder, approve the business combination or 
 the business combination satisfies certain detailed fairness and procedural requirements. 
 A business combination for this purpose includes a merger or consolidation, some sales, leases, exchanges, pledges and similar dispositions of corporate assets or stock and any reclassifications or recapitalizations that generally increase the proportionate voting power of the interested shareholder. An interested shareholder for this purpose generally means any person who owns or controls 20 or more of the outstanding shares of the corporation s voting stock. 

A Missouri corporation may opt out of coverage by the business combination statute by including a provision to that effect in its governing corporate documents. We have not done so. The business combination statute may make it more difficult for a 20 beneficial owner to effect other transactions with us and may encourage persons that seek to acquire us to negotiate with our Board of Directors prior to acquiring a 20 interest. It is possible that such a provision could make it more difficult to accomplish a transaction which our shareholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interest. 
 Control Share Acquisition Statute . Missouri also has a control share acquisition statute. This statute may limit the rights of a shareholder to vote some or all of its shares. Generally, a shareholder whose acquisition of shares results in that shareholder having voting power, when added to the shares previously held by it, to exercise or direct the exercise of more than a specified percentage of our outstanding stock (beginning at 20 ), such shareholder will lose the right to vote some or all of its shares in excess of such percentage unless the shareholders approve the acquisition of such shares. 
 In order for the shareholders to grant approval, the acquiring shareholder must meet disclosure requirements specified in the statute. In addition, a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote must approve the acquisition. Furthermore, a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, but excluding all interested shares, such as shares held by the acquiring shareholder or employee directors and officers, must approve the acquisition. 
 Not all acquisitions of shares constitute control share acquisitions. The following acquisitions do not constitute control share acquisitions 
 good faith gifts 
 transfers in accordance with wills or the laws of descent and distribution 
 purchases made in connection with an issuance of shares by us 
 purchases by any compensation or benefit plan 
 the conversion of debt securities 
 acquisitions pursuant to a binding contract whereby the holders of shares representing at least two-thirds of our voting power agree to sell their shares to the acquiror, provided that such holders act simultaneously and the transaction is not pursuant to or in connection with a tender offer 
 acquisitions pursuant to the satisfaction of some pledges or other security interests created in good faith 
 mergers involving us which satisfy other specified requirements of the GBCL 
 transactions with a person who owned a majority of our voting power within the prior year or 
 purchases from a person who previously satisfied the requirements of the control share acquisition statute, so long as the acquiring person does not have voting power after the ownership in an ownership range in excess of that of the selling shareholder prior to the sale. 
 A Missouri corporation may opt out of coverage by the control share acquisition statute by including a provision to that effect in its governing corporate documents. We have not done so. 
 Takeover Bid Disclosure Statute . Missouri s takeover bid disclosure statute requires that, under some circumstances, before making a tender offer that would result in the offeror acquiring control of us, the offeror must file certain disclosure materials with the Commissioner of the Missouri Department of Securities.

 EXEC COMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY

Document 

Exhibit 97.1 
 
 POST HOLDINGS, INC. 
 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY 
 In the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement (as defined below) the result of which is that any incentive based compensation (as defined below) subject to this policy was erroneously awarded, the Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee will reasonably promptly recover that erroneously awarded incentive based compensation (as defined below), unless recovery is exempt pursuant to the applicable federal securities laws and or stock exchange listing standards. 
 The incentive-based compensation subject to this policy is any such compensation received (as defined below) by an executive officer (as defined below) (all of the following conditions must be satisfied) 
 (i) after beginning service as an executive officer, 
 (ii) who served as an executive officer at any time during the performance period for that incentive-based compensation, 
 (iii) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange and 
 (iv) during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare the accounting restatement (as well as any transition period that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years (a transition period between the last day of the Company s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of 9 to 12 months would be deemed a completed fiscal year)). For clarity purposes, the date that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement is the date the Company s Board of Directors, a committee of the Company s Board of Directors or an officer or officers of the Company authorized to take that action concludes or reasonably should have concluded that the accounting restatement was required or the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an accounting restatement. 
 Erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation is the amount of incentive-based compensation received that exceeds the amount of incentive-based compensation that otherwise would have been received had that compensation been determined based on the amounts restated in the accounting restatement, computed without regard to taxes. For incentive-based compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation cannot be mathematically calculated directly from the information in the accounting restatement, the erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation will be determined based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the incentive-based compensation was received. The Company will maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate. 
 For the purposes of this policy 
 (i) An accounting restatement refers to any restatement of the Company s previously issued financial statements due to the material non-compliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. 
 (ii) An executive officer refers to the term as defined in Section 303A.14 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, or any successor provision, which would include any officer of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as determined from time to time. 
 (iii) A financial reporting measure is any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measure that is derived wholly or in part from that measure. For clarity purposes, stock price and total shareholder return are financial reporting measures, and a financial reporting measure does not need to be presented within financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

(iv) Incentive based compensation means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure. 
 (v) Incentive-based compensation is considered received in the Company s fiscal period during which the financial reporting measure specified in the incentive-based compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the incentive-based compensation occurs after the end of that period. 
 This policy supersedes the Company s prior policy, adopted May 4, 2015 (the Prior Policy ), for compensation received on or after the Effective Date. The Company s Prior Policy will continue to apply with respect to compensation received prior to the Effective Date. 
 Effective Date October 2, 2023
