ITEM
1. BUSINESS. 

Overview 

Healthcare
Integrated Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively the Company, we, our or us is a healthcare technology company based in Knoxville, Tennessee. We are creating a diversified spectrum of healthcare technology solutions
to integrate and automate the continuing care, home care and professional healthcare spaces. 

Our
initial product, SafeSpace with AI Vision , is an ambient fall detection solution designed for continuing care communities
and at home use. SafeSpace includes hardware devices utilizing RGB, radar and other sensor technology coupled with our internally developed
software to effectively monitor a person remotely. In continuing care communities, SafeSpace detects resident falls and generates alerts
to a centralized, intelligent dashboard without the use of wearable devices or any action by the resident. In the home, SafeSpace detects
falls and sends alerts directly to designated individuals. 

We
recently introduced and are currently pilot testing two additional products - SafeFace and SafeGuard . SafeFace provides
fully automated and ambient time and attendance reporting for facility staff, and an integrated and automatic agency invoice reconciliation
feature. SafeGuard is a novel fully ambient elopement detection and alerting system based on our facial recognition technology. 

In
addition to our current product offerings, we are developing a home concierge healthcare service application to provide a virtual assisted
living experience for seniors, recently released postoperative patients, and others. The concierge application will enable the consumer
to obtain home healthcare services and health and safety monitoring equipment to improve quality of life. We are also working to develop
a fully integrated solution for the professional healthcare community that integrates electronic health records, remote patient monitoring,
telehealth, and other items where integration is beneficial. 

Our
History 

The
Company has had three distinct businesses. First, we were incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 25, 2013 as Tomichi Creek Outfitters,
aiming to provide professionally guided big game hunts in Sargents, Colorado which is approximately four hours southwest from Denver.
This area of the country is home to trophy size Elk and Mule Deer. Our secondary business included offering guided scenic tours on the
western slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Every season offers a diversified plethora of wildlife and stunning scenic views. Our Chief Executive
Officer CEO and sole director at that time was Jeremy Gindro. These operations were discontinued in 2015. 

Second,
on March 2, 2015, the Company entered into a Business Acquisition Agreement and share exchange under which we acquired the business and
assets of Grasshopper Staffing, Inc. Grasshopper Colorado ), formed in the state of Colorado on January 13, 2015. The exchange
for 10,651 was represented by 250,000 shares of the Company s common stock in exchange for all the outstanding shares of Grasshopper
Colorado. The assets purchased include the trademark and website, office supplies and office furniture. On November 2, 2015 we filed
a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation changing the name of our Company from Tomichi Creek Outfitters to Grasshopper
Staffing, Inc. Grasshopper Colorado was operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and was the primary operation of our business
until the acquisition of IndeLiving Holdings Inc., on March 13, 2018. Our management consisted of Melanie Osterman as CEO, and Jeremy
Gindro who was our sole director. The operations of Grasshopper Colorado were discontinued in February 2019. 

Third,
we acquired IndeLiving Holdings, Inc. IndeLiving on March 13, 2018 and changed our name to Healthcare Integrated
Technologies, Inc. Our current operations are described in the above Overview section. With the acquisition of IndeLiving, we had another change in
management, and Scott M. Boruff became our CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors. 

4 

Employees
and Human Capital 

At
July 31, 2023, we had 4 employees. 

At
July 31, 2022, we had 4 employees. 

None
of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages
and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

Our
objectives surrounding human capital resources include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing
and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plan are to
attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value
and promote the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our
objectives. 

Available
Information 

We
electronically file certain documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). We file annual reports on Form 10-K; quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q; and current reports on Form 8-K (as appropriate); along with any related amendments and supplements thereto. From
time-to-time, we may also file registration statements and related documents in connection with equity or debt offerings. You may read
and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You may

website at www.sec.gov that contains reports and other information regarding registrants that file electronically with the SEC. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Risks
Related to Economic and Market Conditions 

General
Economic and Financial Conditions 

The
success of any investment activity is influenced by general economic and financial conditions, all of which are beyond the control of
the Company. These conditions, such as the recent global economic concerns and significant downturns in the financial markets, may materially
adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to implement our business strategy and/or meet our return objectives. 

Risks
Related to Our Business 

The
Company s industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors, which may give them
an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete 

We
are involved in a highly competitive industry where we may compete with numerous other companies who offer alternative methods or approaches,
who may have far greater resources, more experience, and personnel more qualified than we do. Such resources may give our competitors
an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or products that make our products obsolete. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to successfully compete against these other entities. 

The
Company may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change in its industry and such change may increase costs and competition
that may adversely affect its business 

Rapidly
changing technologies, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards characterize the Company s
market. The continued growth of the internet and intense competition in the Company s industry exacerbate these market characteristics.
The Company s future success will depend on its ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the
performance features and reliability of its products and services. The Company may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent
the successful development, introduction or marketing of its products and services. In addition, any new enhancements must meet the requirements
of its current and prospective users and must achieve significant market acceptance. The Company could also incur substantial costs if
it needs to modify its products and services or infrastructures to adapt to these changes. 

5 

The
Company also expects that new competitors may introduce products, systems or services that are directly or indirectly competitive with
the Company. These competitors may succeed in developing products, systems and services that have greater functionality or are less costly
than the Company s products, systems and services, and may be more successful in marketing such products, systems and services.
Technological changes have lowered the cost of operating communications and computer systems and purchasing software. These changes reduce
the Company s cost of providing services but also facilitate increased competition by reducing competitors costs in providing
similar services. This competition could increase price competition and reduce anticipated profit margins. 

The
Company s services are new and its industry is evolving 

You
should consider the Company s viability by considering the risks, uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by companies
in their early stage of development. To be successful in this industry, the Company must, among other things: 

develop
 and introduce functional and attractive services; 

attract
 and maintain a large base of customers; 

increase
 awareness of the Company brand and develop consumer loyalty; 

respond
 to competitive and technological developments; 

build
 an operations structure to support the Company business; and 

attract,
 retain and motivate qualified personnel. 

The
Company cannot guarantee that it will succeed in achieving these goals, and its failure to do so would have a material adverse effect
on its business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. 

The
Company s products and services are new and are in the early stages of development. The Company is not certain that these products
and services will function as anticipated or be desirable to its intended market. Also, some of the Company s products and services
may have limited functionalities, which may limit their appeal to consumers and put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. If the
Company s current or future products and services fail to function properly or if the Company does not achieve or sustain market
acceptance, it could lose customers or could be subject to claims which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business,
financial condition and operating results. 

Risks
Related to Our Company 

Uncertainty
of profitability 

Our
business strategy may result in increased volatility of future revenues and earnings. As we will only develop a limited number of products
and services at a time, our overall success will depend on a limited number of products and services, which may cause variability and
unsteady profits and losses depending on the products and services offered. 

Our
potential revenues and our profitability may be adversely affected by economic conditions and changes in the market. Our business is
also subject to general economic risks that could adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition. 

6 

Because
of the anticipated nature of the products and services that we will attempt to develop, it is difficult to accurately forecast revenues
and operating results and these items could fluctuate in the future due to several factors. These factors may include, among other things,
the following: 

Our
 ability to raise sufficient capital to take advantage of opportunities and generate sufficient revenues to cover expenses. 

Our
 ability to source strong opportunities with sufficient risk adjusted returns. 

Our
 ability to manage our capital and liquidity requirements based on changing market conditions. 

The
 acceptance of the terms and conditions of our licenses and/or the acceptance of our royalties and fees. 

The
 amount and timing of operating costs and other costs and expenses. 

The
 nature and extent of competition from other companies that may reduce market share and create pressure on pricing and investment
 return expectations. 

Adverse
 changes in the national and regional economies in which we will participate, including, but not limited to, changes in our performance,
 capital availability, and market demand. 

Adverse
 changes in the projects in which we plan to invest which result from factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, a
 change in circumstances, capacity and economic impacts. 

Changes
 in laws, regulations, accounting, taxation, and other requirements affecting our operations and business. 

Our
 operating results may fluctuate from year to year due to the factors listed above and others not listed. At times, these fluctuations
 may be significant. 

Our
independent auditors report for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 have expressed doubts about our ability to continue
as a going concern 

Due
to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating and capital expenses, in our audited annual financial statements as of
and for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, our independent auditors included a going concern qualification in their report regarding
concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have incurred recurring losses and have generated limited revenue since
inception. These factors and our need for additional financing to effectively execute our business plan raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. The presence of the going concern note to our financial statements may have an adverse impact
on the relationships we are developing and plan to develop with third parties as we continue the commercialization of our products and
could make it challenging and difficult for us to raise additional financing, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our
business and prospects and result in a significant or complete loss of your investment. 

Management
of growth will be necessary for us to be competitive 

Successful
expansion of our business will depend on our ability to effectively attract and manage staff, strategic business relationships, and shareholders.
Specifically, we will need to hire skilled management and technical personnel as well as manage partnerships to navigate shifts in the
general economic environment. Expansion has the potential to place significant strains on financial, management, and operational resources,
yet failure to expand will inhibit our profitability goals. 

We
are entering a potentially highly competitive market 

The
markets for the healthcare and senior monitoring industries are competitive and evolving. We face strong competition from larger companies
that may be in the process of offering similar products and services to ours. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer
operating histories, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and larger client bases than we have or expect to
have in the near future. 

7 

Given
the rapid changes affecting the global, national, and regional economies generally, and the healthcare industry specifically, we may
not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Our success will depend on our ability to keep pace with
any market, legal and regulatory changes as well as competitive pressures. Any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to such
changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, liquidity and cash flow. 

If we fail to establish and maintain an effective
system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud, and any inability to report
and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the future trading price of our common
stock 

Effective
internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reporting and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial
reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed,
and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any current internal control deficiencies
may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and access to capital. 

We
currently have insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the SEC disclosure requirements. Additionally, there is a lack of formal process and timeline for
closing the books and records at the end of each reporting period and such weaknesses restrict the Company s ability to timely
gather, analyze and report information relative to the financial statements. 

Because
of the Company s limited resources, there are limited controls over information processing. There is inadequate segregation of
duties consistent with control objectives. Our Company s management is composed of a small number of individuals resulting in
a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation, we would need to hire additional
qualified staff. 

The
Company s failure to continue to attract, train, or retain highly qualified personnel could harm the Company s business 

The
Company s success also depends on the Company s ability to attract, train, and retain qualified personnel, specifically those
with management and product development skills. In particular, the Company must hire additional skilled personnel to further the Company s
research and development efforts. Competition for such personnel is intense. If the Company fails in attracting new personnel, or retaining
and motivating the Company s current personnel, the Company s business could be harmed. 

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock 

Because
we will likely issue additional shares of our common stock, investment in our Company could be subject to substantial dilution 

Investors 
interests in our company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share when we issue
additional shares. We are currently authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock, 0.001 par value per share. As of
November 13, 2023, there were 69,298,198 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. We anticipate that all or at least some
of our future funding, if any, will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. If we do sell more common
stock, investors investment in our company will likely be diluted. Dilution is the difference between what you pay for your
stock and the net tangible book value per share immediately after the additional shares are sold by us. If dilution occurs, any
investment in the Company s common stock could seriously decline in value. 

8 

Trading
in our common stock on the OTC Pink has been subject to wide fluctuations 

Our
common stock is currently quoted for public trading on the OTC Pink market. The trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide
fluctuations. Trading prices of our common stock may fluctuate in response to several factors, many of which will be beyond our
control. The stock market has generally experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or
disproportionate to the operating performance of companies with no current business operation. There can be no assurance that
trading prices and price earnings ratios previously experienced by our common stock will be matched or maintained. These broad
market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In
the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class-action litigation
has often been instituted. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs for us and a diversion of
management s attention and resources. 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws provides for indemnification of officers and directors at our expense and limit their liability,
which may result in a major cost to us and hurt the interests of our shareholders due to corporate resources being expended for the
benefit of officers and/or directors 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws include provisions that fully eliminate the personal liability of our directors for monetary
damages to the fullest extent possible under the laws of the State of Nevada or other applicable law. These provisions eliminate the
liability of our directors and our shareholders for monetary damages arising out of any violation of a director of his fiduciary duty
of due care. Under Nevada law, however, such provisions do not eliminate the personal liability of a director for (i) breach of the director s
duty of loyalty, (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, (iii) payment
of dividends or repurchases of stock other than from lawfully available funds, or (iv) any transaction from which the director derived
an improper benefit. These provisions do not affect a director s liabilities under the federal securities laws or the recovery
of damages by third parties. 

We
do not intend to pay dividends on any investment in the shares of common stock of our Company and any gain on an investment in our
Company will need to come through an increase in our stock s price, which may never happen 

We
have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and currently do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future.
To the extent that we require additional funding currently not provided for in our financing plan, our funding sources may prohibit
the payment of a dividend. Because we do not intend to declare dividends, any gain on an investment in our company will need to come
through an increase in the price of our common shares. This may never occur and investors may lose all their investment in our
company. 

Because
our securities are subject to penny stock rules, you may have difficulty reselling your shares 

Our
shares, as penny stocks, are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which imposes additional sales practice
requirements on broker/dealers who sell our company s securities, including the delivery of a standardized disclosure document;
disclosure and confirmation of quotation prices; disclosure of compensation the broker/dealer receives; and furnishing monthly account
statements. These rules apply to companies whose shares are not traded on a national stock exchange, trade at less than 5.00 per share,
or who do not meet certain other financial requirements specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

These
rules require brokers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors 
to complete certain documentation, make suitability inquiries of investors, and provide investors with certain information concerning
the risks of trading in such penny stocks. These rules may discourage or restrict the ability of brokers to sell our shares of common
stock and may affect the secondary market for our shares of common stock. These rules could also hamper our ability to raise funds in
the primary market for our shares of common stock. 

FINRA
sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock 

In
addition to the penny stock rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (known as FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing
that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional
customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status,
investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that
speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers
to recommend that their customers buy our common shares, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect
on the market for our shares.

The
foregoing risk factors are not a complete list or explanation of the risks involved with an investment in our securities. Additional
risks will likely be experienced that are not presently foreseen by the Company. Prospective investors must not construe this
information provided herein as constituting investment, legal, tax or other professional advice. Before making any decision to
invest in our securities, you should read this entire Annual Report and consult with your own investment, legal, tax and other
professional advisors. An investment in our securities is suitable only for investors who can assume the financial risks of an
investment in the Company for an indefinite period and who can afford to lose their entire investment. The Company makes no
representations or warranties of any kind with respect to the likelihood of the success or the business of the Company, the value of
our securities, any financial returns that may be generated or any tax benefits or consequences that may result from an investment

This
discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated financial statements, financial condition, liquidity, and cash
flows of Healthcare Integrated Technologies, Inc, for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 and the interim periods included
herein. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included
elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 

Executive
Overview 

Healthcare
Integrated Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries is a healthcare technology company based in Knoxville, Tennessee. We are creating
a diversified spectrum of healthcare technology solutions to integrate and automate the continuing care, home care and professional healthcare
spaces. 

Our
initial product, SafeSpace with AI Vision , is an ambient fall detection solution designed for continuing care communities
and at home use. SafeSpace includes hardware devices utilizing RGB, radar and other sensor technology coupled with our internally developed
software to effectively monitor a person remotely. In continuing care communities, SafeSpace detects resident falls and generates alerts
to a centralized, intelligent dashboard without the use of wearable devices or any action by the resident. In the home, SafeSpace detects
falls and sends alerts directly to designated individuals. 

We
recently introduced and are currently pilot testing two additional products - SafeFace and SafeGuard . SafeFace provides
fully automated and ambient time and attendance reporting for facility staff, and an integrated and automatic agency invoice reconciliation
feature. SafeGuard is a novel fully ambient elopement detection and alerting system based on our facial recognition technology. 

In
addition to our current product offerings, we are developing a home concierge healthcare service application to provide a virtual assisted
living experience for seniors, recently released postoperative patients, and others. The concierge application will enable the consumer
to obtain home healthcare services and health and safety monitoring equipment to improve quality of life. We are also working to develop
a fully integrated solution for the professional healthcare community that integrates electronic health records, remote patient monitoring,
telehealth, and other items where integration is beneficial. 

12 

Strategy 

Our
mission is to grow a profitable healthcare technology company by focusing on our core product, continuing the development of our proprietary
software, and developing new uses and product lines for our technology. Our management team is focused on maintaining financial flexibility
and assembling the right complement of personnel and outside consultants required to successfully execute our mission. 

Financial
and Operating Results 

We
continue to utilize funds raised from the private sales of our common stock, issuance of debt, and short-term advances from related
parties to provide cash for our operations, which has allowed us to continue refining our initial product and readying it for pilot
testing, developing future product offerings and adding talented individuals to our management team. Highlighted achievements
for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 include: 

An
 independent director was appointed to our Board of Directors. G. Shayne Bench was appointed to our Board of Directors on August 26,
 2022. Mr. Bench is co-founder and Chief Financial Officer of Trillium Healthcare Consulting and brings a wealth of experience and
 knowledge in the senior living industry to the Company. 

We
 received 300,000 in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock at an average price of 0.10 per share. The net proceeds were
 used to pay off existing debt and provide working capital. 

At
 the option of the holders, convertible debt with a face amount of 150,000 and related accrued interest of 37,586 was converted
 into common shares of the Company. The conversion reduced short-term debt and increased equity by 187,586. 

We
 issued a new promissory note to Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC, a related party, and received 372,069 in net proceeds. The net proceeds
 were used to retire the principal balance and related accrued interest under a promissory note to AJB Capital Investments, LLC. The
 new promissory note allows for greater flexibility and significantly reduces the risk and consequences of a default. 

Our
 executive officers agreed to accept common stock as full or partial payment of all compensation owed under their respective
 compensation agreements as of July 31, 2023. Accrued compensation totaling 2,053,006 was paid in common stock of the Company at a
 weighted average agreed up value of 0.104 per share. The transaction significantly improved our balance sheet by reducing current
 liabilities and increasing equity by the 2,053,006 amount. 

We
 introduced two new products - SafeFace and SafeGuard. SafeFace provides fully automated and ambient time and attendance
 reporting for facility staff, and an integrated and automatic agency invoice reconciliation feature. SafeGuard is a novel fully ambient
 elopement detection and alerting system based on our facial recognition technology. 

On
 August 8, 2023, we announced a strategic alliance with Signature HealthCARE Signature ). The alliance aims to
 implement a series of pilot programs during the coming fiscal year. The collaboration will involve several new proprietary, fully
 ambient AI-based solutions to be pilot tested and deployed across multiple Signature senior living facilities. Signature is a
 family-based healthcare company that offers integrated services in 10 states across the continuum of care, including skilled
 nursing, rehabilitation, assisted living, memory care, home health, cognitive care, and telemedicine.

Officers 
Salaries - Officers salaries, net of capitalized amounts, decreased 9,900 from 2022, or 2 . The decrease resulted from a
bonus being paid to our CFO in 2022. 

Professional
Fees - Professional fees increased 51,666, or 55 , over the 2022 amount. In 2023, expense for outside consultants increased 31,860,
legal fees increased 17,224, and transfer agent and Edgar/XBRL processing fees increased 4,358. The increases were partially offset
by a decrease in accounting fees of 1,776 over the 2022 amount. 

Advertising
and Marketing - Advertising and marketing expense decreased 30,351, or 83 , over 2022. The decrease is primarily due to a contract
sales and marketing position in 2022 that was eliminated in 2023. 

Amortization
 - Amortization expense increased 5,670, or 51 , over the same period in the prior year. The increase primarily results from the
abandonment of a patent in 2023. 

Other
 - Other expense decreased 7,087, or 42 , over the same period in the prior year. The decrease primarily relates to lower travel
and entertainment related expenses in 2023. 

Stock-based
Compensation - Stock-based compensation expense decreased 186,495, or 39 , from the same period in the prior year. The decrease
results from a 2023 reduction in the amortization of the grant date fair value of employee stock options granted to our CEO, CFO and
CTO, and a restricted stock grant to our CFO. The decreases were partially offset by the expense related to the issuance of new shares
and restricted stock grants to outside consultants.

Interest
Expense - Interest expense decreased 30,282, or 7 , over the same period in the prior year. The decrease primarily resulted from
a decrease in the amortization of debt discount related to the AJB Note 2 as it became fully amortized in the third quarter of 2023.
The decrease was partially offset by an increase in the monthly coupon interest on the larger principal balance and fees associated with
extending the maturity date of the AJB Note 2. 

14 

Change
in Fair Value of Derivative Liability - The change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities associated with our AJB Capital
notes reflects a current period gain of 76,451 as compared to a gain of 224,667 in the prior year. The current year gain resulted from
the elimination of the derivative liability on the AJB Capital note when it was paid off in June of 2023.

 (3,116,111 

Current
assets for the year ended July 31, 2023 decreased 3,164 as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. The increase is due to a
decrease in cash and cash equivalents and the amortization of prepaid expenses. 

Current
liabilities for the year ended July 31, 2023 decreased 1,583,975 as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. The decrease is
primarily due to the reduction in accrued compensation related to executive compensation agreements being wholly or partially paid in
common stock during 2023. Additional decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, short-term debt, and the elimination of the
derivate liability associated with debt that was paid off during the period contributed to the overall decrease. 

Net
Cash Used by Operating Activities 

We
currently do not have a revenue source and will continue to have negative cash flow from operations for the near future. The factors
in determining operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, except for non-cash expenses such as depreciation
and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of debt discount, and changes in fair value of assets and liabilities, which
affect earnings but do not affect operating cash flow. Net cash used by operating activities was 106,203 for the year ended July 31,
2023 as compared to 212,177 for the year ended July 31, 2022. The 105,974 decrease in cash used by operating activities during 2023
is primarily attributable to accrued interest expense and professional fees and an overall effort by management to reduce operating costs. 

Net
Cash Used by Investing Activities 

Net
cash used by investing activities was 27,560 and 32,690 for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount is comprised
of cash paid for the filing of patent applications and for the development of software for our internal use. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 133,123 for the year ended July 31, 2023, which represents a 101,352 decrease over the prior
year. New loan proceeds decreased 133,317 in 2023 over the 2022 amount and in 2023 we repaid an additional 246,070 in debt over the
2022 debt repayments. The decreases were partially offset by a 2023 increase in cash received from common stock subscriptions of 275,000
over the 2022 amount. 

At
this time, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding from debt financings and/or
the sale of our equity securities to meet our obligations over the next twelve months. We are likely to continue using short-term loans
from management to meet our short-term funding needs. We have no material commitments for capital expenditures as of July 31, 2023. 

15 

Going
Concern Qualification 

We
have a history of losses, an accumulated deficit, negative working capital and have not generated cash from operations to support a meaningful
and ongoing business plan. Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm has included a Going Concern Qualification 
in their report for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022. The foregoing raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. We intend on financing our future activities and working capital needs largely from the sale of private
and/or public equity securities with additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes, until such time
that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. There is no guarantee that additional capital
or debt financing will be available when and to the extent required, or that if available, it will be on terms acceptable to us. The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Going
Concern Qualification might make it substantially more difficult to raise capital. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires
the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets,
liabilities, revenues and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external
disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying
accounting assumptions adhere to U.S. GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of
our financial statements. 

Our
significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements. 

We
believe the following critical policies impact our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements. 

Business
Combinations 

We
account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets
and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and that changes thereafter be
reflected in income (loss). The estimation of fair values of the assets and liabilities assumed involves several estimates and assumptions
that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded. The results of the acquired businesses are included in our results from
operations beginning from the day of acquisition. 

Risk
and Uncertainties 

Factors
that could affect our future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from management s expectation include,
but are not limited to: our ability to maintain and secure adequate capital to fund our operations and fully develop our product(s);
our ability to source strong opportunities with sufficient risk adjusted returns; acceptance of the terms and conditions of our licenses
and/or the acceptance of our royalties and fees; the nature and extent of competition from other companies that may reduce market share
and create pressure on pricing and investment return expectations; changes in the projects in which we plan to invest which result from
factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, a change in circumstances, capacity and economic impacts; changes in laws,
regulations, accounting, taxation, and other requirements affecting our operations and business. Negative developments in these or other
risk factors could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

16 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. We base our estimates on experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis and actual results may differ from those estimates. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between
market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as
follows: 

Level
1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the
measurement date. 

Level
2 Inputs - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets
or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as
interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market
data by correlation or other means. 

Level
3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity s own assumptions
about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. 

Financial
instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and borrowings. The fair value of current financial
assets and current financial liabilities approximates their carrying value because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments. 

Intangible
Assets 

Intangible
assets consist of patents, our website and the costs of software developed for internal use. Certain payroll and stock-based compensation
costs incurred are allocated to the intangible assets. We determine the amount of costs to be capitalized based on the time spent by
employees or outside contractors on the projects. Intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful life on a straight-line
basis. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. If the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining life is changed,
the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

Long-lived
assets such as property, equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever facts and circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When required, impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized
based on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets,
if available, or independent appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment
loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. 

Derivative
Liability 

Options,
warrants, convertible notes, or other contracts, if any, are evaluated to determine if those contracts, or embedded components of those
contracts, qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, (paragraph 815-10-05-4
and Section 815-40-25). The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is marked-to-market
each balance sheet date and recorded as either an asset or a liability. The change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements
of operations as other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or cancellation of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked
to fair value at the date of conversion, exercise, or cancellation and then the related fair value is reclassified to equity. 

17 

In
circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated, and there are also other
embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments
are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument. 

The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed
at the end of each reporting period. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification
are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. Derivative instrument liabilities will
be classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument
is expected within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 

The
Company adopted Section 815-40-15 of the FASB ASC Section 815-40-15 to determine whether an instrument (or an
embedded feature) is indexed to the Company s own stock. Section 815-40-15 provides that an entity should use a two- step approach
to evaluate whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock, including evaluating the
instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions. 

We
utilize a binomial option pricing model to compute the fair value of the derivative liability and to mark to market the fair value of
the derivative at each balance sheet date. We record the change in the fair value of the derivative as other income or expense in the
consolidated statements of operations. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Revenue
is recognized under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method. Under
this method, the Company follows the five-step model provided by ASC Topic 606 in order to recognize revenue in the following manner:
1) Identify the contract; 2) Identify the performance obligations of the contract; 3) Determine the transaction price of the contract;
4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 5) Recognize revenue. An entity recognizes revenue for the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. The Company s revenue recognition policies remained unchanged as a result of the adoption
of ASC 606, and there were no significant changes in business processes or systems. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation 
 ASC 718 which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation. It
defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. The Company accounts for compensation
cost for stock option plans, if any, in accordance with ASC 718. 

Stock-based
payments, excluding restricted stock, are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Grants of stock-based payment awards issued
to non-employees for services rendered have been recorded at the fair value of the stock-based payment, which is the more readily determinable
value. The grants are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally the vesting period. If
an award is granted, but vesting does not occur, any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed in the period related to the
termination of service. Stock-based compensation expenses are included in cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses,
depending on the nature of the services provided, in the consolidated statements of operations. Stock-based payments issued to placement
agents are classified as a direct cost of a stock offering and are recorded as a reduction in additional paid in capital. 

18 

The
Company recognizes all forms of stock-based payments, including stock option grants, warrants and restricted stock grants, at their fair
value on the grant date, which are based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. 

Capital
Resources 

We
had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of July 31, 2023. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of July 31, 2023 or 2022. 

ITEM
7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We
do not hold any market risk sensitive instruments. We consider our interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of fixing interest
rates on 100 of our debt. At July 31, 2023, there was no floating rate debt that would expose us to market fluctuations in interest
rates.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, at the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation
Date ). In conducting its evaluation, management considered the material weaknesses described below in Management s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

Based
on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the Evaluation Date we did not
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that were effective in providing reasonable assurances that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange act of 1934 was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
prescribed by SEC rules and regulations, and that such information was accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions.

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2023.
Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of July 31, 2023, our internal controls
over financial reporting were not effective. 

In
making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that, as of July 31, 2023, our internal control over financial
reporting is not effective based on these criteria. Material weaknesses noted by our management include: 

Lack
 of a functioning audit committee; 

Lack
 of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring
 of required internal controls and procedures; 

Inadequate
 segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and affecting the functions of authorization, recordkeeping, custody of
 assets, and reconciliation; 

Management
 dominated by a single individual/small group without adequate compensating controls. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules
of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act,
during our most recently completed fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

 associated with persons engaged in any such activity;

 Act), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons
 associated with a member. 

Mr.
Boruff served as a member of the Board of Directors, as Chief Executive Officer, and as Executive Chairman of Miller Energy Resources,
Inc. during the two years preceding Miller Energy Resources, Inc. s filing of a bankruptcy petition in August 2015. 

Mr.
Lobetti served as Treasurer of Miller Energy Resources, Inc. during the two-year period preceding Miller Energy Resources, Inc. s
filing of a bankruptcy petition in August 2015. 

Except
as set forth in the Company s discussion below in Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence ,
none of the Company s directors or executive officers has been involved in any transactions with the Company or any of the Company s
directors, executive officers, affiliates, or associates which are required to be disclosed pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Commission. 

Compliance
with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act 

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company s directors, executive officers and persons who beneficially own 10 or more of
a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial
ownership with the SEC. Directors, executive officers and greater than 10 stockholders are required by the rules and regulations of
the SEC to furnish the Company with copies of all reports filed by them in compliance with Section 16(a). 

Based
solely on our review of certain reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the reports required to be filed with respect to transactions in our common stock during the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, were timely filed. 

Term
of Office 

The
Company s directors are elected by the Company s stockholders for a one-year term until the next annual general meeting of
the Company s stockholders, or until removed by the stockholders in accordance with the Company s bylaws. The Company s
officers are appointed by the Board and hold office until removed by the Board. 

23 

Code
of Ethics 

The
Company does not currently have a code of ethics, and because the Company has only limited business operations and only four officers
and one director, the Company believes that a code of ethics would have limited utility. The Company intends to adopt such a code of
ethics as the Company s business operations expand and the Company has more employees. 

Board
Committees 

As
we only have two board members and given our limited operations, we do not have separate or independent audit or compensation committees.
Our Board of Directors has determined that it does not have an audit committee financial expert, as that term is defined
in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. In addition, we have not adopted any procedures by which our shareholders may recommend nominees
to our Board of Directors. 

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. 

The
following table summarizes all compensation recorded by us in the past two years for: 

our
 principal executive officer or other individual serving in a similar capacity, 

our
 three most highly compensated executive officers, other than our principal executive officer, who were serving as executive officers

cause or for good reason. If the Contract CEO Agreement is terminated by us for cause, upon the death or disability of Mr. Boruff, at

B. Lobetti, III, CFO 

Charles
B. Lobetti, III and the Company entered into a three-year Employment Agreement dated October 8, 2019, in which Mr. Lobetti agreed to
serve as our Chief Financial Officer. As compensation, we agreed to pay him an annual salary of 52,000 and he is entitled to discretionary
bonuses as may be awarded from time to time by our Board of Directors. Effective May 1, 2020, Mr. Lobetti s base salary was increased
to 104,000 to reflect an increased time commitment. As additional compensation we granted him stock options to purchase 600,000 shares
of our common stock at an exercise price of 0.15 per share, which was the closing price of common stock as reported on the OTC Markets
on the date immediately preceding the date of the Employment Agreement. The options vested 25 immediately upon execution of the Employment
Agreement with the remaining vesting equally in annual installments over three (3) years. The vesting date of any unvested options accelerates
in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Employment Agreement). Mr. Lobetti is also entitled to paid vacation and sick
leave, an automobile allowance and participation in any employee benefit plans or programs we may offer. The initial term of the Employment
Agreement will automatically renew for an additional one-year term unless either party provides notice of non-renewal. Mr. Lobetti s
Employment Agreement expired on October 8, 2022 and automatically renewed for the additional one-year term. 

25 

The
Employment Agreement terminates upon the death or disability of Mr. Lobetti, and may be terminated by us for cause, or by Mr. Lobetti

he is only entitled to receive base salary accrued but not paid through the date of termination, and in the case of termination due to
death or disability, a pro rata payment of the annual incentive earned for the year of termination. If the Employment Agreement is terminated
by us without cause or by Mr. Lobetti for good reason, we are obligated to pay him severance equal to one year s base salary and
any unpaid incentive compensation. In addition, if at any time during the term of the Employment Agreement Mr. Lobetti s employment
is terminated by us without cause within two years after a Change in Control of our company, or in the 90 days prior the Change in Control
at the request of the acquiror, we are obligated to pay him an amount equal to 2.99 times his annualized compensation. Change
in Control is defined in the Employment Agreement to mean the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of our securities
representing greater than 50 of the combined voting power of our then outstanding voting securities. The Employment Agreement contains
customary invention assignment, non-compete and non-solicitation provisions.

2,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 0.30 per share, which was the closing price of common stock as reported
on the OTC Markets on the date immediately preceding the date of the Employment Agreement. The options vested 25 immediately upon execution
of the Employment Agreement with the remaining vesting equally in annual installments over three (3) years. The vesting date of any unvested
options accelerates in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Employment Agreement). Mr. Greenwood is also entitled to paid
vacation and sick leave, and participation in any employee benefit plans or programs we may offer. The initial term of the Employment
Agreement will automatically renew for an additional one-year term unless either party provides notice of non-renewal. Mr. Greenwood s
Employment Agreement expired on June 15, 2023 and automatically renewed for the additional one-year term. 

The
Employment Agreement terminates upon the death or disability of Mr. Greenwood, and may be terminated by us for cause, or by Mr. Greenwood
for any reason. If the Employment Agreement is terminated by us for cause, upon his death or disability, at non-renewal or by Mr. Greenwood,
he is only entitled to receive base salary accrued but not paid through the date of termination, and in the case of termination due to
death or disability, a pro rata payment of the annual incentive earned for the year of termination. If the Employment Agreement is terminated
by us without cause or by Mr. Greenwood for good reason, we are obligated to pay him severance equal to one year s base salary
and any unpaid incentive compensation. In addition, if at any time during the term of the Employment Agreement Mr. Greenwood s
employment is terminated by us without cause within two years after a Change in Control of our company, or in the 90 days prior the Change
in Control at the request of the acquiror, we are obligated to pay him an amount equal to 2.99 times his annualized compensation. Change
in Control is defined in the Employment Agreement to mean the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of our securities
representing greater than 50 of the combined voting power of our then outstanding voting securities. The Employment Agreement contains
customary invention assignment, non-compete and non-solicitation provisions.

bonuses as may be awarded from time to time by our Board of Directors. As additional compensation we granted her stock options to purchase

 As
 used in this table, beneficial ownership means the sole or shared power to vote, or to direct the voting of, a security,
 or the sole or share investment power with respect to a security (i.e., the power to dispose of, or to direct the disposition of
 a security). The inclusion of any shares as deemed beneficially owned does not constitute an admission of beneficial ownership by
 the named stockholder. 

11) 
 Unless
 otherwise indicated, we have been advised that all individuals or entities listed have the sole power to vote and dispose of the
 number of shares set forth opposite their names. For purposes of computing the number and percentage of shares beneficially owned by
 a security holder, any shares which such person has the right to acquire within 60 days of November 13, 2023 are deemed to be
 outstanding, but those shares are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other
 security holder. We currently do not maintain any equity compensation plans. As of November 13, 2023, there were 75,398,198 shares
 beneficially owned. 

Changes
in Control 

We
are not aware of any arrangements that may result in changes in control as that term is defined by the provisions of Item
403(c) of Regulation S-K. 

28 

ITEM
13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE. 

Other
than compensation arrangements, the following is a description of transactions to which we were a participant or will be a participant
to, in which: 

the
 amounts involved exceeded or will exceed the lesser of 1 of our total assets or 120,000; and 

any
 of our directors, executive officers or holders of more than 5 of our capital stock, or any member of the immediate family of the
 foregoing persons, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 

To
continue operations and meet operating cash requirements, we have periodically relied on advances from related parties, primarily shareholders,
until such time as our cash flow from operations meets our cash requirements or we are able to obtain adequate financing through sales
of our equity securities and/or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by shareholders.
Amounts advanced primarily relate to amounts paid to vendors. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized
by any written agreement. As of July 31, 2023 and 2022, related parties were owed 328,819 and 267,765, respectively. The amounts owed
are payable on demand and carry no interest. The amounts and terms of the related party advances may not necessarily be indicative of
the amounts and terms that would have been incurred had comparable transactions been entered into with independent third parties. 

Effective
May 1, 2021, we entered into a Non-Employee Chief Executive Officer Engagement Agreement (the Contract CEO Agreement with
Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC, a related party, to provide the services of our CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Under the
terms of the Contract CEO Agreement, Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC was owed 225,000 and 373,500 at July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

On
June 12, 2023, we issued a Promissory Note to Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC in the principal amount of 372,069. The note, plus accrued
interest, is due on December 12, 2023. At July 31, 2023, the principal amount of the note remained 372,069 and accrued but unpaid interest
was 5,064 . The amount and terms of the related party note may not necessarily be indicative of the amount and terms that would
have been incurred had comparable transactions been entered into with independent third parties. 

Director
Independence 

We
currently have no independent directors. Because our common stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange, we have
used the definition of independence of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2)
provides that an independent director is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual
having a relationship that, in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent
judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent
if: 

the
 director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the Company; 

the
 director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the Company in excess of 120,000 during any period of
 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including,
 among other things, compensation for board or board committee service); 

29 

a
 family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer of the Company; 

the
 director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling stockholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to
 which the Company made, or from which the Company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed
 5 of the recipient s consolidated gross revenue for that year or 200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions); 

the
 director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three
 years, any of the executive officers of the Company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or 

The
 director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the Company s outside auditor, or at any time during the
 past three years was a partner or employee of the Company s outside auditor, and who worked on the Company s audit. 

The
Company does not currently have a separately designated audit, nominating, or compensation committee.

14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES.

following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 Healthcare
Integrated Technologies, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Healthcare Integrated Technologies, Inc. (the Company as
of July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for each
of the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2023 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
the Company as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its consolidated operations and its consolidated cash flows for each of
the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has a history of losses, an accumulated deficit, has negative working capital and
has not generated cash from operations to support a meaningful and ongoing business plan. Management s evaluation of the events
and conditions and management s plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter.

 NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 July
31, 2023 and 2022 

. 

Level
3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity s own assumptions
about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. 

Financial
instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and borrowings. The fair value of current financial
assets and current financial liabilities approximates their carrying value because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments. 

. 

The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed
at the end of each reporting period. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification
are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. Derivative instrument liabilities will
be classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is expected
within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 

The
Company adopted Section 815-40-15 of the FASB ASC Section 815-40-15 to determine whether an instrument (or an
embedded feature) is indexed to the Company s own stock. Section 815-40-15 provides that an entity should use a two- step approach
to evaluate whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock, including evaluating the
instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions. 

We
utilize a binomial option pricing model to compute the fair value of the derivative liability and to mark to market the fair value of
the derivative liability at each balance sheet date. We record the change in the fair value of the derivative liability as other income
or expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 

The
Company had a derivative liability of - 0 - and as July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

and for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are included in selling, general
and administrative expenses on the consolidated financial statements. 

for its most recent fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. As of July
31, 2023, the Company has minimal cash and a significant working capital deficit. We have a history of losses, an accumulated deficit,
have negative working capital and have not generated cash from our operations to support a meaningful and ongoing business plan. It is
management s opinion that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

In
view of these matters, our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the development, marketing and sales of a viable
product to achieve a level of profitability. We intend to finance our future development activities and our working capital needs largely
from the sale of private and public equity securities with additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term
notes, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. Although the Company believes
in the viability of management s strategy to generate sufficient revenue, control costs and the ability to raise additional capital,
there can be no assurances to that effect. Therefore, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should
we be unable to continue as a going concern.

In
assessing the realizable value of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become tax deductible. Based on management s assessment
of objective and subjective evidence, we have concluded at this time it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax asset will
not be realized and we have provided a valuation allowance for the entire amount of the deferred tax asset. At July 31, 2023, we have
approximately million in federal and state net operating loss carryovers that begin . 

We
conduct business solely in the United States and file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction as well as in the
states of Tennessee and Colorado. The taxable years ended July 31, 2023 through 2018 remain open to examination by the taxing jurisdictions
to which we are subject. 

The
Company evaluated the provisions of ASC 740 related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s
financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, present, and disclose uncertain positions
that the Company has taken or expects to take in its tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not
to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return
and the net benefit recognized and measured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to as unrecognized benefits. A
liability is recognized (or amount of net operating loss carry forward or amount of tax refundable is reduced) for unrecognized tax benefit
because it represents an enterprise s potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized
as a result of applying the provisions of ASC 740. 

If
applicable, interest costs related to the unrecognized tax benefits are required to be calculated and would be classified as Other expenses
 Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Penalties would be recognized as a component of General
and administrative. 

material interest or penalties on unpaid tax were recorded during the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022. As of July 31, 2023 and 2022,
 liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported. The Company does not expect any significant changes in its unrecognized
tax benefits in the next year.
