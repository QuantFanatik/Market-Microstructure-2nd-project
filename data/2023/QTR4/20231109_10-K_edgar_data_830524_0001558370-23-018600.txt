 Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements, including without limitation forward-looking statements made under the caption Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained in this Annual Report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements as to our future operating results; our pending merger, seasonality expectations; plans for the development, utilization or disposal of manufacturing facilities; future economic conditions; our expectations as to legal proceedings; the effect of our market and product development efforts; and expectations or plans relating to the implementation or realization of our strategic goals and future growth, including through potential future acquisitions. Forward-looking statements may also include, among other things, statements relating to future sales, earnings, cash flow, results of operations, use of cash and other measures of financial performance, statements relating to future dividend payments, as well as public health issues, including epidemics or pandemics such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the Company s businesses and the impact of inflation and other market forces. Forward-looking statements may be identified through the use of words such as believes, anticipates, may, should, will, plans, projects, expects, expectations, estimates, predicts, targets, forecasts, strategy, and other words of similar meaning in connection with the discussion of future operating or financial performance. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industries in which we operate, and the beliefs and assumptions made by management. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Accordingly, the Company s actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Investors, therefore, are cautioned against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Readers should refer to the discussions under Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company has used non-GAAP financial measures in Part III in this Form 10-K. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAX are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAX are useful performance measures as they are used by its executive management team to measure operating performance, to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of its business, to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies and to communicate with its board of directors and investors concerning its financial performance. The Company believes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAX are commonly used by financial analysts and others in the industries in which the Company operates, and thus provide useful information to investors. However, Chase s calculation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures published by others. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the Company s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 PART I Item 1 Busines s Primary Operating Divisions and Facilities and Industry Segments Chase Corporation (the Company, Chase, we, or us ), a global specialty chemicals company founded in 1946, is a leading manufacturer of protective materials for high-reliability applications across diverse market sectors. Our strategy is to maximize the performance of our core businesses and brands while seeking future opportunities through strategic acquisitions. Through investments in facilities, systems and organizational consolidation we seek to improve performance and gain economies of scale. We are organized into three reportable operating segments: an Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment, an Industrial Tapes segment and a Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment. The segments are distinguished by the nature of the products manufactured and how they are delivered to their respective markets. The Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment offers innovative and specialized product offerings consisting of both end-use products and intermediates that are generally used in, or integrated into, another company s product. Demand for the segment s product offerings is typically dependent upon general economic conditions. The Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment leverages the core specialty chemical competencies of the Company and serves diverse markets and applications. The segment sells predominantly into the transportation, appliances, medical, personal care, general industrial and environmental market verticals. The segment s products include moisture protective coatings and cleaners, and customized sealant and adhesive systems for electronics, polymeric microspheres, polyurethane dispersions, specialty polymers and superabsorbent polymers. Beginning September 1, 2022 (first day of fiscal 2023), the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment includes the acquired operations of NuCera Solutions NuCera ), within the functional additives product line. The Industrial Tapes segment features wire and cable materials, specialty tapes and other laminated and coated products. The segment derives its competitive advantage through its proven chemistries, its diverse specialty offerings and the reliability its supply chain offers to end customers. These products are generally used in the assembly of other manufacturers products, with demand typically dependent upon general economic conditions. The Industrial Tapes segment sells mostly to established markets, with some exposure to growth opportunities through further development of existing products. Markets served include cable manufacturing, utilities and telecommunications, and electronics packaging. The segment s offerings include insulating and conducting materials for wire and cable manufacturers, laminated durable papers, laminates for the packaging and industrial laminate markets, custom manufacturing services, pulling and detection tapes used in the installation, measurement and location of fiber optic cables and water and natural gas lines and cover tapes essential to delivering semiconductor components via tape-and-reel packaging. The Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment is principally composed of project-oriented product offerings that are primarily sold and used as Chase branded products. End markets include new and existing infrastructure projects on oil, gas, water and wastewater pipelines, highways and bridge decks, water and wastewater containment systems, and commercial buildings. The segment s products include protective coatings for pipeline applications, coating and lining systems for waterproofing and liquid storage applications, adhesives and sealants used in architectural and building envelope waterproofing applications, high-performance polymeric asphalt additives, and expansion joint systems for waterproofing applications in transportation and architectural markets. With sales generally dependent on outdoor project work, the segment experiences highly seasonal sales patterns. Our manufacturing facilities are distinct to their respective segments apart from our O Hara Township, PA, Blawnox, PA and Hickory, NC facilities, which manufacture products related to a combination of operating segments.

 Human Capital Management Chase Corporation s success derives from its dedicated employees worldwide, who are responsible for the operations, innovation and ethics core to our business and its future. As of August 31, 2023, we employed approximately 859 people (including union employees). Of these, 82 were U.S. based and 18 international. 31 of our employees worked in administrative, selling and research and development functions, while 69 worked in the manufacture of our products at our facilities. Given macrotrends faced worldwide, Chase currently operates in an increasingly competitive landscape in hiring and retaining a manufacturing labor force. We consider our employee relations to be good. In the U.S., we offer our employees a wide array of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive relative to others in our industry. In our operations outside the U.S., we offer benefits that may vary from those offered to our U.S. employees due to customary local practices and statutory requirements. We have policies in place designed to provide a safe and healthy workplace and comply with applicable safety and health regulations and our own internal requirements. We work to provide and maintain a safe, healthy and productive workplace, in consultation with our employees, by addressing and remediating identified risks of accidents, injury and health impacts. We strive to maintain workplace environments that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, sex, color, national or social origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression, political opinion, or any other status protected by applicable law. The qualities and characteristics we seek for recruitment, hiring, placement, development, training, compensation, and advancement at the Company are job qualifications, performance, skills, and experience. Respect for human rights is a fundamental value of the Company. Chase strives to respect and promote human rights in accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in our relationships with our employees, customers, suppliers, and vendors. Our aim is to further advance human rights within the communities in which we operate. The Chase Corporation Human Rights and Supplier Code of Conduct policies and statements on Safety Performance, Environmental Impact and Energy and Resources are available on our website (www.chasecorp.com). Backlog, Customers and Competition As of August 31, 2023, the backlog of customer orders believed to be firm was approximately 42,920,000. This compared with a backlog of approximately 40,600,000 as of August 31, 2022. The increase in backlog from the prior year amount was primarily due to NuCera Solutions increasing the balance for the current year. We continue to work with our customers, vendors and supply chain partners to prioritize the flow of goods. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, no customer accounted for more than 10 of sales. No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination of profits or contracts at the election of the United States Federal Government. There are other companies that manufacture or sell products and services similar to those made and sold by us. Many of those companies are larger and have greater financial resources than we have. We compete principally on the basis of technical performance, service reliability, quality and price. Raw Materials We obtain raw materials from a wide variety of suppliers, with alternative sources of most essential materials available within reasonable lead times.

 Item 1A Risk Factors The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We feel that any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, industry, financial position or our future financial performance. While we believe that we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, operations, industry, financial position and financial performance in the future. Operational and Competitive Risks We currently operate in mature markets where increases or decreases in market share could be significant. Our sales and net income are largely dependent on sales from a consistent and well-established customer base. We have used and will continue to use strategic acquisitions as a means to build and grow the business. In this business environment, increases or decreases in market share could have a material effect on our business condition or results of operation. We face intense competition from a diverse range of competitors, including operating divisions of companies much larger and with far greater resources than we have. If we are unable to maintain our market share, our business could suffer. Fluctuations in the supply and prices of raw materials may negatively impact our financial results. We obtain raw materials needed to manufacture our products from a number of suppliers. Many of these raw materials are petroleum-based derivatives. Under normal market conditions, these materials are generally available on the open market and from a variety of producers. From time to time, however, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate (as was experienced in the second half of fiscal 2021 and in the fiscal 2022 period), which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing our products. If the prices of raw materials increase, and we are unable to pass these increases on to our customers, we could experience reduced profit margins. If our products fail to perform as expected, or if we experience product recalls, we could incur significant and unexpected costs and lose existing and future business. Our products are complex and could have defects or errors presently unknown to us, which may give rise to claims against us, diminish our brands or divert our resources from other purposes. Despite testing, new and existing products could contain defects and errors and may in the future contain manufacturing or design defects, errors or performance problems when first introduced, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period of time. These problems could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, changes to our manufacturing processes, product recalls, significant increases in our maintenance costs, or exposure to liability for damages, any of which may result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, require significant management attention, damage our reputation and customer relationships, and adversely affect our business, our operating results and our cash flow. The Company s results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by public health issues, including epidemics or pandemics such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We face various risks related to public health issues, including epidemics, pandemics, and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic had created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The Company experienced lower sales as a result of the economic disruption (most acutely in the first half of fiscal 2021), and initiated cost-saving measures, including a targeted workforce reduction in 2020, in response to the uncertainties associated with the scope and duration of the pandemic. The extent to which public health issues, including epidemics or pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, impact the Company s business, operations and financial results in future periods will depend on numerous evolving factors that it may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; future domestic and international waves and variants seen in public health issues, like COVID-19 and current vaccines effectiveness

Table of Contents 
 against such variants; governmental, business and individuals actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on its customers demand for its goods and services and its vendor s ability to supply it with raw materials; its ability to sell and provide goods and services, including as a result of travel restrictions and people working from home; the ability of its customers to pay for goods and services; and any closures of its customers offices and facilities. Customers may also slow down decision-making, delay planned work or seek to terminate existing agreements. Further, the effects of public health issues like a pandemic may also increase the Company s cost of capital or make additional capital more difficult or available only on terms less favorable to it. A sustained downturn may also result in the carrying value of the Company s goodwill or other intangible assets exceeding their fair value, which may require it to recognize an impairment to those assets. A sustained downturn in the financial markets and asset values may have the effect of increasing the Company s pension funding obligations in order to ensure that its qualified pension plan continues to be adequately funded, which may divert cash flow from other uses. We may experience difficulties in the redesign and consolidation of our manufacturing facilities which could impact shipments to customers, product quality, and our ability to realize cost savings. We currently have several ongoing projects to streamline our manufacturing operations, which include the redesign and consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities in order to reduce overhead costs. Despite our planning, we may be unable to effectively leverage assets, personnel, and business processes in the transition of production among manufacturing facilities. Uncertainty is inherent within the facility redesign and consolidation process, and unforeseen circumstances could offset the anticipated benefits of these streamlining projects, disrupt service to customers, and impact product quality. Strategic Risks We face risks associated with the Merger. On July 21, 2023, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Formulations Parent Corporation, an affiliate of investment funds managed by KKR, and Merger Sub. The consummation of the Merger is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of our shareholders, which we received on October 6, 2023, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. The 30-day waiting period under the HSR Act expired on September 5, 2023. Consummation of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. Although we are not aware of any conditions that would cause the Merger not to be consummated, there is no assurance that the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. Additionally, if the Merger is not completed, we may suffer a number of consequences that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and stock price. There are numerous risks related to the Merger, including the following: Various conditions of the Merger may not be waived or satisfied; The Merger may not be consummated, which among other things may cause our share price to decline to the extent that the current price reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed; The failure to consummate the Merger may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community; Required regulatory approvals from governmental entities may delay the Merger; Our ability to attract, recruit, retain and motivate current and prospective employees may be adversely affected; The attention of our employees and management may be diverted due to activities related to the Merger;

Table of Contents 
 Disruptions from the Merger, whether or not it is completed, may harm our relationship with our employees, customers, distributors, suppliers, or other business partners, and may result in a loss of or a reduction in purchases by our customers; and The Merger Agreement restricts us from engaging in certain actions without Parent s approval, which could prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities outside the ordinary course of business that arise prior to the closing of the Merger. In addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, and those fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether the Merger is consummated. Our business strategy includes the pursuit of strategic acquisitions, which may not be successful if they happen at all. From time to time, we engage in discussions with potential target companies concerning potential acquisitions. In executing our acquisition strategy, we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates. In addition, we may face competition from other companies for acquisition candidates, making it more difficult to acquire suitable companies on favorable terms. We have historically financed larger acquisitions with additional borrowings under our bank credit agreements. Our credit agreement places certain restrictions on our ability to acquire other businesses, and imposes certain financial covenants on us that may limit our ability to borrow. If we incur additional indebtedness in order to finance an acquisition, that indebtedness may reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes, may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions, and may expose us to the risk of increased interest rates. If we finance an acquisition through the issuance of equity securities, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders would be proportionately diluted. Even if we do identify a suitable acquisition target and are able to negotiate and close a transaction (as we did in fiscal 2023 for NuCera and fiscal 2021 for both ABchimie and the operations of Emerging Technologies, Inc. ETI )), the integration of an acquired business into our operations involves numerous risks, including potential difficulties in integrating an acquired company s product line with ours; the diversion of our resources and management s attention from other business concerns; the potential loss of key employees; limitations imposed by antitrust or merger control laws in the United States or other jurisdictions; risks associated with entering a new geographical or product market; and the day-to-day management of a larger and more diverse combined company. We may not realize the synergies, operating efficiencies, market position or revenue growth we anticipate from acquisitions, and our failure to effectively manage the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth prospects and financial performance. International Risks If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in expanding our international operations. Our strategy includes expansion of our operations in existing and new international markets by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances. Our ability to successfully execute our strategy in international markets is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in expanding our U.S. operations. In addition, our international expansion may be adversely affected by our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers as well as by local laws and customs, legal and regulatory constraints, political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. Risks inherent in our international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, domestic and international tariffs and trade policies and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations.

 Current and threatened tariffs on goods from China and other countries could result in lower revenue, profits and cash flows. The Company imports raw materials from China, makes sales of finished goods into China and has manufacturing operations in China. The Company works to lower the potential negative effects of the tariffs through seeking alternative sources for our raw materials, when available and pragmatic, and, in certain cases, through altering our manufacturing logistics by utilizing non-U.S. manufacturing where tariffs do not apply. While we also attempt to pass on these additional costs to our customers, competitive factors (including competitors who import from other countries not subject to such tariffs) may limit our ability to sustain price increases and, as a result, may adversely impact our revenue, profits and cash flows. In addition, the imposition of tariffs may influence the sourcing habits of certain end users of our products which, in turn, could have a direct impact on the requirements of our direct customers for our products. Such an impact could adversely affect our revenue, profits and cash flows. Industry Risks Our results of operations could be adversely affected by uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers businesses and levels of business activity. Global economic and political conditions can affect the businesses of our customers and the markets they serve. A severe or prolonged economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect, among others, the automotive, housing, construction, pipeline, energy, transportation, infrastructure or electronics industries. This may reduce demand for our products or depress pricing of those products, either of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions or foreign and domestic trade policy could also shift demand to products for which we do not have competitive advantages, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes and our business could be negatively affected. General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may also adversely affect our financial performance through increased raw material costs or other expenses and by making access to capital more difficult. The cumulative effect of higher interest rates, energy costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, unsettled financial markets, and other economic factors (including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes to federal, state, local and international tax laws or the application or enforcement practices of such laws) could adversely affect our financial condition by increasing our manufacturing costs and other expenses at the same time that our customers may be scaling back demand for our products. Prices of certain commodity products, including oil and petroleum-based products, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, weather events and climate change, regional and global public health crises, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors can increase our cost of products and services sold and/or selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operating results. Disruptions in the credit markets may limit our ability to access debt capital for use in acquisitions or other purposes on advantageous terms or at all. If we are unable to manage our expenses in response to general economic conditions and margin pressures, or if we are unable to obtain capital for strategic acquisitions or other needs, then our results of operations would be negatively affected. Other Risks We are dependent on key personnel. We depend significantly on our executive officers including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Adam P. Chase, and on other key employees. The loss of the services of any of these key employees could have a material impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, our acquisition strategy will require that we attract, motivate and retain additional skilled and experienced personnel. We have experienced in the past, and may continue to experience, an

 increasingly competitive landscape relating to obtaining and retaining a manufacturing labor force. The inability to satisfy such requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to remain competitive in the future. Financial market performance may have a material adverse effect on our pension plan assets and require additional funding requirements. Significant and sustained declines in the financial markets may have a material adverse effect on the fair market value of the assets of our qualified pension plan. While these pension plan assets are considered non-financial assets since they are not carried on our balance sheet (i.e. the balance sheet reflects only the net of plan assets and obligations), the fair market valuation of these assets could impact our funding requirements, funded status or net periodic pension cost. Any significant and sustained declines in the fair market value of these pension assets could require us to increase our funding requirements, which would have an impact on our cash flow, and could also lead to additional pension expense. If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, this may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock. We are required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to include a report by our independent auditors attesting to such effectiveness. Any failure by us to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report accurately our financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent auditors determine that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, also could restrict our future access to the capital markets. Failure or compromise of security with respect to an operating or information system or portable electronic device could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or the effectiveness of our internal controls over operations and financial reporting. We are highly dependent on automated systems to record and process our daily transactions and certain other components of our financial statements. Notwithstanding efforts to ensure the integrity of our automated systems, we could experience a failure of one or more of these systems, or a compromise of our security due to technical system flaws, data input or recordkeeping errors, or tampering or manipulation of our systems by employees or unauthorized third parties. Information security risks also exist with respect to the use of portable electronic devices, such as laptops and smartphones, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft. We could be subject to disruptions of any of these systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, epidemics, pandemics, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, malware, ransomware, and electrical/telecommunications outages). All of these risks are also applicable wherever we rely on outside vendors to provide services. Operating system failures, disruptions, or the compromise of security with respect to operating systems or portable electronic devices (with information technology security threats increasing in frequency and sophistication) could subject us to liability claims, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations, or adversely affect our business, results from operations, financial condition, cash flow or internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 3 Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in litigation incidental to the conduct of its business. Although the Company does not expect that the outcome in any of these matters, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, litigation is inherently unpredictable. Therefore, judgments could be rendered, or settlements agreed to, that could adversely affect the Company s operating results or cash flows in a particular period. The Company routinely assesses all its litigation and threatened litigation as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records its best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where it assesses the likelihood of loss as probable. item 4 mine safety disclosures Not applicable.

 denotes less than one percent Note: Some percentage of revenue amounts may not sum due to rounding Executive Overview Results of Operations The Company s revenue grew in fiscal 2023, with the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives and Industrial Tapes operating segments surpassing revenue achieved in fiscal 2022. The increase in revenue for fiscal 2023 was primarily attributed to inorganic growth from our NuCera Solutions NuCera business acquired in the first month of fiscal 2023 and our electronic and industrial coatings product line (included within our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives operating segment) coupled with revenue generated by our cable materials, specialty products and pulling and detection product lines (included within our Industrial Tapes operating segment). Tempering the overall increase in fiscal 2023 revenue was decreased demand seen in our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing operating segment.

 The Company s gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 36.0 in fiscal 2023 compared to 37.8 in fiscal 2022. Despite the Company s sales growth in fiscal 2023, the Company continues to have less favorable gross margin compared to the comparable prior fiscal period. The decrease in gross margin percentage in the fiscal period is primarily attributed to lower gross margin from our NuCera business. Additionally, the Company s gross margin was negatively impacted by customer destocking caused by customer inventory reduction initiatives seen in the first half of fiscal 2023. After being negatively impacted by inflationary pressures in fiscal 2022, the gross margin for our organic business has stabilized due to measures implemented in fiscal 2022, including sales price increases fully realized in fiscal 2023 and the Company s supply chain strategy to actively explore secondary sourcing initiatives to locate alternative suppliers for our critical raw materials. Inflationary pressures did not have a significant impact on our profitability in the fiscal year. The Company s operating expenses increased in the year-to-date period over the comparable prior period. The increase in operating expenses is attributable to the inclusion of expenses from our NuCera business including purchase accounting adjustments such as additional amortization expected to recur in future periods and backlog intangible that was fully amortized during the first fiscal quarter, acquisition-related costs related to the merger agreement dated July 21, 2023, and lease impairment and write-off of long-term assets, all of which negatively impacted operating income over the fiscal 2023 period. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Chase Corporation s balance sheet remained healthy as of August 31, 2023, with cash on hand of 49,019,000, and a current ratio of 4.4. The Company s cash position remained steady including cash flow from operations and debt paydown. The Company s disciplined inventory reduction approach in the fiscal period has continued to allow the Company to make subsequent payments on our long-term debt and improve cash flow. Furthermore, during the second fiscal quarter Chase Corporation paid out an annual cash dividend of 9,500,000 on December 9, 2022. The Company had 105,000,000 outstanding balance on its 200,000,000 revolving credit facility as of August 31, 2023, related to the funding of the NuCera acquisition as noted above. The Company made 75,000,000 in principal payments related to the outstanding balance over the course of fiscal 2023. Pending Merger On July 21, 2023, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub. See Business Other Business Developments Merger Agreement in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.

 Results of Operations Revenue Total revenue increased 78,355,000, or 24.1 to 404,015,000 for the year ended August 31, 2023, compared to 325,660,000 in fiscal 2022. Out of the 78,355,000 increase in fiscal 2023 revenue, 89 relates to inorganic revenue from our NuCera business and the remaining increase in revenue is primarily attributable to sales price increases fully realized in fiscal 2023. Revenue by Segment The Company has three reportable operating segments summarized below:

 Total Revenue Revenue for our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment increased in fiscal 2023 over the comparable prior year period. The segment revenue increased 72,130,000, or 53 to 207,900,000 for the year ended August 31, 2023 compared to 135,770,000 in fiscal 2022. The year-to-date increase in revenue was predominately due to the inorganic growth from our NuCera business acquired on the first day of fiscal 2023, totaling 69,669,000. The remaining increase in revenue for the fiscal period was primarily attributed to sales price increases realized over the comparable fiscal year and increased demand for our world-wide focused electronic and industrial coatings product line, totaling 10,808,000. Partially offsetting this increase in revenue in the fiscal year-to-date period was a reduction in revenue in our organic functional product line due to decreased customer demand in North America over the comparable prior fiscal year, totaling 8,347,000. Revenue for our Industrial Tapes segment increased in fiscal 2023 over the comparable prior year period. The segment revenue increased 9,706,000, or 6.7 to 153,660,000 for the year ended August 31, 2023 compared to 143,954,000 in fiscal 2022. Sales price increases realized over the prior year and increased demand for our North American-focused specialty products, pulling and detection, and cable materials product lines increased fiscal 2023 revenue by 11,710,000. Partially offsetting this increase in revenue in the fiscal year was a year-to-date reduction in sales volume from our Asia-focused electronic materials product line, totaling 2,004,000. Revenue in the Company s Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment decreased 3,481,000, or 7.6 to 42,455,000 for the year ended August 31, 2023 compared to 45,936,000 in fiscal 2022. Negatively impacting sales for the segment in the fiscal year was a reduction in sales volume for our building envelope product line related to customer destocking due to prior year demand attributed to customer inventory increase initiatives in reaction to supply chain shortages, totaling 4,147,000. Also negatively impacting sales for the segment for the fiscal year was our pipeline coatings product line predominately due to delayed projects in the Middle East market over the prior comparable period coupled with customer destocking initiatives in North American oil and gas markets, totaling 927,000. Partially offsetting the decrease in revenue was our coating and lining systems product line, with a revenue increase of 1,283,000, attributed to sales price increases realized over the prior year and increased demand seen in the last quarter of the fiscal year due to the commencement of delayed projects affected by the extended rainy season seen in the west coast of North America. Also, partially offsetting the decrease in revenue was our bridge and highway product line, with a revenue increase of 310,000, predominately due to sales price increases realized over the prior year coupled with increased demand seen in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the commencement of bridge and highway projects in North America. Royalties and commissions in the Adhesive, Sealants and Additives segment totaled 3,133,000 and 3,198,000 for the year ended August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in royalties and commissions in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to decreased demand seen in our electronic and industrial coatings products by our licensed manufacturer in Asia. Cost of Products and Services Sold Cost of products and services sold increased 55,866,000 or 27.6 to 258,574,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023 compared to 202,708,000 in fiscal 2022. The following table summarizes the relative percentages of cost of products and services sold to revenue for our three operating segments: 

Fiscal Years Ended August 31, Cost of products and services sold 2023 2022 2021 Adhesives, Sealants and Additives 64 59 57 Industrial Tapes 65 67 64 Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing 58 57 57 Total Company 64 62 62

 Cost of products and services sold in the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment was 133,484,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023 compared to 80,619,000 in fiscal 2022. Cost of products and services sold in the Industrial Tapes segment was 100,264,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023 compared to 96,132,000 in fiscal 2022. Costs of products and services sold in the Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment was 24,826,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023 compared to 25,957,000 in fiscal 2022. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold increased in fiscal 2023 for both the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives and Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment as compared to the prior comparable period. The decrease in relative gross margin for our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment was impacted by lower historical gross margin from our NuCera business. The decrease in relative gross margin for the Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to decreased production affecting overhead variances. As a percentage of revenue, costs of products and services sold decreased for the Industrial Tapes segment in fiscal 2023 due to sales price increases realized in the current fiscal period coupled with increased demand. With the composition of the Company s finished goods and the markets it serves, the costs of certain commodities (including petroleum-based solvents, films, yarns, polymers and nonwovens, aluminum and copper foils, specialty papers, and various resins, adhesives and inks) directly and indirectly affect both the purchase price of our raw materials and the market demand for our product offerings. In an effort to preserve margins, the Company diligently monitors raw material and commodities pricing across all its product lines in its efforts to preserve margins. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 22,679,000 or 41.7 to 77,117,000 during fiscal 2023 compared to 54,438,000 in fiscal 2022. The year over year increase in activity is attributed to the inclusion of expenses from our NuCera business (including additional amortization expected to recur in future periods and backlog intangible that was fully amortized during the first fiscal quarter), which was acquired on the first day of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses represented 19 and 17 of total revenue in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Research and Product Development Costs Research and product development costs increased 1,620,000 or 36.7 to 6,035,000 during fiscal 2023 compared to 4,415,000 in fiscal 2022. The year over year increase in research and product development costs is primarily related to our NuCera business, which was acquired in the first month of fiscal 2023. Operations Optimization Costs ERP System Upgrade The Company recognized 1,476,000 in operations optimization costs during fiscal 2023 and 0 in fiscal 2022, related to the ERP system upgrade.

 NuCera-related fixed asset disposals In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company wrote off 492,000 and 3,000, related to a discontinued engineering design study and fixed asset disposal from our Barnsdall, OK facility, respectively. Loss on Contingent Consideration As part of the September 1, 2020 (fiscal 2021) acquisition of ABchimie, the Company incurred a performance-based earn out liability potentially worth an additional 7,000,000 (approximately 8,330,000 at the time of the transaction) in consideration. Following its initial recording of an accrual for 928,000 at the acquisition date, the Company recorded charges of 702,000, 432,000 and 1,664,000 in expenses related to adjustments to the performance-based earn out accrual were recorded during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Interest Expense Interest expense of 8,981,000 was recognized in fiscal 2023 compared to 425,000 in fiscal 2022. The year over year increase in interest expense relates to our outstanding long-term debt which was used to fund our NuCera business acquisition at the beginning of fiscal 2023. Other Income (Expense) Other (expense) income was an expense of 1,435,000) in fiscal 2023 compared to income of 198,000 in the comparable period, a difference of 1,633,000. Other (expense) income primarily includes foreign exchange gains (losses) caused by changes in exchange rates on transactions or balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, non-service cost components of periodic pension expense (including pension-related settlement costs due to the timing of lump-sum distributions), interest income, rental income and other non-trade/non-royalty/non-commission receipts. The year over year change in total other (expense) income was largely due to the recognition of a foreign exchange loss in fiscal 2023 as compared to a foreign exchange gain in fiscal 2022. Income Taxes The Company s recognized effective tax rate was 23.2 and 23.8 in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company is utilizing the 21 Federal tax rate enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act passed in December 2017. Please see Note 7 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the effects of the Tax Act. Net Income Net income decreased 11,489,000 or 25.7 to 33,182,000 in fiscal 2023 compared to 44,671,000 in fiscal 2022. The decrease in net income is predominately caused by an increase in operating expenses and interest expense in fiscal 2023. The increase in operating expenses includes incremental depreciation and amortization related to our NuCera business, lease impairment/write-off of right of use asset, and first quarter purchase accounting adjustments related to the NuCera acquisition, which include backlog fully amortized during the first fiscal quarter all of which negatively impacted net income over the comparable prior year. Liquidity and Sources of Capital The Company s overall cash and cash equivalents balance decreased 266,476,000 to 49,019,000 at August 31, 2023 compared to 315,495,000 at August 31, 2022. The lower year over year cash balance was primarily attributed to the 180,000,000 of cash drawn from the revolving credit facility prior to the end of fiscal 2022, the proceeds of which were used, together with 70,000,000 in cash on hand, to fund the acquisition of NuCera which closed on September 1, 2022 (the first day of fiscal 2023). In addition, the Company made 75,000,000 of principal debt payments. The decrease in cash balance at August 31, 2023 is offset by cash provided by operations of 74,336,000.

 Of the above-noted balances, 28,350,000 and 28,951,000 were held outside the United States by Chase Corporation and its foreign subsidiaries as of August 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively. Given the Company s cash position and borrowing capability in the United States and the potential for increased investment and acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions, prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2018 the Company did not have a history of repatriating a significant portion of its foreign cash. With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, significant changes in the Internal Revenue Code were enacted, changing the U.S. taxable nature of previously unrepatriated foreign earnings. Following the passage of the Tax Act, the Company repatriated 10,499,000 in U.K. foreign earnings in fiscal 2018 and 17,230,000 in fiscal 2019. No additional amounts were repatriated in fiscal year 2020, 2021, or 2022. The Company repatriated 11,458,000 in U.K. foreign earnings in fiscal 2023. Please see Note 7 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the effects of the Tax Act. Cash flow provided by operations was 74,336,000 in fiscal year 2023 compared to 34,859,000 in fiscal 2022. The increase in cash provided by operations year over year was primarily related to increase in revenue, mainly driven by our NuCera business and reduction on inventory spend. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 4.4 as of August 31, 2023 compared to 12.4 (or 7.3 excluding the 180,000,000 cash drawn from our revolving credit facility to fund the NuCera acquisition) as of August 31, 2022. The decrease in the ratio of current assets to current liabilities is primarily due to the cash outflow of 250,000,000 to fund the acquisition of NuCera mentioned above. Cash flow used in investing activities of 257,231,000 was primarily due to the purchase of NuCera, which occurred on the first day of fiscal 2023. Cash flows used in financing activities of 85,418,000 was due to principal payments (totaling 75,000,000) on our long-term debt related to the funding of the NuCera acquisition mentioned above. Please see note 6 Long-Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the Company s credit facility. Additionally, the cash flows used in financing activities was due to a cash dividend of 1.00 per share (totaling 9,500,000) to shareholders of record on November 30, 2022 and paid on December 9, 2022, the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company s Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto, which is used to provide for additional liquidity to finance acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement includes a revolving credit loan (the Revolving Facility ), with borrowing capabilities not to exceed 200,000,000 at any time, with the ability to request an increase in this amount by an additional 100,000,000 at the individual or collective option of any of the Lenders. As of August 31, 2023, the Company had 105,000,000 in long-term debt related to the acquisition of NuCera Solutions that closed on September 1, 2022. The long-term debt has a weighted average interest rate of 6.43 as of August 31, 2023. See Note 6 Long Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the Credit Facility. We expect the Credit Facility to be paid off in connection with the Merger. The Company has several ongoing capital projects, including upgrading the Company s ERP system, as well as its facility rationalization and consolidation initiative, which are important to its long-term strategic goals. Machinery and equipment may be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in the Company s production facilities. We may acquire companies or other assets in future periods which are complementary to our business. The Company believes that its existing resources, including cash on hand and the Credit Agreement, together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings, will be sufficient to fund its cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing, if needed, will be available on favorable terms, if at all. To the extent that interest rates increase in future periods, we will assess the impact of these higher interest rates on the financial and cash flow projections of our potential acquisitions.

 We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements. Contractual Cash Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at August 31, 2023 under operating leases and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands): 

Payments Due Contractual Obligations Total 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 and thereafter Operating leases 7,170 1,664 1,439 1,101 738 553 1,675 Total 7,170 1,664 1,439 1,101 738 553 1,675 We may be required to make payments related to our unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. The Company s unrecognized tax benefits was 1,895,000 as of August 31, 2023. See Note 7 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We also expect to make payments as needed to satisfy our funding obligations for our obligations for pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. As of August 31, 2023, we had recognized an accrued benefit plan liability of 5,679,000 representing the unfunded obligations of the pension benefit plans. See Note 9 Benefits and Pension Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information, including expected pension benefit payments for the next 10 years. The Company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed expected requirements or extend beyond one year. Recently Issued Accounting Standards For discussion of the newly issued accounting pronouncements see Recently Adopted Accounting Standards in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

Table of Contents 
 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies and estimates. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results, and require management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting estimates as those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of a company. Judgments, assumptions, and estimates are used for, but not limited to, the allowances for accounts receivable; inventory allowances; business combinations, goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; revenue; income tax reserves; deferred income taxes; stock-based compensation; as well as discount and return rates used to calculate pension obligations. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Business Combinations Business Combinations are recorded using the acquisition method. We assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Any excess of the purchase price is largely attributable to the synergies and economies of scale from combining operations, technologies and research and development capabilities. The Company assesses the fair value of assets, including intangible assets, using a variety of methods, and each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset, including a market participant s use of the asset. Some of the most significant assumptions used include the discount rate, forward-looking financial information, and estimated customer attrition rates. A change in one of these assumptions could have material changes on the value of the intangible assets and goodwill which will impact the amortization expense in future periods and the goodwill impairment evaluation. During the year 2023, a 10 increase or decrease in the value of the intangible assets related to the NuCera acquisition would have decreased or increased the goodwill amount by 14,802,000 and it would have increased or decreased the year-to-date amortization expense by 1,504,000. Transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a transaction to acquire a business are expensed as incurred.

 Item 7a Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Chase limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. At August 31, 2023, other than the Company s restricted investments (which are restricted for use in non-qualified retirement savings plans for certain key employees and members of the Board of Directors), all of the Company s funds were either in demand deposit accounts or investment instruments that meet high credit quality standards, such as money market funds, government securities, or commercial paper. Chase s U.S. operations have limited currency exposure since substantially all transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, the Company s European and Asian operations are subject to currency exchange fluctuations. The Company continues to review its policies and procedures to control this exposure while maintaining the benefit from these operations and sales not denominated in U.S. dollars. The effect of an immediate hypothetical 10 change in the exchange rate between the British pound and the U.S. dollar and the Euro and the U.S. dollar would not have a material direct effect on the Company s overall liquidity. As of August 31, 2023, the Company had cash balances in the following foreign currencies (with USD equivalents in thousands): 

Currency Code Currency Name USD Equivalent at August 31, 2023 GBP British Pound 13,182 EUR Euro 10,316 INR Indian Rupee 1,348 CAD Canadian Dollar 863 CNY Chinese Yuan 448 SGD Singapore Dollar 285 The Company will continue to review its current cash balances denominated in foreign currency in light of current tax guidelines, including the impact of the Tax Act to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, working capital requirements, infrastructure improvements and potential acquisitions. The Company recognized a foreign currency translation gain for the year ended August 31, 2023 in the amount of 5,385,000 related to its European, Asian and Indian operations, which is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) within its Statement of Equity and Statement of Comprehensive Income. The Company does not have or utilize any derivative financial instruments. The Company pays interest on its outstanding long-term debt at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. There was an outstanding balance of long-term debt of 105,000,000 for the year ended August 31, 2023. See Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Sources of Capital, Note 6 Long-Term Debt and Note 16 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our outstanding long-term debt. The effect of an immediate hypothetical 10 change in variable interest rates would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Shareholders Chase Corporation Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Chase Corporation (a Massachusetts corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ), and our report dated November 9, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical audit matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Valuation of the acquisition-date fair value of customer relationships As described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, on September 1, 2023 the Company acquired NuCera Solutions for a total purchase price of 250 million. As part of the transaction, the Company recorded a customer relationships intangible asset of 119 million related to NuCera US customer relationships. We identified the valuation of the acquisition-date fair value of the NuCera US customer relationships as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination that the valuation of the NuCera US customer relationships is a critical audit matter were (i) the significant judgments applied by management in developing forecasted financial information and selecting a customer attrition rate for use in the fair value measurement of acquired customer relationship (ii) the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity required in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions relating to the projected forecasted information including revenue growth rate, weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and customer attrition rate.

 Our audit procedures related to the valuation of the acquisition-date fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset included the following, among others: 
 We tested the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company s estimation process for recognition and measurement of customer relationships. We evaluated the annual customer attrition rate by examining the Company s historical customer attrition data, as well as comparing attrition rates to prior acquisitions. We tested the reasonableness of management s forecasted cash flows by comparing forecasts to historical results, subsequent results, and projected market and industry trends. With the assistance of our valuation specialist, we assessed the key assumptions and methodologies used in valuing the customer relationship, including WACC and customer attrition rates.

 Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost. The Company evaluates the potential impairment of goodwill annually each fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company performs a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. Factors that management considers in this assessment include general economic and industry conditions, overall financial performance (both current and projected), changes in strategy, changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets, and market capitalization. The Company s goodwill is allocated to each reporting unit based on the nature of the products manufactured by the respective business combinations that originally created the goodwill. The Company has identified a total of reporting units, corresponding to its operating segments, that are used to evaluate the possible impairment of goodwill. If this qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company would proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. Under this quantitative analysis, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the Company recognizes an impairment charge. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting unit using the income approach based on a discounted cash flow model. In addition, the Company uses the market approach, which compares the reporting unit to publicly-traded companies and transactions involving similar businesses, to support the conclusions based on the income approach.

 Long-term debt On July 27, 2021 (the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021), the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement by and among the Company and NEPTCO Incorporated NEPTCO ), each as borrowers, the guarantor subsidiaries party thereto, the financial institutions party thereto as Lenders, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, with participation from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., PNC Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Credit Agreement is used to provide for additional liquidity to finance acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement includes a revolving credit loan (the Revolving Facility ), with borrowing capabilities not to exceed at any time, with the ability to request an increase in this amount by an additional at the individual or collective option of any of the Lenders. Effective February 1, 2023, the Credit Agreement transitioned to a secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) in substitution for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and will commence at the next interest rate renewal period. The applicable interest rate for the Revolving Facility and Term Loan (defined below) is based on the effective SOFR base rate plus a SOFR adjustment based on the term of the interest rate period plus a spread ranging from to , depending on the consolidated net leverage ratio of Chase and its subsidiaries. The SOFR adjustment is based on interest rate periods of 1-month at , 3-months at , and 6-months at . Prior to the transition to SOFR, the applicable interest rate for the Revolving Facility and Term Loan was based on the effective LIBOR plus a spread ranging from to , depending on the consolidated net leverage ratio of Chase and its subsidiaries. As of August 31, 2023, the Company had in long-term debt related to the acquisition of NuCera Solutions that closed on September 1, 2022. The long-term debt has a weighted average interest rate of as of August 31, 2023. The Credit Agreement has a term with interest payments due at the end of the applicable LIBOR or SOFR period (but in no event less frequently than the three-month anniversary of the commencement of such LIBOR or SOFR period) and principal payment due at the expiration of the agreement, July 27, 2026. The Company may elect a base rate option for all or a portion of the Revolving Facility, in which case interest payments shall be due with respect to such portion of the Revolving Facility on the last business day of each quarter. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, the Company may elect to convert all or a portion of the outstanding Revolving Facility into a new term loan twice during the term of the Revolving Facility (each, a Term Loan , and collectively with the Revolving Facility, the Credit Facility ), which Term Loan shall be payable quarterly in equal installments sufficient to amortize the original principal amount of such Term Loan on a ten year amortization schedule. The outstanding balance on the Credit Facility is guaranteed by all of Chase s direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, which collectively had a carrying value of approximately at August 31, 2023. The Credit Facility is subject to restrictive covenants under the Credit Agreement, and financial covenants that require Chase and its subsidiaries to maintain certain financial ratios on a consolidated basis, including a consolidated net leverage ratio of no greater than to 1.00 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of no less than to 1.00 (both defined in the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement requires lender permission for acquisitions over a certain size, and allows the company to temporarily modify the consolidated leverage ratio when an acquisition greater than is consummated during an applicable measurement period. Due to the NuCera acquisition, the consolidated leverage ratio was not to exceed to 1.00 as of the end of the four fiscal quarters following the acquisition. Prepayment is allowed by the Credit Agreement at any time during the term of the agreement, subject to customary notice requirements and the payment of customary LIBOR or SOFR breakage fees. Chase Corporation was in compliance with the debt covenants under the Credit Agreement as of August 31, 2023.

 , enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act in December 2017, for fiscal years end August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. In fiscal 2019, the Company began recognizing an additional component of total Federal tax expense, the tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income GILTI provision of the Tax Act, which became applicable to the Company in fiscal 2019. The Company elected to account for GILTI as a period cost, and therefore included GILTI expense in the effective tax rate calculation. This provision did not have a material effect on the effective tax rate for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The Company concluded that the Base Erosion and Anti Abuse Tax BEAT provision of the Tax Act, which also became applicable to the Company in fiscal 2019, had no effect on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021. In July 2020, the United States Internal Revenue Service IRS released final regulations (TD 9901) that ease documentation standards and provide greater flexibility for taxpayers claiming the deduction for Foreign-Derived Intangible Income FDII ).

In addition, during fiscal 2023, the Company recognized of tax benefit due to the expiration of statute of limitations. The Inflation Reduction Act IRA was enacted into law on August 16, 2022. Included in the IRA was a provision to implement a corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income for applicable corporations and a excise tax on repurchases of stock. These provisions are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We are in the process of evaluating the provisions of the IRA, but we do not currently believe the IRA will have a material impact on our reported results, cash flows or financial position when it becomes effective. Domestic and foreign pre-tax income for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was: Foreign

Chase Corporation is required to apply a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the Company determined that a valuation allowance was not needed. Consistent with the Company s practice prior to the passage of the Tax Act, we do not currently take the position that undistributed foreign subsidiaries earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested.

 Supplemental plan Expected long-term return on plan assets Qualified plan Supplemental plan Rate of compensation increase Qualified and Supplemental plan It is the Company s policy to evaluate, on an annual basis, the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation to approximate rates on high quality, long-term obligations. The Moody s Corporate Aa Bond index has generally been used as a benchmark for this purpose, with adjustments made if the duration of the index differed from that of the plan. The discount rate is determined by matching the expected payouts from the respective plans to the spot rates inherent in the FTSE Pension Discount Curve (formerly Citigroup Pension Discount Curve). A single rate is then developed, that when applied to the expected cash flows, results in the same present value as determined using the various spot rates. The Company believes that this approach produces the most appropriate approximation of the plan liability. The Company estimates that each -basis point reduction in the discount rate would result in additional (decreased) net periodic pension cost, the Company s primary pension obligation, of approximately for the Qualified Plan and for the Supplemental Plan. The expected return on plan assets is derived from a periodic study of long-term historical rates of return on the various asset classes included in the Company s targeted pension plan asset allocation. The Company estimates that each -basis point reduction in the expected return on plan assets would result in additional net periodic pension cost of approximately for the Qualified Plan. No rate of return is assumed for the Supplemental Plan since that plan is currently not funded. The rate of compensation increase is also evaluated and is adjusted by the Company, if necessary, periodically. Qualified Plan Assets The investment policy for the Qualified Plan is based on ERISA standards for prudent investing. The fundamental goal underlying the investment policy is to ensure that the assets of the plans are invested in a prudent manner to meet the obligations of the plans as these obligations come due. The primary investment objectives include providing a total return which will promote the goal of benefit security by attaining an appropriate ratio of plan assets to plan obligations, to provide for real asset growth while also tracking plan obligations, to diversify investments across and within asset classes, to reduce the impact of losses in single investments, and to follow investment practices that comply with applicable laws and regulations. The primary policy objectives will be met by investing assets to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between return and risk relative to the plan s obligations. This includes investing a portion of the assets in funds selected in part to hedge the interest rate sensitivity to plan obligations. The Qualified Plan assets are invested in a diversified mix of both domestic and foreign equity investments and fixed income securities. Asset manager performance is reviewed at least annually and benchmarked against the peer universe for the given investment style. The Company s expected return for the Qualified Plan is . To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the assets for the Qualified Plan, the Company considered the historical and expected return on the plan assets, as well as the current and expected allocation of the plan assets.

Item 9a Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company carries out a variety of ongoing procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Company implemented financial internal controls on the operations associated with NuCera, acquired in September 2022, during the year-to-date fiscal 2023 period.

Item 11 Executive Compensation Executive Officer and Director Compensation Compensation Discussion and Analysis Introduction This Compensation Discussion and Analysis is intended to provide a context for the disclosures contained with respect to the compensation paid to our executive officers. Compensation information is presented below for our Executive Chairman, Peter R. Chase, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Adam P. Chase, our Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, Michael J. Bourque and our General Counsel, Jeffery D. Haigh. Collectively, these officers are referred to as our named executive officers. Specifically, this Compensation Discussion and Analysis will explain the objectives and material elements of their compensation during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023. The Compensation and Management Development Committee of our Board of Directors has the responsibility of developing and overseeing a comprehensive compensation philosophy, with strategies and principles that have the support of the Board of Directors and management, and that ensure the fair and consistent administration of our compensation program. The Compensation and Management Development Committee makes recommendations to the full Board for approval relative to the total compensation to be paid to the named executive officers, including salary, performance bonus, equity awards, long-term awards, benefits, and perquisites. The members of the committee are Thomas Wroe, Jr., Chairman, Thomas D. DeByle, and John H. Derby III. Each member of the committee is independent, as independence for Compensation and Management Development Committee members is defined under the listing standards of the NYSE American and the applicable regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Compensation and Management Development Committee operates under a written charter that is available through the Company s website at www.chasecorp.com. In this analysis, we refer to the Compensation and Management Development Committee as the Committee or the Compensation and Management Development Committee. Philosophy and Objectives of Our Compensation Program The primary objectives of the Compensation and Management Development Committee are to ensure that our executive compensation and benefits programs: retain executive talent by offering compensation that is commensurate with pay at other public companies of a similar size in the same or similar industries in the region, as adjusted for individual factors, and considering the complexity of the Company s business; safeguard company interests and the interests of our shareholders; are effective in driving executive performance by having, for members of the senior management team, pay at risk, so actual pay is tied to company-wide goal achievement and superior performance is rewarded; foster teamwork on the part of management; are consistent and competitive with Chase Corporation s compensation peer group;

Table of Contents 
 are cost-efficient and fair to employees, management, and shareholders; and are well-communicated to and understood by program participants. Our Compensation and Management Development Committee believes that the most effective compensation program is one that will provide incentives that are directly linked to the achievement of company strategies through easily measured, company-wide performance targets, while providing a reasonable level of income security to the named executive officers through competitive base salaries and retirement benefits. Our executive compensation reflects a balance of cash and non-cash compensation, and a mix of currently paid compensation and long-term incentives. The Compensation and Management Development Committee does not set a rigid target for these mixes, and the mix will necessarily vary from year to year based upon our underlying financial performance. Our incentive plans combine financial targets to reward performance with time-based vesting to assist retention. Committee Purposes and Responsibilities One of the primary purposes of the Compensation and Management Development Committee is to determine the total target compensation levels for the senior executive officers of the Company and to establish and annually review the programs that will determine the actual rewards as compared to established targets. The Committee is charged with ensuring that the target compensation levels, and the allocation of short-term and long-term components are sufficient to attract, motivate, and retain seasoned professional managers, while at the same time ensuring that the pay is reasonable and fair to our shareholders in light of the Company s financial performance and when compared to executive officers of similar position and responsibility at comparable businesses. The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the annual compensation for service on the Board of Directors or for service as a member or chair of any of the various committees of the Board of Directors, and, when appropriate, recommending any changes to the Board for approval. The Committee has the authority to retain and terminate any legal counsel or any compensation or other consultant to be used to assist in the evaluation of director or executive compensation and has sole authority to approve the consultant s fees or other retention terms. The Committee also reviews and administers our equity compensation plans, and reviews any existing or proposed employment agreement, change in control or severance agreement, or any special or supplemental benefits not offered as part of a broad-based plan that are made available to our named executive officers. Where appropriate, it recommends adoption, amendment, or termination of such programs or agreements to the full Board of Directors. Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions Our Compensation and Management Development Committee makes all determinations affecting the compensation for our named executive officers, including our Executive Chairman and our Chief Executive Officer, and recommends those determinations to the full Board of Directors for approval. Our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may from time-to-time attend meetings of the Committee as non-voting advisory members, except that they are not present for any discussion of their own compensation. The Compensation and Management Development Committee receives and considers our Executive Chairman s and our Chief Executive Officer s evaluations of, and their recommendations as to all elements of compensation of, our Chief Financial Officer and our General Counsel. The Committee expressly reserves the right to exercise its discretion in modifying any adjustments or awards recommended by our Executive Chairman or our Chief Executive Officer, although historically the Committee has given significant weight to these recommendations.

 Use of Compensation Consultants and Benchmarking Data A description of the extent to which we have historically benchmarked our base salary levels against other companies is described below under Principal Elements of our Fiscal 2023 Compensation Program - Base Salary. The Committee has taken advice from expert compensation consultants to set the position values and salary ranges for executive officers. The Committee adjusts base salaries annually for the Company to remain competitive with respect to executive compensation. The compensation consultants have used similar benchmarking data in recommending the performance-based components of the executive compensation package. The Committee most recently engaged a compensation consultant, Pearl Meyer Partners Pearl Meyer in August 2022 for benchmarking purposes in fiscal 2023. Pearl Meyer provided the Committee and management with recommendations based on its review at that time. Prior to this most recent engagement, the Company had last hired Pearl Meyer to perform a similar assessment in 2017. Principal Elements of our Fiscal 2023 Compensation Program The principal elements of compensation for our named executive officers, other than our Executive Chairman, during fiscal 2023 were: base salary; a cash bonus component based on the performance of our business against corporate objectives under our annual cash incentive plan; long term incentive compensation in the form of equity awards including: a restricted stock award based on the performance of our business against different corporate objectives (representing 50 of the total equity component target value); a time-based vesting restricted stock award (representing 25 of the total equity component target value); and stock options (representing 25 of the total equity component target value). In fiscal year 2017 the Committee determined that Peter R. Chase, our Executive Chairman, would not participate in the cash incentive program component of the Company s executive compensation programs. This shift in the allocation of annual pay components for Peter R. Chase away from the cash incentive program reflected a shift in the day-to-day responsibilities of the Executive Chairman following Adam P. Chase s appointment to the Chief Executive Officer role in fiscal 2015. Peter R. Chase has not participated in the Company s equity incentive programs since 2013, in recognition by the Committee of the diminishing incremental benefit of additional equity grants in achieving the shareholder alignment and retention objectives of the equity program considering Mr. Chase s accumulation of equity from prior years of service. The Executive Chairman s compensation for fiscal 2023, therefore, consisted primarily of his salary, as it had in the prior six years. For our named executive officers other than the Executive Chairman, the financial measurement metrics and targets used in both the annual cash incentive plan and the annual equity award plan are subject to annual review by the Committee, which reserves the right to set different objectives on either the cash incentive plan or equity award program as it feels appropriate considering the annual and long-term objectives of the Company. As discussed in more detail below, the Committee utilizes differing financial performance targets for the cash incentive plan and the equity awards program. The two programs also differ in the dollar value of the target awards and in their vesting provisions, since payments under the cash incentive plan are made after the end of each fiscal year, and the equity awards (including those that are subject to additional performance-based vesting criteria) customarily vest over a period of three years from the time of grant. The total compensation packages for our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and General Counsel thus provide a mix of (1) current cash payments in the form of salary, independent of year-to-year financial performance; (2) annual cash payments determined by reference to the Company s actual results of operations for the 
 95 

Table of Contents 
 year compared to a target; and (3) equity awards, subject (in the case of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) to vesting provisions relating to the Company s financial results, together with restricted stock and stock options that are not specifically tied to financial performance, but all of which are subject to time-based vesting provisions in order to foster our retention objectives. The cash incentive plan for fiscal 2023 set target compensation levels with reference to targeted earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), as adjusted to exclude costs and gains or losses related to our acquisitions and divestitures, costs of products sold related to inventory step-up to fair value, settlement gains or losses resulting from lump sum distributions to participants in our defined benefit plans, and other significant items Adjusted EBITDA ), less the effects of foreign transaction gains or loss Adjusted EBITDAX or the Adjusted EBITDA-based target ). The performance-based equity award program sets target compensation levels with respect to a combination of (1) our earnings per share EPS for the fiscal year in question, as adjusted at the discretion of the Committee, and (2) our return on invested capital (ROIC) over a three-year period. Our calculation of each such metric under both plans is described in more detail below. As a result, a substantial proportion of our named executive officers total compensation under both the cash and equity incentive programs is tied to our earnings in each fiscal year. The Committee determined for 2023 that an Adjusted EBITDA-based target is the most appropriate tool for measuring the underlying performance of the Company and its management team for the annual cash incentive plan, while EPS and ROIC are used for the equity plan as they are more common and consistent measures for longer term incentive programs and align with how shareholders are rewarded. In addition, the Committee has chosen to emphasize company-wide achievement of financial objectives in this manner, as opposed to emphasizing more subjective individual performance criteria or measurements based upon business segments or other operating data, because it believes it is important to use a metric that is easily measured and understood from the beginning of the year, that fosters teamwork among the management team, and that most directly aligns the interest of the named executive officers participating in the program with those of all shareholders. The Committee does retain discretion to adjust or supplement the cash incentive awards paid, either upward or downward. The following discussion seeks to explain why the Compensation and Management Development Committee has chosen to pay each compensation element, how it determines the amount of each element, and how the element and the Committee s decisions regarding that element in fiscal 2023 fit into the Company s overall compensation objectives and affect decisions regarding other elements. Base Salary. Each of our named executive officers receives a base salary. The objective is to provide base compensation comparable to base compensation that the executive could earn in a similar position at other companies. To better understand the compensation practices of similar companies, the Compensation and Management Development Committee from time to time, reviews data from a custom peer group. The peer group used for benchmarking 2023 salary ranges was identified by our compensation consultant, Pearl Meyer, in 2022. Peer group information serves as the primary reference point for the Compensation and Management Development Committee with Pearl Meyer market survey data used as a secondary reference in attempting to keep salary ranges competitive.

 The following companies comprised of our peer group for fiscal 2023: Balchem Corporation CSW Industrials, Inc. FutureFuel Corp. GCP Applied Technologies Inc, Hawkins, Inc. Insteel Insutries, Inc. Livent Corporation LSB Industries, Inc. Quaker Chemical Corporation Ramaco Resources, Inc. Ranpak Holdings Corp. Trecora Resources UFP Technologies, Inc. United States Lime Minerals, Inc. 
 This peer group used for benchmarking was developed based on comparability to the Company in terms of industry and size, with data gathered from peer group proxy statements. Cash Incentive Plan . At the beginning of each fiscal year, following the annual budget presentation by management to the Board of Directors, the Committee sets a corporate performance target for the upcoming fiscal year to be used in connection with the Company s incentive compensation programs. For the reasons discussed above, our Executive Chairman does not participate in the cash incentive plan. As noted above, for the cash incentive plan the financial target was established as an Adjusted EBITDA-based target for fiscal 2023. The Adjusted EBITDA-based target was set by the Committee with reference to both historical performance and expected future performance. The Committee believes that the targets set as a general matter should be reasonably attainable through consistent performance as compared to recent years, and it is the Committee s expectation that the actual awards granted under the relevant plan will exceed the target awards where management achieves growth over historical annual Adjusted EBITDAX levels. The Adjusted EBITDA-based targets are set in a way that tends to generally reflect improvement over historical results, at least during periods of multi-year growth in Adjusted EBITDAX. At the end of the fiscal year, actual results are compared to the target established at the beginning of the year. In establishing the compensation program, it is the Board s intent to exclude from actual performance measurements the effect of items generally consistent with items excluded in the Company s historical definition of Adjusted EBITDA. The Committee consequently has the discretion to decide and has decided from time to time in the past, to exclude certain items or to make other adjustments in order to fairly reflect our underlying operating performance for the year.

Table of Contents 
 In order for any amounts to be payable under the plan, the Company must meet a threshold level of 80 of the Adjusted EBITDA-based target for any amounts to be paid as part of the plan. Actual payments are made under the plan by reference to the target awards established by the Committee for each of the named executive officers as a percentage of their base salaries, although they can be subject to adjustment as described below. The maximum award under the cash incentive plan is reached at 120 of the target performance measure. The Company s actual Adjusted EBITDAX was 96.8 million for fiscal 2023 and represented achievement at approximately 81 of the target amount for the year, resulting in the payout of 52.25 of the target award under the cash incentive plan. The reconciliation from net income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDAX for fiscal 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in thousands): 

Year Ended August 31, 2023 2022 Net income 33,182 44,671 Interest expense 8,981 425 Income taxes 10,009 13,927 Depreciation expense 8,906 3,547 Amortization expense 23,666 11,751 EBITDA (1) 84,744 74,321 Loss on contingent consideration 702 432 Operations optimization costs 1,992 842 Acquisition-related costs 4,299 4,000 Purchase accounting adjustments 2,242 Pension settlement loss 213 Loss on impairment/write-off of long-term assets 1,689 Adjusted EBITDA (1) 95,881 79,595 Foreign transaction (gains) losses 961 (442) Adjusted EBITDAX 96,842 79,153 (1) Our calculations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measures, are explained in greater detail in our cautionary note on Form 10-K. As outlined above, Adjusted EBITDAX further excludes the impact of foreign transaction gains or losses. 
 Amounts potentially payable under the cash incentive plan, as a percentage of salary at the beginning of the year, and amounts actually paid are reflected in the table below for fiscal year 2023. Cash Awards Payable for 2023 Actual FY 2023 Payment Award as percentage Final At 80 of At 100 At 120 of annual payments Name of executive target of target of target salary made (as percentage of base salary) Adam P.

Haigh 12.5 25 50 13 34,000 A similar cash incentive program was approved by the Committee and maintained and paid out of a bonus pool, with payments determined by reference to our Adjusted EBITDA-based target, for other key employees at the Company. In fiscal 2023, approximately 584 employees participated in that program, with most payments at the discretion of the Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.

 Equity Incentive Plan. The third element of our compensation program is our equity-based long-term incentive plan. In 2023 our equity incentive plan used a combination of three types of equity awards: performance-based restricted stock, time-vesting restricted stock, and stock options. For the reasons discussed above, Peter R. Chase does not participate in the equity incentive plan. The performance-based element measures annual performance against (1) an earnings per share EPS base target and (2) a return on invested capital ROIC base target (weighted 80 and 20 , respectively, of the total performance-based equity award target value for 2023). The performance-based equity award target represented 50 of the total target equity award value for Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque, and Jeffery D. Haigh for 2023. The other half of the total target equity award value for Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque and Jeffery D. Haigh was split evenly between time-based vesting restricted stock and stock options. The following table shows, for each of the named executive officers participating in the equity incentive plan, the total target equity awards for each officer as determined at the beginning of the fiscal year. 

Target Equity Performance Time Vesting Award as of Value at Shares at Shares at Stock Options at Name Salary (1) Grant Date Grant Date (2) Grant Date (3) Grant Date (4) Adam P. Chase 250 1,530,000 8,677 4,339 11,367 Michael J. Bourque 60 204,600 1,160 580 1,520 Jeffery D. Haigh 50 131,000 743 371 973 (1) Total target equity award as a percentage of salary in the table represents the initial amount determined on September 1, 2022 (the first day of fiscal 2023). (2) Value represents 50 of the total equity award target for Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque and Jeffery D. Haigh assuming achievement at 100 of the performance targets, using the closing share price on the last day of the prior fiscal year. Based upon actual fiscal 2023 financial performance, the total actual payout for the performance share component of the equity compensation plan for fiscal 2023 was 1,124 shares for Adam P. Chase, 150 shares for Michael J. Bourque and 96 shares for Jeffery D. Haigh due to achieving below the performance target, calculated in the manner described under Performance-based restricted stock below. Consequently, 7553, 1010, and 647 stock awards from the original performance grants were forfeited by Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque, and Jeffery D. Haigh, respectively, subsequent to August 31, 2023. (3) Value represents 25 of the total equity award targets for Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque and Jeffery D. Haigh using the closing share price on the last day of the prior fiscal year. (4) Value represents 25 of the total equity award for Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque and Jeffery D. Haigh, using the Black-Scholes value of the options on the last day of the prior fiscal year. In the event of a named executive officer s retirement, death, disability, or dismissal without cause before the scheduled vesting date, the awards will vest pro rata to the date of the termination of employment. In the event of a named executive officer s voluntary termination of employment or termination for cause, all unvested portions of the award will be forfeited. Upon a change of control of the Company, any unvested restricted stock awards will automatically vest, and any unvested stock options may vest at the discretion of the Committee. Each of the three types of equity awards that collectively comprise our equity incentive plan are described in more detail below: Performance-based restricted stock. The performance-based restricted stock awards are made at the beginning of the year based upon the target performance levels, with the target number of shares being determined by dividing the target equity award value by our stock price on the grant date. For fiscal 2023, the EPS target set by the Committee was 5.97 and the ROIC target set by the Committee was 21.4 .

Table of Contents 
 The final award amounts are determined after the end of the fiscal year by reference to our actual performance for the year. For any payments to be made under the EPS component or the ROIC component of the equity incentive plan, the Company must achieve at least 80 of the EPS target or the ROIC target, as applicable. The EPS target was weighted as 80 of the target performance-based equity award, and the ROIC target was weighted as 20 of the target performance-based equity award. If the Company achieves less than 80 of both performance targets, the full award would be forfeited. If the Company achieves 80 of either of the targets, then the actual payment would be 50 of the target shares available under that target (with the other 50 being forfeited). Achievement between 80 and 100 of either target would be pro-rated. If the Company achieves 120 of either target, then the executive s equity award would be 200 of the targeted share amount available under that target. Achievement between 100 and 120 of either target would be pro-rated. The total opportunity is capped at 200 of the targeted share amount. Accordingly, there is no incremental award in 2023 at performance levels above 120 of either target. EPS as defined in the plan may differ from earnings per share as calculated under generally accepted accounting principles, since the plan uses the fully diluted number of shares outstanding as of the first day of the fiscal year and may include other adjustments as determined by the Compensation and Management Development Committee. Our basic and diluted EPS as reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for fiscal 2023 were 3.49 and 3.48 per share, respectively. Using the fully diluted number of shares outstanding as of August 31, 2022, the EPS used for purposes of evaluating performance under the 2023 equity plan was 3.52, or less than the 80 threshold of the target EPS of 5.97. The actual payments made under the EPS performance share component of the plan thus represented 0 of the targeted share amount for that component due to being under the 80 threshold of the target EPS of 5.97. ROIC is defined in the plan as the three-year average earnings before interest expense and income tax, divided by the three-year average of the sum of equity and debt less cash on hand at year-end. The fiscal 2023 target was set as the trailing three-year average ROIC, calculated using the fiscal 2023 budget and fiscal 2022 and 2021 actual results. Actual ROIC for the measurement period was calculated using actual results for the three years ended August 31, 2023. The ROIC used for purposes of evaluating performance under the 2023 equity plan was 18.4 , or approximately 86 of the target ROIC of 21.4 . The actual payments made under the ROIC performance share component of the plan thus represented approximately 64.75 of the targeted share amount for that component. The final share amounts are calculated and approved by the Compensation and Management Development Committee upon finalization of our financial results for the fiscal year. Equity awards made for fiscal 2023 fell below the threshold for the EPS and between the threshold and target levels for ROIC. The restricted stock award under the plan will not vest until the last day of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year that is used as the performance period. In other words, the performance-based equity awards for fiscal 2023 will vest on August 31, 2025. The Committee believes that the combination of performance measures to determine the number of shares of common stock underlying each award, and the cliff vesting of the award two years after the end of the performance period, is useful in accomplishing the dual objectives of rewarding superior performance and encouraging retention of its qualified executives. Time-based vesting restricted stock. The Committee also incorporates time-based vesting shares into our long-term incentive plan for participating executive officers. The purpose of the time vesting restricted stock grant is to provide a long-term incentive in the form of a fixed award that is not subject to a performance measurement target. The number of shares is determined by reference to the value of the award (25 of the total target equity award value for Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque and Jeffery D. Haigh) divided by the closing market price of our common stock on the last day of the prior fiscal year. The shares vest in three years from their grant, or on August 31, 2025. Stock options. The Committee incorporates stock option grants into our long-term incentive plan on a formulaic basis as part of the overall long-term incentive plan for certain executive officers. Thus, 25 of the total target value of the equity plan awards for 2023 for Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque and Jeffery D. Haigh, was made in options to purchase common stock. The purpose of the option grant was to further align the executives interests with that of the shareholders, to encourage equity participation among management team members and provide a long-term incentive for their future commitment as key members of the executive management team. The option grant was made effective as of 
 100 

Table of Contents 
 September 1, 2022, with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. The number of shares of common stock subject to these option grants was determined by taking 25 of the total equity award opportunity and dividing it by the Black-Scholes value of an individual option on the date of grant. The options granted in fiscal 2023 will vest in three equal annual installments, beginning on August 31, 2023. Discretionary Bonuses. The Committee does not consider discretionary cash bonuses to be a material part of the executive compensation program, outside of the cash incentive plan described above. As noted above, the Committee has the discretion to adjust an award determined under the cash incentive plan upward or downward and has exercised that discretion in the prior years in a manner that has historically had a small impact on total compensation compared to the objective components. No such adjustments were made with respect to the fiscal 2023 compensation program. Voting and Dividends on Stock Awards. Participants in the equity award program can vote and receive dividends upon their restricted shares before the shares vest. The Committee has determined that permitting the participants to vote and receive dividends prior to the vesting of the awards was appropriate and consistent with the Committee s retention and pay for performance objectives. The Committee considered the fact that dividends on unvested awards would typically represent a small percentage of the executives total compensation. Dividends paid on unvested awards are not required to be repaid if the vesting provisions are not met, but the underlying shares themselves remain subject to forfeiture through the vesting date, putting the bulk of the economic value of the award at risk and subject to the performance and time-based vesting conditions. Retirement Programs In addition to the primary components of executive pay described above, we maintain certain retirement plans and benefits for our executive officers. Many of these plans are available to larger groups of employees. The Committee feels that the opportunity to participate in programs that assist the executives and other employees in saving for retirement is an important part of those employees compensation package. The named executive officers may elect to make contributions to a retirement account in our Chase Deferred Salary Savings Plan (the 401(k) plan ), which is available to substantially all employees of certain businesses of the Company and under which we made a matching contribution to each participant in each of the last three fiscal years. The matching contribution under the 401(k) plan is the equivalent of 100 of the first one percent of the employee s pre-tax contribution to the plan plus 50 thereafter, up to an amount equal to three and one-half percent of the employee s annual salary. Our matching contributions to the accounts of the named executive officers are shown in the All Other Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table. We also maintain a non-qualified Supplemental Savings Plan covering selected employees, including our named executive officers. Participants may elect to defer a portion of their compensation for future payment in accordance with the terms of the plan. Our Executive Chairman, Peter R. Chase, received a full payout of his non-qualified Supplemental Savings Plan balance in fiscal 2017 after entering a separation of service letter with the Company, reducing the level of services that he performs as the Executive Chairman to no more than 20 of the average level of services performed in the previous 36 months. We maintain a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan and a non-qualified Supplemental Pension Plan. The Supplemental Pension Plan covers those of our employees who from time to time may be designated by our Board of Directors. During fiscal 2023, our Executive Chairman, Peter R. Chase, and our President and Chief Executive Officer, Adam P. Chase, were designated as being covered. These plans are described in more detail under Executive Compensation Other Executive Plans Pension Plans . As noted in that section, benefits are paid at a higher rate to employees who became employed prior to May 1, 1995 or who are covered by certain collective bargaining agreements and meet certain other qualifications, as compared to those who were employed after that date. Our Executive Chairman, Peter R. Chase, began collecting his non-qualified Supplemental Pension Plan balance in fiscal 2017 after entering a separation of service letter with the Company, as noted above.

 Other Benefits The Company owns a life insurance policy on Peter R. Chase as a mechanism available for use to fund obligations of the Company, including the unfunded, non-qualified Supplemental Pension Plan described above. We provide our named executive officers a car allowance of 1,000 per month. We provide our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel with reimbursements for certain financial planning and tax services up to 5,000 per year. Our Compensation and Management Development Committee considers these arrangements to be fair and reasonable considering the relatively low cost to the Company. Named executive officers may also participate in our medical and dental insurance offerings by electing to make payroll deductions designed to cover approximately 35 of the cost of these programs (with the company covering the other 65 of the cost). We also provide disability and life insurance coverage for our named executive officers and pay a portion of the related premiums. Stock Ownership Guidelines The Board of Directors believes that it is important to align the interests of our senior management and directors with those of our shareholders. As described above, the Committee takes this principle into account in designing the compensation programs in which our executive officers participate. The Board has established stock ownership guidelines that encourage the accumulation and retention of our common stock to further foster these objectives. Our current stock ownership guidelines are expressed as a multiple of base salary or, in the case of directors, a multiple of annual cash compensation. Under the guidelines, each of our Executive Chairman and our Chief Executive Officer are required to acquire and hold stock with a fair market value of at least five times base salary. For our Chief Financial Officer, the multiple is three times base salary, and for our General Counsel and other vice presidents, the multiple is one times base salary. Non-employee directors are required to acquire and hold stock with a fair market value of at least five times annual cash compensation. Directors are required to achieve compliance 36 months from the first election to the Board. Newly appointed executives and covered individuals who accept an appointment to a position requiring a higher retention level are required to comply with this policy within 36 months of their appointment (or 60 months in the case of vice presidents). Shares of stock subject to time-based vesting provisions count toward the ownership guidelines but shares subject to performance-based vesting conditions and shares underlying stock options do not count toward the ownership guidelines. The Compensation and Management Development Committee retains the discretion to grant waivers or make exceptions to the policy under appropriate circumstances. The full stock ownership guidelines are available on our corporate website, www.chasecorp.com. Prohibitions on Hedging and Pledging Our insider trading policy specifically prohibits Directors of Chase Corporation, officers, and selected other employees from (a) holding Company securities in a margin account or pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan, or (b) purchasing any financial instruments or entering into any other transactions that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Company s common stock owned directly or indirectly by them (commonly referred to as hedging or entering into certain other speculative transactions. This policy, referred to as the Chase Corporation Responsibilities and Requirements of Directors, Officers and Employees of a Publicly Held Company, is available on our corporate website, www.chasecorp.com. Severance Agreements We have arrangements with our named executive officers pursuant to which they would be entitled to receive severance upon certain enumerated events. The events that trigger payment are generally those related to termination of 
 102 

Table of Contents 
 employment without cause or detrimental changes in the executive s terms and conditions of employment. See Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control below for a more detailed description of these triggering events and the resulting benefits. We believe that this structure will help: (i) assure that the named executive officers can give their full attention and dedication to us, free from distractions caused by personal uncertainties and risks related to a pending or threatened change in control, (ii) assure the named executives objectivity in considering shareholders interests, (iii) assure the named executives of fair treatment in case of involuntary termination following a change in control, and (iv) attract and retain key executive talent in a competitive market. Consideration of the Previous Shareholder Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation At the Company s 2023 annual meeting of shareholders held February 7, 2023, approximately 89 of votes cast at the meeting with respect to the proposal were voted to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers. No specific component of our 2023 executive compensation program was altered based upon this voting result. However, the Committee will continue to monitor shareholder feedback as it reviews and establishes future executive compensation plans and determines awards for our named executive officers. Our Board of Directors determined in 2018 that an advisory vote will be conducted on an annual basis. Compensation Risks The Compensation and Management Development Committee has considered the components of the Company s compensation policies and practices. We believe that risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for our employees, including our executive officers, are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, although a significant portion of executive compensation is performance based and at-risk, the Committee believes that the mix and design of the elements of executive compensation do not encourage management to assume excessive risk. The Committee has reviewed the elements of executive compensation to determine whether any portion of executive compensation encourages excessive risk-taking. It concluded that: the Company s significant weighting toward long-term incentive compensation, including performance targets and time-based vesting provisions used in tandem, discourages excessive risk taking; the Company s performance goals are appropriately identified in order to avoid targets that, if not met, result in a large percentage loss of compensation; assuming achievement of at least a minimum level of performance, payouts under the Company s performance-based plans result in some compensation at levels below full target achievement, rather than an all or nothing approach; and as a manufacturing company, the Company is not generally subject to the types of risks that may be present in a corporation involved in financial services, trading, or investment activities. Report of the Compensation and Management Development Committee The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Chase Corporation Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and based on such review and discussion we recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Form 10-K.

Bourque joined the Company on February 2, 2021. Jeffery D. Haigh was promoted to Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary on the same date. (2) Salary includes amounts earned in the fiscal year, whether or not deferred. (3) Amounts under Stock Awards reflect the net grant date fair value of the stock-based incentive awards granted under our equity incentive program in the indicated fiscal year (and for fiscal 2022 also includes the restricted stock portion of our equity retention awards for Michael J. Bourque). For the portion of the award subject to performance-based conditions, the amount is based on the estimated probable outcome of the award as of the grant date. Amounts under Option Awards reflect the grant date fair value of stock options awarded during the fiscal year, including those granted in fiscal 2022 as equity retention awards to Michael J. Bourque. In each case, amounts are reported whether or not the award had vested and was recorded as compensation expense in accordance with the accounting for stock-based compensation guidance during the year. Assumptions made in the valuation are described in more detail in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023. Using the grant date fair value but assuming the maximum performance target under the stock-based incentive plan were met or exceeded, the amounts reported under Stock Awards for 2023 would have been approximately 1,912,000 for Adam P. Chase, 256,000 for Michael J. Bourque, 164,000 for Jeffery D. Haigh. The total compensation column for such officers in 2023 would have correspondingly been increased by approximately 765,000, 102,000 and 66,000 for Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque, and Jeffery D. Haigh, respectively. Based on the financial results for fiscal 2023, the amount between the threshold

Table of Contents 
 and the target performance amount was achieved. The equity incentive program is described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under the heading Principal Elements of our Fiscal 2023 Compensation Program Equity Incentive Plan . (4) These amounts reflect incentive payments made under our annual cash incentive program earned during the applicable fiscal year and paid in November following the respective fiscal year end. The cash incentive program is described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under the heading Principal Elements of our 2023 Compensation Program Cash Incentive Plan . (5) Represents the current year aggregate change in the actuarial present value of accumulated benefits under the qualified defined benefit plan and the supplemental pension plan as described under Other Executive Plans Pension Plans . Amounts for Peter R. Chase under this column are reported as zero under applicable SEC regulations because the aggregate change in actuarial present value of his accumulated benefits was a negative amount (a reduction of 1,389,868). This reflects a distribution of 1,554,708 from the supplemental pension plan during the year, as described in more detail under Other Executive Plans Pension Plans , net of an increase of 164,840 resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions from the prior year. (6) These amounts include all other compensation as described in the following table: Qualified Life Automobile 401(k) and Long-Term Allowance Supplemental Disability or Use of Fiscal Retirement Plan Insurance Company Other Name Year Contributions Premiums Car (a) Total Peter R.

Amounts in the table above under Threshold represent cash amounts payable under the cash incentive plan if 80 of the Adjusted EBITDA-based performance target was achieved, representing a specified percentage of the named executive officers base salaries at the grant date, and share amounts payable under the performance-based equity incentive program if 80 of the EPS-based performance target and 80 of the ROIC-based performance target were achieved. Below those performance levels, no payments would be made under the respective plans or plan components. It is possible that a lower share amount payout could be made if less than 80 of the target is achieved under one but not both EPS-based or ROIC-based performance targets, as occurred in 2023. The maximum payout under either the cash incentive plan or the performance-based equity award program is 200 of the target award. The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors formally approved the equity awards on August 30, 2022. The grant date fair value of the possible equity awards reflects the fair value of our common stock on September 1, 2022, the first day of our fiscal year and the date on which awards were initially granted, multiplied by the total number of shares of restricted stock to be awarded assuming the target was met (assumed to be the probable outcome of the performance conditions at the initial grant date). The awards were paid in accordance with the plans upon finalization of our annual financial results and certification of the awards by the Compensation and Management Development Committee in November 2023. The actual results for fiscal year 2023 reflected achievement between threshold and target for the participating officers in the cash incentive plan. The actual results for fiscal year 2023 for the EPS based element of the performance-based equity award was below threshold and the ROIC-based element of the performance-based equity award was between threshold and target for the participating officers.

The stock option awards noted in the table above with September 2031 expiration dates vest in three equal annual tranches beginning August 31, 2022 through August 31, 2024. The stock option award noted in the table above with a February 2032 expiration date vest January 31, 2025. The stock option awards noted in the table above with September 2032 expiration date vest August 31, 2023 through August 31, 2025. Each such vesting date is subject to continued service requirements. Amounts under the Stock Awards columns reflect restricted stock issued under our equity incentive programs for fiscal 2023 and 2022, and our Chief Financial Officer s equity retention award in the case of fiscal 2022. The columns include the value of the share amounts issued during fiscal 2023 and 2022, even though the final number of shares comprising the 2023 award was not certified until after the fiscal year end and remained subject to increase or decrease as of August 31, 2023. The market value of all restricted stock is based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day in the fiscal year. The closing price as reported by the NYSE American on August 31, 2023 was 126.50.

 For Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque, and Jeffery D. Haigh, stock awards for fiscal 2022 will vest on August 31, 2024. For Adam P. Chase and Jeffery D. Haigh, stock awards for fiscal 2023 will vest on August 31, 2025. For Michael J. Bourque, stock awards for fiscal 2023 will vest on August 31, 2025 or, with respect to his equity retention award only, January 31, 2025. These schedules are outlined in the table below (as of August 31, 2023):

Haigh 416 1,114 As noted above, subsequent to August 31, 2023, 7553, 1010, and 647 stock awards from the original performance grants were forfeited by Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque, and Jeffery D. Haigh, respectively, under our equity incentive program for fiscal 2023 under the financial performance measures applicable to that plan. Because the amounts were determined after August 31, 2023, based on our fiscal year performance, these forfeitures are not reflected in the tables above. See the discussion under Principal Elements of our 2023 Compensation Program Equity Incentive Plan in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis above. Option Exercises and Stock Vested for 2023 The following table sets forth information relating to options exercised by each of our named executive officers in the year ended August 31, 2023. The value realized on exercise of options represents the difference between the fair market value of the shares acquired on exercise, as determined by the closing price per share of our common stock on the exercise date, and the exercise price of the stock option. As a result, the value realized on exercise does not make any adjustment for those shares forfeited to us by the option holder to pay the exercise price or the amount of withholding tax due from the option holder upon exercise, pursuant to the exercise provisions of the plan under which the stock options were granted. The following table also sets forth information relating to stock vesting during fiscal 2023, which includes for Adam P. Chase and Jeffery D. Haigh the equity incentive awards granted on September 1, 2020 and Michael J. Bourque the inventive awards granted on February 2, 2021.

 For our Chief Financial Officer, if within 12 months immediately following a change in control, the officer s employment is terminated by the Company without cause or the officer terminates his employment with the Company for good reason, the officer shall be entitled to severance benefits as outlined below. In the case of any of the above triggering events, the named executive officer will receive the following benefits: Severance pay in an amount equal to a multiple (2.0x in the case of Peter R. Chase and Adam P. Chase and 1.0x in the case of Michael J. Bourque and Jeffery D. Haigh) of the greater of the named executive s annual salary in effect prior to the change in control or his annual salary in effect immediately prior to termination. For these purposes, the named executive officer s salary will include bonuses, calculated by taking the average of the prior two years annual bonuses. Continued participation in benefits in effect for the named executive as of the date of termination, subject to the terms and conditions of the respective plans and applicable law, for a period of one year following the termination date, or two years in the case of Adam P. Chase. The named executive shall be entitled to his salary through the period ending with the date of such termination and any accrued benefits if terminated for cause. In case of death, disability or retirement, the named executive shall be entitled to such benefits as may be provided to him pursuant to the Company s employee benefit plans. Restricted Stock and Option Awards. Under the terms of the applicable restricted stock awards, in the event of a termination without cause, unvested restricted stock awards will vest on a prorated basis through the date of termination. In the event of a change in control as defined in the applicable award, unvested shares of restricted stock will automatically vest, and the vesting of outstanding but unvested stock options may be accelerated, at the discretion of the Board of Directors. For purposes of the table below, we have assumed the accelerated vesting of stock options upon the occurrence of a change in control.

The Company maintains a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan Pension Plan for Employees of Chase Corporation and a non-qualified excess benefit plan Supplemental Pension Plan ). The qualified pension plan covers substantially all employees of certain businesses of the Company who have attained the age of 21 and have completed three months of service. The Supplemental Pension Plan covers those employees of the Company who from time to time may be designated by the Board of Directors and who meet other eligibility and salary criteria. Currently, the Company s Executive Chairman and the Company s Chief Executive Officer have been designated by the Board of Directors as being covered by the excess benefit plan. Benefits under the qualified pension plan are determined based on final average base earnings (subject to Code-imposed limits on compensation and excluding bonuses, overtime, and other extraordinary amounts) and total years of service with the Company (up to a maximum of 40 years). Benefits under the Supplemental Pension Plan are determined based on final average earnings (including base salary and incentive-based bonuses and without regard to Code-imposed limits on compensation) and total years of service with the Company. A participant becomes fully vested in the Supplemental Pension Plan benefits upon completion of five years of service with the Company. Benefits are payable upon the participant s separation from service with the Company, including the participant s retirement or death. Benefits under the Supplemental Pension Plan are paid out on a monthly basis over a period of ten years.

 Chief Executive Officer Pay Ratio As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the total annual compensation of our median compensated employee and the total annual compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, Adam P. Chase. For fiscal 2023, we identified our median compensated employee as of August 31, 2023, out of our total global employee population of 859 employees at the time, using a Consistently Applied Compensation Measure CACM of gross payroll earnings for the year-to-date period ending on such date. Gross payroll earnings consist of all compensation elements appearing in payroll records for each individual, which primarily includes base salary or wages, overtime, bonuses, and other pay components. For purposes of determining the median employee, the pay of those permanent employees that were hired or joined the Company after September 1, 2022 through August 31, 2023 was adjusted to reflect the full period s gross payroll earnings. Where applicable, gross payroll earnings were converted to U.S. dollars using the average foreign exchange rates from September 1, 2022 through August 31, 2023. Under applicable SEC rules, we are required to identify our median employee at least once every three years. Due to the acquisition of NuCera Solutions, the Company identified a new median employee for fiscal 2023. For our fiscal year ended August 31, 2023, our median employee identified as described above had total compensation, determined in accordance with applicable SEC rules, of 49,404. As reported in the Summary Compensation Table, the 2023 annual total compensation for our Chief Executive Officer, Adam P. Chase, was 2,444,144 resulting in a pay ratio of 49:1. This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.
