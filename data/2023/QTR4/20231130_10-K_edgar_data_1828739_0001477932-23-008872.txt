MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 4 | Page Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATION As of September 30, 2023, we had deficit of 74,505. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. Year ended September 30, 2023 compared to year ended September 30, 2022 Revenue During year ended September 30, 2023, the Company generated 7,982 in revenue compared to -0- in revenue during year ended September 30, 2022. Operating Expenses During the year ended September 30, 2023, we incurred general and administrative expenses of 24,759 and cost of goods sold of 6,525 compared to 32,466 for the year ended September 30, 2022. General and administrative and professional fee expenses incurred generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, such as legal and accounting. Net Loss Our net loss for the year ended September 30, 2023 was 23,302 compared to 32,466 for the year ended September 30, 2022. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As at September 30, 2023 our total assets were 2,499 compared to 5,676 in total assets at September 30, 2022. As at September 30, 2023, our current liabilities were 45,859 compared to 25,734 as of September 30, 2022. Stockholders deficit was 43,360 as of September 30, 2023 compared to stockholders equity of 20,058 as of September 30, 2022. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows used in operating activities was 33,236, consisting of net loss of 23,302, amortization expenses of 66 and decrease in accounts payable of 10,000.

Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. MATERIAL COMMITMENTS As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments. PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Azzurro Solutions Corp. as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, cash flows, and the related notes (collectively referred to as financial statements for the periods then ended. In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note #2 to the financial statements, although the Company has limited operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note #2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. /S/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

F-5 Table of Contents AZZURRO SOLUTIONS CORP. NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (OCTOBER 4, 2019) TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 . These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms.

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year September 30, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
