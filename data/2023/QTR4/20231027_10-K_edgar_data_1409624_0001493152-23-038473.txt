CAUTIONARY
NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The
information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes some statements that are not purely historical and that are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and as such, may involve risks and uncertainties.
These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, perceived
opportunities in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts
or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. You
can generally identify forward-looking statements as statements containing the words anticipates, believes, continue, could, estimates,
expects, intends, may, might, plans, possible, potential, predicts, projects, seeks, should, will, would and similar expressions,
or the negatives of such terms, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 

Forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the
forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on various assumptions, many of which are based,
in turn, upon further assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and forward-looking statements are expressed in good faith based on management s
views and assumptions as of the time the statements were made, but there can be no assurance that management s expectations, beliefs,
or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished. 

In
addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere herein, the following are important factors that, in our view, could cause
actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements: technological advances, impact of competition,
dependence on key personnel and the need to attract new management, effectiveness of cost and marketing efforts, acceptances of products,
ability to expand markets and the availability of capital or other funding on terms satisfactory to us. We disclaim any obligation to
update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof. 

As
used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Annual Report ), the terms Himalaya, the Company, 
 we, us and our refer to Himalaya Technologies, Inc.

PART
I 

Item
1. Description of Business. 

Himalaya
Technologies, Inc. a/k/a Homeland Resources Ltd. Himalaya , HMLA, us, we, the
 Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 8, 2003. The Company s principal historical
activities had been the acquisition of a mineral property in the State of New Mexico. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2010, the
Company began to acquire working interests in a seismic exploration program as well as a drilling program in crude oil and natural gas
properties in Oklahoma. Prior to July 31, 2019 the Company discontinued the exploration and drilling in Oklahoma and New Mexico. The
Company has leases on two properties that were fully depleted prior to July 31, 2019. Over the past few years, the company generated
approximately 1,500 per year of net revenue from these leases. Subsequent to July 31, 2022 the Company reached an agreement with the
prior CEO to distribute the oil leases in payment of loan from shareholder. Our intended plan of operations was to develop and enhance
our social site Kanab.Club targeting health and wellness in the cannabis media market. 

At
July 31, 2023, the Company had one wholly owned subsidiary, KANAB CORP. The Company had one investment, Peer to Peer Network, Inc. (PTOP.) 

KANAB
CORP. is a development stage company targeting information services for the cannabis industry using its social site Kanab.Club (https://kanab.club/).
We do not offer e-commerce services at this time or touch the cannabis plant and, given these matters, do not believe regulatory oversight
or rules of law are a risk factor to our business. 

On
November 28, 2021 we executed a 19.9 stock purchase with GenBio, Inc. GenBio https://www.genbioinc.com/) a provider
of nutraceutical products and services based on proprietary biotechnology that fight inflammation and high blood pressure. We issued
99,686 series B Preferred shares of stock for 2,036,188 common shares of GenBio, Inc., representing 19.9 ownership. Based on a stock
price at closing of .0019 and 99,685,794 common stock equivalents, this valued the investment at 189,749. On May 16, 2023, we unwound
our investment in GenBio, and subsequently received back 99,686 series B Preferred shares of stock. 

On
January 1, 2022, the Company executed a 19.9 stock purchase with The Agrarian Group LLC TAG http://www.theagrariangroup.com/),
a provider of digital intelligence AgtechDi software designed from its granted patents to optimize the food supply chain
by increasing food safety and profitability for growers who operate vertical farms, greenhouses, converted shipping containers, and other
forms of controlled environment agriculture. TAG is focusing its technology on the broad produce market, but in the future may offer
it to cannabis cultivators. TAG is a software platform and will never touch the cannabis plant, eliminating regulatory risk, in our view.
Under the Investment Agreement, we issued TAG 99,686 Series B Preferred shares in exchange for 1,242,000 Class A Membership units of
TAG. Based on a stock price at closing of .0012 and 99,868,000 common stock equivalents, this values the investment at 119,841. On April
3, 2023, we unwound our investment in TAG, and received back 99,686 series B Preferred shares of stock. 

 . 

 On
June 12, 2023, we purchased 210,000,000 common shares of Peer-to-Peer Network (OTC: PTOP) from FOMO WORLDWIDE, INC. (OTC: FOMC)
by issuing FOMO WORLDWIDE, INC. 1,680,000 of our Series A Preferred shares. The fair value of the PTOP shares received was 63,000, and
the as if converted value of our Series A Preferred shares was 100,800. A loss of 37,800 was thus recorded on acquisition. At July
31, 2023, the value of the investment in PTOP was 21,000. 

Our
business plan included completing our social site Kanab.Club targeting health and wellness focused on the cannabis market, generating
revenues from advertising and subscriptions, incorporating social media site into the site, and marketing our planned social sites including
Goccha.net and Yinzworldwide.com.

The
Company s shareholder voting control is effectively controlled by its chairman and CEO, Vikram P. Grover, due to his ownership
of (i) all 1,000,000 of the outstanding shares of the Company s Series C Preferred Stock which has voting power of 100,000 votes
per share, (ii) 4,777,777 shares of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock directly (31.9 of that class s outstanding shares)
and 2,000,000 shares of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock indirectly through a Company he controls (27.4 which have 50 votes
per share. and (iii) 247,094 shares of the Company s Series B Preferred Stock directly (31.9 of that class s outstanding
shares) and 250,000 shares of the Company s Series B Preferred Stock indirectly through a Company he controls (27.4 which have
1,000 votes per share. With this voting power, Mr. Grover can determine the outcome of any matter put to a shareholder vote including
taking corporate actions by shareholder consent.

Market
Information 

Our
shares of common stock are quoted on the OTCPink tier of the over-the-counter market operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol
 HMLA . Such market is extremely limited. We can provide no assurance that our shares of common stock will be continued to
be traded on the OTCPink or another exchange, or if traded, that the current public market will be sustainable. 

Holders
of Record 

As
of the date of this Annual Report, there were approximately 34 holders of record of our common stock, as reported by the Company s
transfer agent. In computing the number of holders of record, each broker-dealer and clearing corporation holding shares on behalf of
its customers is counted as a single shareholder and accordingly, the Company believes that the number of beneficial owners of its common
stock is significantly higher. 

Dividends 

We
have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, nor do we anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future. Furthermore,
we expect to retain any future earnings to finance our operations and expansion. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be
at the discretion of our Board of Directors.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 

 Himalaya Technologies, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Himalaya
Technologies, Inc. (the Company) as of July 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders 
deficit, and cash flows for each of the two years ended July 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of year ended July 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years ended
July 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company had operating losses for
each of the years ended July 31, 2023, and July 31, 2022, has an accumulated deficit as of July 31, 2023, and the Company has not completed
its efforts to generate revenues to cover its operating costs. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as
a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit
of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

F- 2 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period
audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee or the Company s
governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We have determined there are critical matters related to the Company s convertible
debentures. 

As described in Notes 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
and Note 7, Convertible Note Payables, to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had convertible debentures with attached
warrants that required accounting considerations and significant estimates. The Company determined that variable conversion features with
attached warrants issued in connection with certain convertible debentures required derivative liability classification. These variable
conversion features were initially measured at fair value and subsequently have been remeasured to fair value at each reporting period.
The Company determined the fair value of the embedded derivatives using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The value of the
embedded derivative liabilities related to the convertible debentures as of July 31, 2023 was 680,946. We identified the accounting considerations
and related valuations, including the related fair value determinations of the embedded derivative liabilities of such as a critical audit
matter. The principal considerations for our determination were: (1) the accounting consideration in determining the nature of the various
features (2) the evaluation of the potential derivatives and potential bifurcation in the instruments, and (3) considerations related
to the determination of the fair value of the various debt and equity instruments and the conversion features that include valuation models
and assumptions utilized by management. An audit of these elements is especially challenging and requires auditor judgement due to the
nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill or knowledge needed. Our
audit procedures related to management s conclusion on the evaluation and related valuation of embedded derivatives, included the
following, among others: (1) evaluating the relevant terms and conditions of the various financings, (2) assessing the appropriateness
of conclusions reached by the Company with respect to the accounting for the convertible debt, and the assessment and accounting for potential
derivatives and (3) independently recomputing the valuations determined by Management. 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had not taken any significant uncertain tax positions on its tax returns for the period ended July
31, 2023 and prior years or in computing its tax provisions for any years. Prior management considered its tax positions and believed
that all of the positions taken by the Company in its Federal and State tax returns were more likely than not to be sustained upon examination.
The Company is subject to examination by U.S. Federal and State tax authorities from inception to present, generally for three years
after they are filed. New management, which took control of the Company on June 21, 2021, is currently evaluating prior management s
decision to not file federal tax returns and plans on filing past returns and related 1099 filings for compensation paid to prior management,
employees, consultants, contractors and affiliates. The Company does not believe it has a material tax liability due to its operating
losses in these periods but is preparing tax filings to bring itself current as it completes and moves forward on announced mergers and
acquisitions.

the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, it is reasonably possible that the estimate of discounted future net cash flows from
proved crude oil and natural gas reserves could change in the near term. If crude oil and natural gas prices decline in the future, even
if only for a short period of time, it is possible that additional impairments of crude oil and natural gas properties could occur. In
addition, it is reasonably possible that additional impairments could occur if costs are incurred in excess of any increases in the present
value of future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves, or if properties are sold for proceeds less than the discounted
present value of the related proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. 

The

To the extent that we are required to raise additional funds to acquire properties, and to cover costs of operations, we intend to do
so through additional offerings of debt or equity securities. There are no commitments or arrangements for other offerings in place,

The
Company estimates the fair value of each award on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions
noted in the table below. Since Black-Scholes option valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs, those ranges are
disclosed. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock. The Company uses historical data
to estimate award exercise and employee termination within the valuation model, whereby separate groups of employees that have similar
historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of granted awards is derived from the
output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that granted awards are expected to be outstanding; the range
given below results from certain groups of employees exhibiting different behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual
life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed with an objective
of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, to allow
timely consideration regarding required disclosures. 

The
evaluation of our disclosure controls by our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive, financial and accounting officer) included
a review of the controls objectives and design, the operation of the controls, and the effect of the controls on the information
presented in this Annual Report. Our management, including our chief executive officer, does not expect that disclosure controls can
or will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud, if any. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Also, projections of any evaluation of the disclosure
controls and procedures to future periods are subject to the risk that the disclosure controls and procedures may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive, financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the
end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have
concluded that there were material weaknesses in our internal controls over Financial reporting as of July 31, 2023 and they were therefore
not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms. The material weaknesses in our controls and procedure were a lack adequate staffing and supervision within the accounting
operations of our Company. Management does not believe that any of these weaknesses materially affected the results and accuracy of its
financial statements. However, in view of this discovery of such weaknesses, management has begun a review to improve them. 

MANAGEMENT S
ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING . 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company in accordance as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the (i) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (ii) reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and (iii) compliance with applicable
laws and regulations. Our internal controls framework is based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management s
assessment of the effectiveness of the small business issuer s internal control over financial reporting is as of the year ended
July 31, 2023. We believe that internal controls over financial reporting as set forth above shows some weaknesses and are not effective.
We have identified certain weaknesses considering the nature and extent of our current operations and any risks or errors in financial
reporting under current operations. 

Under
applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, as a smaller reporting company this Annual Report does not
include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
