PART I 
 
 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 On one or more occasions, we may make statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding our assumptions, projections, expectations, targets, intentions or beliefs about future events. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included or incorporated by reference herein relating to management s current expectations of future financial performance, continued growth and changes in economic conditions or capital markets are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 Words or phrases such as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, intends, plans, predicts, projects, targets, will likely result, hopes, will continue or similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed. We caution that while we make such statements in good faith and we believe such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, including without limitation, management s examination of historical operating trends, data contained in records and other data available from third parties, we cannot assure you that our projections will be achieved. Factors that may cause such differences include: economic conditions generally and in each of the markets in which we are located, the amount of sales contributed by new and existing restaurants, labor costs for our personnel, fluctuations in the cost of food products, adverse weather conditions, changes in consumer preferences and the level of competition from existing or new competitors. We have attempted to identify, in context, certain factors that we believe may cause actual future experience and results to differ materially from our current expectation regarding the relevant matter or subject area. 
 While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this report in the context of the factors that could cause outcomes to differ materially from our expectations. These factors include, but are not limited to: 
 the adverse impact of current and future economic conditions, including inflation, on our (i) operating results and financial condition, (ii) ability to comply with the terms and covenants of our debt agreements, and (iii) ability to pay or refinance our existing debt or to obtain additional financing; 
 the adverse impact of the current political climate on our (i) operating results and financial condition, (ii) ability to comply with the terms and covenants of our debt agreements, and (iii) ability to pay or refinance our existing debt or to obtain additional financing; 
 increases in food, beverage and supply costs, especially for seafood, shellfish, chicken and beef; 
 increases in wages and benefit costs, including the cost of group medical insurance; 
 our ability to open new restaurants in new and existing markets, including difficulty in finding sites and in negotiating acceptable leases; 
 our ability to identify appropriate acquisition candidates and complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms; 
 vulnerability to changes in consumer preferences and economic conditions; 
 vulnerability to conditions in the cities in which we operate; 
 vulnerability to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters given the geographic concentration and real estate intensive nature of our business; 
 our ability to extend existing leases on favorable terms, if at all: 
 negative publicity, whether or not valid, and our ability to respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media; 
 risks associated with food safety and quality and food-borne illnesses; 
 the reliance of the Company on the continued service of its executive officers; 
 3 

the impact of any security breaches of confidential customer information in connection with our electronic process of credit and debit card transactions; and 
 the impact of any failure of our information technology system or any breach of our network security. 
 
 We caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences we anticipate or affect us or our operations in the ways that we expect. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 
 
 From time to time, oral or written forward-looking statements are also included in our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, our Schedule 14A, our press releases and other materials released to the public. Although we believe that at the time made, the expectations reflected in all of these forward-looking statements are and will be reasonable; any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our reports on Forms 10-Q, and 8-K, our Schedule 14A and any other public statements that are made by us may prove to be incorrect. This may occur as a result of inaccurate assumptions or as a consequence of known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, certain of which are beyond our control, will be important in determining our future performance. Consequently, actual results may differ materially from those that might be anticipated from forward-looking statements. In light of these and other uncertainties, you should not regard the inclusion of a forward-looking statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or other public communications that we might make as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved, and you should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. 
 We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, your attention is directed to any further disclosures made on related subjects in our subsequent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms 10-Q and 8-K and Schedule 14A. 
 Unless the context requires otherwise, references to we, us, our, ARKR and the Company refer specifically to Ark Restaurants Corp. and its subsidiaries, partnerships, variable interest entities and predecessor entities.

Item 1. Business 
 Overview 
 We are a New York corporation formed in 1983. As of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we owned and/or operated 17 restaurants and bars, 16 fast food concepts and catering operations through our subsidiaries. Four of our restaurant and bar facilities are located in New York City, one is located in Washington, D.C., five are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, one is located in Atlantic City, New Jersey, four are located on the east coast of Florida and two are located on the Gulf Coast of Alabama. 
 Our restaurants are typically larger, destination properties intended to benefit from high patron traffic attributable to the uniqueness of the location and catered events. All of our expansion in recent years has been through acquisitions as follows: The Rustic Inn in Dania Beach, Florida (2014); Shuckers in Jensen Beach, Florida (2016); two Original Oyster Houses , one in Gulf Shores, Alabama and one in Spanish Fort, Alabama (2017), JB's on the Beach in Deerfield Beach, Florida (2019), and Blue Moon Fish Company (2021) in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida. 
 The names and themes of each of our restaurants are different except for our two Broadway Burger Bar and Grill restaurants and two Original Oyster House restaurants. The menus in our restaurants are extensive, offering a wide variety of high-quality foods at generally moderate prices. The atmosphere at many of the restaurants is lively and extremely casual. Most of the restaurants have separate bar areas, are open seven days a week and most serve lunch as well as dinner. A majority of our net sales are derived from dinner as opposed to lunch service. 
 While decor differs from restaurant to restaurant, interiors are marked by distinctive architectural and design elements which often incorporate dramatic interior open spaces and extensive glass exteriors. The wall treatments, lighting and decorations are typically vivid, unusual and, in some cases, highly theatrical.

Leases 
 We are not currently committed to any significant development projects, except for the refresh obligations in connection with the New York-New York Hotel and Casino lease renewals discussed below; however, we may take advantage of opportunities we consider to be favorable, when they occur, depending upon the availability of financing and other factors. 
 Restaurant Expansion and Other Developments 
 On April 8, 2022, the Company extended its lease for Gallagher's Steakhouse at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2032. In connection with the extension, the Company agreed to spend a minimum of 1,500,000 to materially refresh the premises by April 30, 2023 (as extended from September 30, 2022 due to supply chain issues). Accordingly, the property was substantially closed for renovation on February 5, 2023 and reopened on April 28, 2023. The total cost of the refresh was approximately 1,900,000. 
 
 On June 24, 2022, the Company extended its lease for America at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2033. In connection with the extension, the Company has agreed to spend a minimum of 4,000,000 to materially refresh the premises by December 31, 2024, subject to various extensions as set out in the agreement. No amounts have been expended to date related to this refresh. 
 
 On July 21, 2022, the Company extended its lease for the Village Eateries at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2034. As part of this extension, the Broadway Burger Bar and Grill and Gonzalez y Gonzalez , were carved out of the Village Eateries footprint and the extended date for those two locations is December 31, 2033. In connection with the extension, the Company has agreed to spend a minimum of 3,500,000 to materially refresh all three of these premises by March 31, 2024 (as extended from June 30, 2023), subject to various extensions as set out in the agreement. To date approximately 300,000 has been spent on this refresh. 
 
 Each of the above refresh obligations are to be consistent with designs approved by the landlord which shall not be unreasonably withheld. We have and will continue to pay all rent as required by the leases without abatement during construction. Note that our substantial completion of work set forth in plans approved by the landlord shall constitute our compliance with the requirements of the completion deadlines, regardless of whether or not the amount actually expended in connection therewith is less than the minimum. 
 The opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial pre-opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of personnel, excess kitchen costs, costs of supervision and other expenses during the pre-opening period and during a post-opening shake out period until operations can be considered to be functioning normally. The amount of such pre-opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened. 
 Our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year, which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry. To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons, we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants. There can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened, particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us, thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity. 
 We may take advantage of other opportunities we consider to be favorable, when they occur, depending upon the availability of financing and other factors. 
 Recent Restaurant Dispositions 
 On July 5, 2022, the Company terminated its lease for Lucky 7 at the Foxwoods Resort Casino. The closure did not result in a material change to the Company's operations. 
 Investment in New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC 
 On March 12, 2013, the Company made a 4,200,000 investment in the New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC NMR through its purchase of a membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, an existing member of NMR with a then 63.7 ownership interest. On November 19, 2013, the Company invested an additional 464,000 in NMR through a purchase of an additional membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC resulting in a total ownership of 11.6 of Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, and an effective ownership interest in NMR of 7.4 , subject to dilution. In 2015, the Company invested an additional 222,000 in NMR and on February 7, 2017, the Company invested an additional 222,000 in NMR, both as a result of capital calls, bringing 
 8 

its total investment to 5,108,000 with no change in ownership. The Company accounts for this investment at cost, less impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-01. There are no observable prices for this investment. 
 During the years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, the Company received distributions from NMR in the amounts of 52,000 and 421,000, respectively, which are included in other income in the consolidated statement of operations for the years then ended. 
 In addition to the Company s ownership interest in NMR, if casino gaming is approved at the Meadowlands and NMR is granted the right to conduct said gaming, the Company shall be granted the exclusive right to operate the food and beverage concessions in the gaming facility with the exception of one restaurant. 
 In conjunction with this investment, the Company, through a 97 owned subsidiary, Ark Meadowlands LLC AM VIE ), also entered into a long-term agreement with NMR for the exclusive right to operate food and beverage concessions serving the new raceway facilities (the Racing F B Concessions located in the new raceway grandstand constructed at the Meadowlands Racetrack in northern New Jersey. Under the agreement, NMR is responsible to pay for the costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the Racing F B Concessions, and all revenues and profits thereof inure to the benefit of NMR. AM VIE receives an annual fee equal to 5 of the net profits received by NMR from the Racing F B Concessions during each calendar year. AM VIE is a variable interest entity; however, based on qualitative consideration of the contracts with AM VIE, the operating structure of AM VIE, the Company s role with AM VIE, and that the Company is not obligated to absorb expected losses of AM VIE, the Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary and not required to consolidate the operations of AM VIE. 
 The Company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with AM VIE is limited to a receivable from AM VIE s primary beneficiary (NMR, a related party). As of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, 11,000 and 22,000 were due AM VIE by NMR. 
 On April 25, 2014, the Company loaned 1,500,000 to Meadowlands Newmark, LLC. The note bears interest at 3 , compounded monthly and added to the principal, and is due in its entirety on January 31, 2024. The note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty or premium. The principal and accrued interest related to this note in the amounts of 1,399,000 and 1,357,000, are included in Investment In and Receivable From New Meadowlands Racetrack in the consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively. On April 30, 2023, the due date of the note was extended to June 30, 2029. 
 Restaurant Management 
 Each restaurant is managed by its own manager and has its own chef. Food products and other supplies are purchased primarily from various unaffiliated suppliers, in most cases by our headquarters' personnel. Each of our restaurants has two or more assistant managers and sous chefs (assistant chefs). Financial and management control is maintained at the corporate level through the use of automated systems that include centralized accounting and reporting. 
 Purchasing and Distribution 
 We strive to obtain quality menu ingredients, raw materials and other supplies and services for our operations from reliable sources at competitive prices. Substantially all menu items are prepared on each restaurant s premises daily from scratch, using fresh ingredients. Each restaurant s management determines the quantities of food and supplies required and then orders the items from local, regional and national suppliers on terms negotiated by our centralized purchasing staff. Restaurant-level inventories are maintained at a minimum dollar-value level in relation to sales due to the relatively rapid turnover of the perishable produce, poultry, meat, fish and dairy commodities that are used in operations. 
 We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term supply agreements depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we do not contract for long periods of time for our fresh commodities such as produce, poultry, meat, fish and dairy items and, consequently, such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations. Independent food service distributors deliver most food and supply items daily to restaurants. The financial impact of the termination of any such supply agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position. We believe that we have established stable long-term relationships with several key suppliers, particularly with respect to crabs and other shellfish. 

9 

Competition 
 The hospitality industry is highly competitive and is often affected by changes in taste and entertainment trends among the public, by local, national and economic conditions affecting spending habits, and by population and traffic patterns. We believe that the principal means of competition among restaurants include the location, type and quality of facilities and the type, quality and price of beverage and food served. 
 Our restaurants compete directly or indirectly with many well-established competitors, both nationally and locally owned, some with substantially greater financial resources than we have. Their resources and market presence may provide advantages in marketing, purchasing and negotiating leases. We compete with other restaurant and retail establishments for sites and finding management personnel. 
 Employees 
 At December 8, 2023, we employed 1,993 persons (including employees at managed facilities), 1,401 of whom were full-time employees, and 592 of whom were part-time employees; 39 of whom were headquarters personnel, 201 of whom were restaurant management personnel, 754 of whom were kitchen personnel and 999 of whom were restaurant service personnel. A number of our restaurant service personnel are employed on a part-time basis. Changes in minimum wage levels may adversely affect our labor costs and the restaurant industry generally because a large percentage of restaurant personnel are paid at or slightly above the minimum wage. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements. 
 We have experienced aggressive competition for talent, wage inflation and pressure to improve workplace conditions and benefits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and various other economic factors. Our compensation packages may prove insufficient to attract and retain the best personnel in light of the challenges posed by the pandemic and wage pressures resulting from the labor shortage. Higher employee turnover levels or our failure to recruit and retain new restaurant employees in a timely manner could impact our ability to grow sales at existing restaurants or open new restaurants and result in higher than projected labor costs. 
 Government Regulation 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. Each restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities that may include alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, environmental, zoning and public safety agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties in obtaining or failures to obtain the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development and openings of new restaurants, or could disrupt the operations of existing restaurants. 
 Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities for licenses and permits to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be subject to penalties, temporary suspension or revocation for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations impact many aspects of the daily operations of our restaurants, including the minimum ages of patrons and employees consuming or serving such beverages; employee alcoholic beverages training and certification requirements; hours of operation; advertising; wholesale purchasing and inventory control of such beverages; seating of minors and the service of food within our bar areas; and the storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. State and local authorities in many jurisdictions routinely monitor compliance with alcoholic beverage laws. The failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining, a liquor license for a particular restaurant could adversely affect our ability to obtain such licenses in jurisdictions where the failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining, a liquor license occurred. 
 We are subject to dram-shop statutes in most of the states in which we have operations, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance. A settlement or judgment against us under a dram-shop statute in excess of liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 Various federal and state labor laws govern our operations and our relationship with employees, including such matters as minimum wages, breaks, overtime, fringe benefits, safety, working conditions and citizenship requirements. We are also subject to the regulations of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. If our employees do not meet federal citizenship or residency requirements, their deportation could lead to a disruption in our work force. Significant government-imposed increases in minimum wages, paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits, or increased tax reporting, assessment or payment requirements related to employees who receive gratuities could be detrimental to our profitability.

Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 ADA and related state statutes. The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to public accommodations and employment. Under the ADA and related state laws, when constructing new restaurants or undertaking significant remodeling of existing restaurants, we must make them more readily accessible to disabled persons. 
 
 We are subject to federal and state environmental regulations, but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations. During fiscal 2023, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated. 
 Seasonal Nature of Business 
 Our business is highly seasonal; however, our broader geographical reach as a result of recent acquisitions is expected to continue to mitigate some of the risk. For instance, the second quarter of our fiscal year, consisting of the non-holiday portion of the cold weather season in New York and Washington (January, February and March), is the poorest performing quarter; however, in recent years this has been partially offset by our locations in Florida as they experience increased results in the winter months. We achieve our best results during the warm weather, attributable to our extensive outdoor dining availability, particularly at Bryant Park in New York and Sequoia in Washington, D.C. (our largest restaurants) and our outdoor cafes. However, even during summer months these facilities can be adversely affected by unusually cool or rainy weather conditions. Our facilities in Las Vegas are indoor and generally operate on a more consistent basis throughout the year.

 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we are a party to various lawsuits arising from accidents at our restaurants and workers compensation claims, which are generally handled by our insurance carriers. 
 Our employment of management personnel, waiters, waitresses and kitchen staff at a number of different restaurants has resulted in the institution, from time to time, of litigation alleging violation by us of employment discrimination laws. We do not believe that any of such suits will have a material adverse effect upon us, our financial condition or operations. 
 Except as otherwise provided below, the Company is not subject to pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary claims incidental to its business, which the Company does not believe will materially impact results of operations. 
 On May 1, 2018, two former tipped service workers (the Plaintiffs ), individually and on behalf of all other similarly situated personnel, filed a putative class action lawsuit (the Complaint against the Company and certain subsidiaries as well as certain officers of the Company (the Defendants ). Plaintiffs alleged, on behalf of themselves and the putative class, that the Company violated certain of the New York State Labor Laws and related regulations. In December 2020, the parties reached a settlement agreement resolving all issues alleged in the Complaint, which received final approval by the New York State Supreme Court in October 2022, for approximately 600,000, which was previously accrued on the October 1, 2022 consolidated balance sheet. Under the terms of the court approved settlement agreement, settlement proceeds were distributed to the Plaintiffs in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

 Prior to fiscal 2022, the Company had options outstanding under two stock option plans: the 2010 Stock Option Plan (the 2010 Plan and the 2016 Stock Option Plan (the 2016 Plan ). Options granted under both plans are exercisable at prices at least equal to the fair market value of such stock on the dates the options were granted and expire ten years after the date of grant. 
 On March 15, 2022, the shareholders of the Company approved the Ark Restaurants Corp. 2022 Stock Option Plan (the "2022 Plan"). Effective with this approval, the Company terminated the 2016 Plan along with the 63,750 authorized but unissued options under the 2016 Plan. Such termination did not affect any of the options previously issued and outstanding under the 2016 Plan, which remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. Under the 2022 Plan, 500,000 options were authorized for future grant and are exercisable at prices at least equal to the fair market value of such stock on the dates the options were granted. The options expire ten years after the date of grant. 
 During the year ended September 30, 2023, no options to purchase shares of common stock were issued by the Company.

 Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Disclosure 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this annual report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in this annual report. Please see the discussion of forward-looking statements at the beginning of this annual report under "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements". 
 COVID-19 Pandemic 
 Recent global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic ("COVID-19"), have adversely affected global economies, disrupted global supply chains and labor force participation and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. As a result, we experienced significant and variable disruptions to our business as federal, state and local restrictions were mandated, among other remedial measures, to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. While restrictions on the type of permitted operating model and occupancy capacity may continue to change, during fiscal 2022 all of our restaurants operated with no restrictions, other than in New York City where customers were required to show proof of vaccination through November 1, 2022. 
 In addition to the associated impacts of COVID-19, our operating results have been impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic factors, leading to increased commodity and wage inflation and other increased costs. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 and its variants, along with other geopolitical and macroeconomic events, could lead to further government mandates, including but not limited to capacity restrictions, shifts in consumer behavior, wage inflation, staffing challenges, product and services cost inflation and disruptions in our supply chain. If these factors significantly impact our cash flow in the future, we may again implement mitigation actions such as suspending dividends, increasing borrowings or modifying our operating strategies. Some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our business, including possible impairments of assets. 
 Overview 
 As of September 30, 2023, the Company owned and operated 17 restaurants and bars, 16 fast food concepts and catering operations, exclusively in the United States, that have similar economic characteristics, nature of products and service, class of customer and distribution methods. The Company believes it meets the criteria for aggregating its operating segments into a single reporting segment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. 
 Accounting Period 
 Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest September 30. We report fiscal years under a 52/53-week format. This reporting method is used by many companies in the hospitality industry and is meant to improve year-to-year comparisons of operating results. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 both included 52 weeks. 
 Seasonality 
 The Company has substantial fixed costs that do not decline proportionally with sales. Although our business is highly seasonal, our broader geographical reach as a result of recent acquisitions is expected to continue to mitigate some of the risk. For instance, the second quarter of our fiscal year, consisting of the non-holiday portion of the cold weather season in New York and 
 15 

Washington (January, February and March), is the poorest performing quarter; however, in recent years this has been partially offset by our locations in Florida as they experience increased results in the winter months. We generally achieve our best results during the warm weather, attributable to our extensive outdoor dining availability, particularly at Bryant Park in New York and Sequoia in Washington, D.C. (our largest restaurants) and our outdoor cafes. However, even during summer months these facilities can be adversely affected by unusually cool or rainy weather conditions. Our facilities in Las Vegas are indoor and generally operate on a more consistent basis throughout the year. 
 Results of Operations 
 The Company s operating loss for the year ended September 30, 2023 (which includes a goodwill impairment charge of 10,000,000) was 4,840,000, down 149.1 as compared to operating income of 9,864,000 for the year ended October 1, 2022. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge of 10,000,000, operating income for the year ended September 30, 2023 decreased 47.7 to 5,160,000 as compared to 9,864,000 for the year ended October 1, 2022. This decrease resulted primarily from increases in labor costs combined with increased base rents and inflationary pressures related to non-commodity items partially offset by an easing in commodity prices. 
 The following table summarizes the significant components of the Company s operating results for the years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively: 
 Year Ended Variance September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 REVENUES: (in thousands) Food and beverage sales 180,820 180,010 810 0.4 Other revenue 3,973 3,664 309 8.4 Total revenues 184,793 183,674 1,119 0.6 COSTS AND EXPENSES: Food and beverage cost of sales 49,624 52,573 (2,949) -5.6 Payroll expenses 66,322 60,000 6,322 10.5 Occupancy expenses 23,472 22,181 1,291 5.8 Other operating costs and expenses 23,498 21,823 1,675 7.7 General and administrative expenses 12,407 12,936 (529) -4.1 Goodwill impairment 10,000 10,000 N/A Depreciation and amortization 4,310 4,297 13 0.3 Total costs and expenses 189,633 173,810 15,823 9.1 OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) (4,840) 9,864 (14,704) -149.1 

Revenues 
 During the year ended September 30, 2023, revenues increased 0.6 as compared to revenues for the year ended October 1, 2022. This small increase was primarily as a result of the changes in same-store sales discussed below. 

16 

Food and Beverage Same-Store Sales 
 On a Company-wide basis, same-store food and beverage sales for the year ended September 30, 2023 were consistent with the year ended October 1, 2022 as follows: 
 Year Ended Variance September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 (in thousands) Las Vegas 55,441 55,364 77 0.1 New York 37,039 33,408 3,631 10.9 Washington, D.C. 10,599 10,611 (12) -0.1 Atlantic City, NJ 2,999 3,555 (556) -15.6 Alabama 17,175 16,749 426 2.5 Florida 55,122 58,624 (3,502) -6.0 Same-store sales 178,375 178,311 64 Other 2,445 1,699 Food and beverage sales 180,820 180,010 
 _____________________ 
 Entries related to percentages in the table above marked " " indicate percentage less than 1 . 
 Same-store sales in Las Vegas increased marginally primarily as a result of increased customer traffic and targeted menu price increases partially offset by the negative impact of the temporary closure of Gallagher's Steakhouse for renovation from February 5, 2023 to April 27, 2023. Same-store sales in New York increased 10.9 driven primarily by strong revenues from our event business and increased customer traffic. Same-store sales in Washington, DC decreased marginally driven primarily by lower headcounts in the third and fourth quarters partially offset by strong revenues from our event business and targeted menu price increases in the first two quarters. Same-store sales in Atlantic City decreased 15.6 as a result of lower customer traffic at the property where we are located. Same-store sales in Alabama increased 2.5 primarily as a result of increased customer traffic and targeted menu price increases. Same-store sales in Florida decreased 6.0 primarily as a result of lower headcounts as compared to the comparable prior period which benefited from outsized volumes as a result of the population increase in Southeast Florida as a result of the migration of people during the pandemic partially offset by targeted menu price increases. 
 Other food and beverage sales consist of sales related to new restaurants opened or acquired during the applicable period, sales related to properties that were closed Lucky 7 - see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Recent Restaurant Dispositions) and other adjustments and fees. 
 Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our restaurants generally did not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year, which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry. To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons, we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants. There can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened, particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us, thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity. 
 Other Revenues 
 Included in other revenues are purchase service fees which represent commissions earned by a subsidiary of the Company for providing purchasing services to other restaurant groups, as well as merchandise sales, license fees, property management fees and other rentals. The increase in other revenues for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended October 1, 2022 is primarily due to an increase in purchase service fees. 
 17 

Costs and Expenses 
 Costs and expenses for the years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 were as follows (in thousands): 
 Year Ended September 30, 2023 to Total Revenues Year Ended October 1, 2022 to Total Revenues Increase (Decrease) Food and beverage cost of sales 49,624 26.9 52,573 28.6 (2,949) -5.6 Payroll expenses 66,322 35.9 60,000 32.7 6,322 10.5 Occupancy expenses 23,472 12.7 22,181 12.1 1,291 5.8 Other operating costs and expenses 23,498 12.7 21,823 11.9 1,675 7.7 General and administrative expenses 12,407 6.7 12,936 7.0 (529) -4.1 Goodwill impairment 10,000 5.4 10,000 N/A Depreciation and amortization 4,310 2.3 4,297 2.3 13 0.3 Total costs and expenses 189,633 173,810 15,823 
 
 Food and beverage costs as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2023 decreased as compared to last year primarily as a result of a very strong event business in New York City and Washington, D.C., which has higher margins, combined with some easing in commodity prices. 
 
 Payroll expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2023 increased as compared to last year primarily as a result of increased labor costs in connection with record low unemployment and ongoing COVID-related labor challenges combined with merit increases and increasing minimum wages in the states where we operate. 
 
 Occupancy expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2023 increased as compared to last year primarily as a result of increases in base rents and increases in property and liability insurance premiums. 
 
 Other operating costs and expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2023 increased as compared to last year primarily as a result of inflation. 
 
 General and administrative expenses (which relate solely to the corporate office in New York City) for the year ended September 30, 2023 decreased as compared to last year primarily as a result of severance accruals in the prior period partially offset by annual merit increases. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended September 30, 2023 increased slightly as compared to the same period of last year primarily as a result of the timing of additions in the prior period. 
 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 Goodwill is the excess of cost over fair market value of tangible and intangible net assets acquired. Goodwill is not presently amortized but tested for impairment annually or when the facts or circumstances indicate a possible impairment of goodwill as a result of a continual decline in performance or as a result of fundamental changes in a market. 
 In performing its goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred and the Company performed a qualitative and quantitative impairment test to determine if the carrying value of our equity, including goodwill, exceeded its fair value. The fair value of our equity was determined using the income-based approach. In the income approach, we utilized a discounted cash flow analysis, which involved estimating the expected future after-tax cash flows generated and then discounting those cash flows to present value, reflecting the relevant risks associated with the achievement of projected cash flows, the possibility that the Bryant Park Grill Cafe and The Porch at Bryant Park leases may not be renewed beyond their expirations on April 30, 2025 (see Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and the time value of money. This approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted EBITDA margins, and discount rates that reflect the risk inherent in the future cash flows. 
 Based on the impairment analysis, the carrying amount of our equity exceeded its estimated fair value, which indicated an impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded a 
 18 

goodwill impairment charge of 10,000,000, of which 8,000,000 was deductible for tax purposes and resulted in a deferred income tax benefit of 2,300,000. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for uncertain tax positions reflect management s best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income tax in numerous state taxing jurisdictions. Significant judgment and estimates are required in the determination of consolidated income tax expense. The provision for income taxes reflects federal income taxes calculated on a consolidated basis and state and local income taxes which are calculated on a separate entity basis. 
 For state and local income tax purposes, certain losses incurred by a subsidiary may only be used to offset that subsidiary s income, with the exception of the restaurants operating in the District of Columbia. Accordingly, our overall effective tax rate has varied depending on the level of income and losses incurred at individual subsidiaries. 
 Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Act was signed into U.S. law on August 16, 2022. The Act includes various tax provisions, including an excise tax on stock repurchases, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives, and a corporate alternative minimum tax that generally applies to U.S. corporations with average adjusted financial statement income over a three-year period in excess of 1 billion. The Company does not expect the Act to materially impact its financial statements. 
 On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 CAA was enacted and provided clarification on the tax deductibility of expenses funded with PPP loans as fully deductible for tax purposes. During the years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, the Company recorded income of 272,000 and 2,420,000, respectively (including 6,000 and 65,000 of accrued interest, respectively), for financial reporting purposes related to the forgiveness of its PPP loans. The forgiveness of these amounts is not taxable. 
 
 The Company s overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected by factors such as the utilization of state and local net operating loss carryforwards, the generation of FICA tax credits and the mix of earnings by state taxing jurisdictions as Nevada does not impose a state income tax, as compared to the other major state and local jurisdictions in which the Company has operations. Our overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected by factors such as income earned by our VIEs, generation of FICA TIP credits and the mix of geographical income for state tax purposes as Nevada does not impose an income tax. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary source of capital has been cash provided by operations and, in recent years, bank and other borrowings to finance specific transactions, acquisitions and large remodeling projects. We utilize cash generated from operations to fund the cost of developing and opening new restaurants and smaller remodeling projects of existing restaurants we own. Consistent with many other restaurant operators, we typically use operating lease arrangements for our restaurants. In recent years we have been able to acquire the underlying real estate at several locations along with the restaurant operation. We believe that our operating lease arrangements provide appropriate leverage of our capital structure in a financially efficient manner. 
 The Company had a working capital deficit of 5,932,000 at September 30, 2023 as compared to working capital of 4,210,000 at October 1, 2022. This decrease is primarily the result of the prepayment of a promissory note in the amount of 6,666,000 on March 30, 2023 and the prepayment of three promissory notes in the aggregate amount of 6,046,000 on April 4, 2023. We believe that our existing cash balances and current banking facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements and finance our operating activities for at least the next 12 months. 
 Inflation 
 
 The country is currently experiencing multi-decade high inflation. Our profitability is dependent on, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the cost of food and other raw materials, labor, energy and other supplies and services. While we have not had material disruptions in our supply chain, we have experienced some product shortages and higher costs for many commodities. There has also been a general shortage in the availability of restaurant staff and hourly workers in certain

geographic areas in which we operate and has caused increases in the costs of recruiting and compensating such employees. In addition, certain operating and other costs, including health benefits, taxes, insurance, and other outside services, continue to increase with the general level of inflation and may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control. 
 
 While we have been able to offset inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by targeted increases in menu prices, coupled with more efficient purchasing practices, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. From time to time, competitive conditions will limit our menu pricing flexibility. In addition, macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer discretionary spending for food away from home could make additional menu price increases imprudent. There can be no assurance that all of our future cost increases can be offset by higher menu prices or that higher menu prices will be accepted by our restaurant customers without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns. 
 Cash Flows for the Years Ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2023 decreased to 8,386,000 as compared to 20,347,000 for the year ended October 1, 2022. This decrease was attributable to a decrease in consolidated net income and changes in net working capital primarily related to accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid, refundable and accrued income taxes and accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2023 was 1,276,000 compared to net cash used in investing activities for the year ended October 1, 2022 of (7,761,000). This increase resulted primarily from increased purchases of fixed assets associated with the renovation of Gallagher's Steakhouse and, in the current period, the proceeds from the maturity of a certificate of deposit. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2023 was (19,686,000) and resulted primarily from principal payments on notes payable of 16,334,000 (including the prepayment of a promissory note in the amount of 6,666,000 on March 30, 2023 and the prepayment of three promissory notes in the aggregate amount of 6,046,000 on April 4, 2023), the payment of dividends in the amount of 2,252,000 and the payment of distributions to non-controlling interests in the amount of 1,139,000. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended October 1, 2022 was (8,318,000) and resulted primarily from principal payments on notes payable of 6,512,000, the resumption of the payment of dividends in the amount of 894,000 and the payment of distributions to non-controlling interests in the amount of 1,615,000. 
 On November 9, 2022, February 9, 2023, May 9, 2023 and August 8, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") declared quarterly cash dividends of 0.125, 0.125, 0.1875 and 0.1875, respectively, per share, which were paid on December 13, 2022, March 14, 2023, June 13, 2023 and September 13, 2023 to the stockholders of record of the Company's common stock at the close of business on November 30, 2022, February 28, 2023, May 31, 2023 and August 31, 2023. Future decisions to pay or to increase or decrease dividends are at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon operating performance and other factors. 
 Restaurant Expansion and Other Developments 
 On April 8, 2022, the Company extended its lease for Gallagher's Steakhouse at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2032. In connection with the extension, the Company agreed to spend a minimum of 1,500,000 to materially refresh the premises by April 30, 2023 (as extended from September 30, 2022 due to supply chain issues). Accordingly, the property was substantially closed for renovation on February 5, 2023 and reopened on April 28, 2023. The total cost of the refresh was approximately 1,900,000. 
 On June 24, 2022, the Company extended its lease for America at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2033. In connection with the extension, the Company has agreed to spend a minimum of 4,000,000 to materially refresh the premises by December 31, 2024, subject to various extensions as set out in the agreement. No amounts have been expended to date related to this refresh. 
 On July 21, 2022, the Company extended its lease for the Village Eateries at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2034. As part of this extension, the Broadway Burger Bar and Grill and Gonzalez y Gonzalez , were carved out of the Village Eateries footprint and the extended date for those two locations is December 31, 2033. In connection with the extension, the Company has agreed to spend a minimum of 3,500,000 to materially refresh all three of these premises by March 31, 2024 (as extended from June 30, 2023), subject to various extensions as set out in the agreement. To date approximately 300,000 has been spent on this refresh. 
 Each of the above refresh obligations are to be consistent with designs approved by the landlord which shall not be unreasonably withheld. We have and will continue to pay all rent as required by the leases without abatement during construction. Note that our substantial completion of work set forth in plans approved by the landlord shall constitute our compliance with the requirements 
 20 

of the completion deadlines, regardless of whether or not the amount actually expended in connection therewith is less than the minimum. 
 On September 19, 2023, the Company extended the lease for its corporate office through December 31, 2038. The amended lease provides for rents, beginning on January 1, 2024, approximately 19 lower than the Company is currently paying. The lease also provides for, among other things, the ability for the Company to vacate the premises upon 12 months' notice. 
 The opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial pre-opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of personnel, excess kitchen costs, costs of supervision and other expenses during the pre-opening period and during a post-opening shake out period until operations can be considered to be functioning normally. The amount of such pre-opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened. 
 Our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year, which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry. To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons, we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants. There can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened, particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us, thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity. 
 We may take advantage of other opportunities we consider to be favorable, when they occur, depending upon the availability of financing and other factors. 
 Recent Restaurant Dispositions 
 On July 5, 2022, the Company terminated its lease for Lucky 7 at the Foxwoods Resort Casino. The closure did not result in a material change to the Company's operations. 
 During the 26 weeks ended April 1, 2023, the Company dissolved the entity which owned Clyde Frazier's Wine and Dine , which was closed in September of 2021. In connection with the dissolution, the Company reclassified the remaining non-controlling interest balance to additional paid-in capital. 
 Investment in and Receivable from New Meadowlands Racetrack 
 On March 12, 2013, the Company made a 4,200,000 investment in the New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC NMR through its purchase of a membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, an existing member of NMR with a 63.7 ownership interest. On November 19, 2013, the Company invested an additional 464,000 in NMR through a purchase of an additional membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC resulting in a total ownership of 11.6 of Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, and an effective ownership interest in NMR of 7.4 , subject to dilution. In 2015, the Company invested an additional 222,000 in NMR with no change in ownership. In February 2017, the Company funded its proportionate share 222,000) of a 3,000,000 capital call bringing its total investment to 5,108,000 with no change in ownership. 
 During the years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, the Company received distributions from NMR in the amounts of 52,000 and 421,000, respectively, which are included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations for the years then ended. 
 In addition to the Company s ownership interest in NMR, if casino gaming is approved at the Meadowlands and NMR is granted the right to conduct said gaming, the Company shall be granted the exclusive right to operate the food and beverage concessions in the gaming facility with the exception of one restaurant. 
 In conjunction with this investment, the Company, through a 97 owned subsidiary, Ark Meadowlands LLC AM VIE ), also entered into a long-term agreement with NMR for the exclusive right to operate food and beverage concessions serving the new raceway facilities (the Racing F B Concessions located in the new raceway grandstand constructed at the Meadowlands Racetrack in northern New Jersey. Under the agreement, NMR is responsible to pay for the costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the Racing F B Concessions, and all revenues and profits thereof inure to the benefit of NMR. AM VIE receives an annual fee equal to 5 of the net profits received by NMR from the Racing F B Concessions during each calendar year. 
 On April 25, 2014, the Company loaned 1,500,000 to Meadowlands Newmark, LLC. The note bears interest at 3 , compounded monthly and added to the principal, and is due in its entirety on January 31, 2024. The note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty or premium. The principal and accrued interest related to this note in the amounts of 1,399,000 and 1,357,000, are included in Investment In and Receivable From New Meadowlands Racetrack in the consolidated balance sheets 
 21 

at September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively. On April 30, 2023, the due date of the note was extended to June 30, 2029. 
 Notes Payable Bank 
 On March 30, 2023, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ), with its lender, Bank Hapoalim B.M. BHBM ). This facility, which matures on June 1, 2025, replaced our revolving credit facility which was entered into in June 1, 2018 (the "Prior Credit Agreement"). Under the terms of the Credit Agreement: (i) a promissory note under the Prior Credit Agreement in the amount of 6,666,000 was repaid, (ii) BHBM established a new revolving credit facility in the amount of 10,000,000 with a commitment termination date of May 31, 2025, (iii) the Company may use the revolving commitments of BHBM to obtain letters of credit up to a sublimit thereunder of 1,000,000, and (iv) the LIBOR rate option for all borrowings was replaced with the secured overnight financing rate for U.S. Government Securities SOFR ). Advances under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company's election at the time of the advance, at either BHBM's prime rate of interest plus a 0.45 spread or SOFR plus a 3.65 spread. In addition, there is a 0.30 per annum fee for any unused portion of the 10,000,000 revolving facility. As of September 30, 2023, no advances were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2023, the weighted average interest on the outstanding BHBM indebtedness was approximately 8.8 . The replacement of LIBOR with SOFR as a reference rate in our debt agreements did not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or materially affect our interest expense. 
 Borrowings under the Credit Agreement, which include the promissory notes as discussed in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements in the aggregate amount of 6,909,000, are secured by all tangible and intangible personal property (including accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, general intangibles, documents, chattel paper, instruments, letter-of-credit rights, investment property, intellectual property and deposit accounts) and fixtures of the Company. The loan agreements provide, among other things, that the Company meet minimum quarterly tangible net worth amounts, maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and meet minimum annual net income amounts. The loan agreements also contain customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants as well as customary negative covenants, subject to negotiated exceptions on liens, relating to other indebtedness, capital expenditures, liens, affiliate transactions, disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership. The Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2023 except for the minimum annual net income requirement (as a result of the non-cash goodwill impairment). On December 13, 2023, BHBM agreed to waive applicability of this covenant (and any breach arising therefrom) as of September 30, 2023. 
 Paycheck Protection Program Loans 
 During the year ended October 3, 2020, subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs (the Borrowers of the Company received loan proceeds from several banks (the Lenders in the aggregate amount of 14,995,000 (the PPP Loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP of the CARES Act, which was enacted March 27, 2020. In addition, during the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2021, one of our consolidated VIEs received a second draw PPP Loan in the amount of 111,000. The PPP Loans were evidenced by individual promissory notes of each of the Borrowers (together, the Notes in favor of the Lender, which Notes bore interest at the rate of 1.00 per annum. Funds from the PPP Loans were to be used only for payroll and related costs, costs used to continue group health care benefits, mortgage payments, rent, utilities, and interest on other debt obligations that were incurred by a Borrower prior to February 15, 2020 (the Qualifying Expenses ). Under the terms of the PPP Loans, some or all of the amounts thereunder, including accrued interest, were to be forgiven if they were used for Qualifying Expenses as described in and in compliance with the CARES Act. During the years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, 272,000 and 2,420,000 of PPP Loans, respectively (including 6,000 and 66,000 of accrued interest, respectively), were forgiven. During the years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, the Company made payments related to the unforgiven portion of PPP Loans in the aggregate amount of 531,000 and 1,571,000, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, no PPP Loans were outstanding; however, the Company was denied forgiveness of one PPP Loan in fiscal 2023 in the amount of 280,000 and accordingly such amount was repaid. The Company filed an appeal concurrent with the repayment, which was granted, and the amount was forgiven and refunded to the Company in November 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. While all of these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
 22 

We believe that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows for the periods presented in this report. 
 Below are listed certain policies that management believes are critical: 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We recognize revenues when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a restaurant guest or other customer. Revenues from restaurant operations are presented net of discounts, coupons, employee meals and complimentary meals and recognized when food, beverage and retail products are sold. Sales tax collected from customers is excluded from sales and the obligation is included in sales tax payable until the taxes are remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities. Catering service revenue is generated through contracts with customers whereby the customer agrees to pay a contract rate for the service. Revenues from catered events are recognized in income upon satisfaction of the performance obligation (the date the event is held) and all customer payments, including nonrefundable upfront deposits, are deferred as a liability until such time. 
 Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized upon redemption. Deferrals are not reduced for potential non-use as we generally have a legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions in which they are sold. 
 Other revenues include purchase service fees which represent commissions earned by a subsidiary of the Company for providing purchasing services to other restaurant groups, as well as license fees, property management fees and other rentals. 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The accounting estimates that require management s most difficult and subjective judgments include allowances for potential bad debts on receivables, the useful lives and recoverability of its assets, such as property and intangibles, fair values of financial instruments and share-based compensation, the realizable value of its tax assets and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Because of the uncertainty in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 Long-Lived Assets 
 Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment subject to amortization, and right-of-use assets ("ROU assets") are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of long-lived assets, the Company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long-lived assets. If the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value is reduced to its fair value. Various factors including estimated future sales growth and estimated profit margins are included in this analysis. 
 The Company considers a triggering event related to long-lived assets or ROU assets in a net asset position to have occurred related to a specific restaurant if the restaurant s cash flows for the last 12 months are less than a minimum threshold or if consistent levels of undiscounted cash flows for the remaining lease period are less than the carrying value of the restaurant s assets. Additionally, the Company considers a triggering event related to ROU assets to have occurred related to a specific lease if the location has been subleased and future estimated sublease income is less than current lease payments. If the Company concludes that the carrying value of certain long-lived and ROU assets will not be recovered based on expected undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the long-lived or ROU assets to their estimated fair value. The fair value is measured on a nonrecurring basis using unobservable (Level 3) inputs. There is uncertainty in the projected undiscounted future cash flows used in the Company's impairment review analysis, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions. If actual performance does not achieve the projections, or if the assumptions used change in the future, the Company may be required to recognize impairment charges in future periods, and such charges could be material. 
 Based on the results of this analysis, no impairment charges were recognized related to long-lived assets and ROU assets during the years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022. Given the inherent uncertainty in projecting results of restaurants under the current circumstances, the Company is monitoring the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets of several restaurants on an ongoing basis. For these restaurants, if expected performance is not realized, an impairment charge may be recognized in future periods, and such charge could be material. 
 23 

Recoverability of Investment in New Meadowlands Racetrack NMR 
 The carrying value of our investment in Meadowlands Newmark LLC, which has a 63.7 ownership in NMR, is determined using the cost method. In accordance with the cost method, our initial investment is recorded at cost and we record dividend income when applicable, if dividends are declared. We review our investment in NMR each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on its fair value. 
 As a result, we performed an assessment of the recoverability of our indirect investment in NMR as of September 30, 2023 which involved critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management estimated include, among others, the probability of gambling being approved in northern New Jersey and NMR obtaining a license to operate a casino, revenue levels, cost of capital, marketing spending, tax rates and capital spending. 
 In performing this assessment, we estimate the fair value of our investment in NMR using our best estimate of these assumptions which we believe would be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and our inability as a minority shareholder to control certain outcomes and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. 
 As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, future impairment charges could result. 
 Leases 
 We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. An arrangement contains a lease if it implicitly or explicitly identifies an asset to be used and conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset in exchange for consideration. As a lessee, we include operating leases in Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized upon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. Options are included when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Amendments or modifications to lease terms are accounted for as variable lease payments. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less are accounted for using the practical expedient which allows for straight-line rent expense over the remaining term of the lease. 
 Deferred Income Tax Valuation Allowance 
 We provide such allowance due to uncertainty that some of the deferred tax amounts may not be realized. Certain items, such as state and local tax loss carryforwards, are dependent on future earnings or the availability of tax strategies. Future results could require an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance and a resulting adjustment to income in such period. 
 Goodwill and Trademarks 
 Goodwill and trademarks are not amortized, but are subject to impairment analysis. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and trademarks annually (at the end of our fourth quarter) and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or trademarks are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 With respect to goodwill, the Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed quantitative impairment test. The Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test. When performing the quantitative test, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of our equity, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value. 
 
 Due to the volatility of the Company's stock price in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the upcoming expiration of the current Bryant Park Grill Cafe and The Porch at Bryant Park leases on April 30, 2025 and the related requests for proposals from the landlord for both locations received in July 2023 and September 2023, respectively (see Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements), the Company determined that there were indicators of potential impairment of its goodwill as of September 30, 2023. As such, the Company performed a qualitative and quantitative assessment 
 24 

for its goodwill and recorded a pre-tax noncash goodwill impairment charge of 10,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023 (see Note 7 Goodwill, Trademarks and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The fair value of the equity was determined using the income approach. Given the relatively low volume of shares traded and the lack of reliable market data as of September 30, 2023, the Company determined the income approach provided the best approximation of fair value. In the income approach, we utilized a discounted cash flow analysis, which involved estimating the expected future after-tax cash flows generated and then discounting those cash flows to present value, reflecting the relevant risks associated with the achievement of projected cash flows, the possibility that the Bryant Park Grill Cafe and The Porch at Bryant Park leases may not be renewed beyond their expirations on April 30, 2025 (see Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies), and the time value of money. This approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted cash flows from operations, and discount rates that reflect the risk inherent in the future cash flows. More specifically, the weighted average cost of capital is a sensitive estimate as it reflects the market conditions including the risk that the Bryant Park Grill Caf and The Porch at Bryant Park leases will not be renewed. The Company did not record any impairment to its goodwill during the year ended October 1, 2022. 
 
 Our impairment analysis for trademarks consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets. This comparison is made based on a review of historical, current and forecasted sales and profit levels, as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment. For the years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, our impairment analysis did not result in any other charges related to trademarks. 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 The Company measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes it as expense over the applicable vesting period using the straight-line method. Excess income tax benefits related to share-based compensation expense that must be recognized directly in equity are considered financing rather than operating cash flow activities. 
 The fair value of each of the Company s stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses assumptions that relate to the expected volatility of the Company s common stock, the expected dividend yield of our stock, the expected life of the options and the risk-free interest rate. The Company issues new shares upon the exercise of employee stock options.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2023 (the end of the period covered by this report), management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, at the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our 
 25 

periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 based upon the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on our assessment, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023. 
 This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting as management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the permanent exemption of the SEC that permits us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control 
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
 Ark Restaurants Corp. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ark Restaurants Corp. and Subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the entity s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to Ark Restaurants Corp. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Long-lived Asset and Right-of-Use Asset Valuation (Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 Long-lived assets, such as property and plant and equipment subject to amortization, and right-of-use assets ("ROU assets") are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of long-lived assets, the Company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long-lived assets. If the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value is reduced to its fair value. Various factors including estimated future sales growth and estimated profit margins are included in this analysis. 
 
 The Company considers a triggering event related to long-lived assets or ROU assets in a net asset position to have occurred related to a specific restaurant if the restaurant s undiscounted cash flows for the last 12 months are less than a minimum threshold or if projected levels of undiscounted cash flows for the remaining lease period are less than the carrying value of the 
 F-1 

restaurant s assets. Additionally, the Company considers a triggering event related to ROU assets to have occurred related to a specific lease if the location has been subleased and future estimated sublease income is less than current lease payments. If the Company concludes that the carrying value of certain long-lived assets and ROU assets will not be recovered based on expected undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the long-lived or ROU assets to their estimated fair value. 
 
 Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in performing their long-lived asset and right-of-use asset impairment analysis specifically surrounding the development of undiscounted cash flow forecasts. The related audit effort in evaluating management's judgments in determining the cash flow forecasts to be utilized was complex, subjective, and challenging, and required a high degree of auditor judgment. 
 
 How our Audit Addressed the Critical Audit Matter 
 
 Our principal audit procedures related to this critical audit matter included the following, among others: 
 
 We gained an understanding of and evaluated the design and implementation of the Company s controls that address the risk of material misstatement related to potential impairment. 
 We evaluated management's significant accounting policies related to the consideration of impairment for long-lived assets for reasonableness. 
 We tested the reasonableness of the underlying data used to determine the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of undiscounted future cash flows utilized in the impairment analysis for the restaurants by comparing forecasted undiscounted cash flows to historical cash flows from each restaurant location, and evaluating management's future operating forecasts. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate that no impairment charges were appropriate during the year. 
 
 Goodwill Valuation (Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The Company s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of the Company to its carrying value. The Company determined the income approach provided the best approximation of fair value given the relatively low volume of shares of the Company s stock traded and the lack of reliable market data. In the income approach the Company utilized the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margin. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The Company recorded an impairment charge of 10,000,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Significant judgment is exercised by management in estimating its fair value and the difference between its fair value and carrying value. Given these factors, the related audit effort in evaluating management s judgments in determining the valuation of goodwill was challenging, subjective, and complex and required a high degree of auditor judgment. 
 
 How our Audit Addressed the Critical Audit Matter 
 
 Our principal audit procedures related to this critical audit matter included the following, among others: 
 
 We gained an understanding of and evaluated the design and implementation of the Company s controls that address the risk of material misstatement related to potential impairment. 
 We evaluated management s significant accounting policies related to the consideration of goodwill impairment for reasonableness. 
 We evaluated management s ability to accurately forecast future revenues and profit margins by comparing actual results to management s historical forecasts. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of management s assumptions by: 
 Comparing forecasts of revenue and profit margins to historical revenues and profit margins. 
 Reading select internal communications to management and the Board of Directors. 
 Considering the remaining lease terms of the company s locations as the lease terms could have an impact on future cashflows. Our consideration included challenging management s assumptions in its valuation regarding the risk of non-renewal of significant leases in its various locations. 
 Involving a valuation professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in considering the reasonableness of the weighted average cost of capital used in the discounted cash flow forecast

 restaurants and bars, fast food concepts and catering operations, exclusively in the United States, that have similar economic characteristics, nature of products and service, class of customers and distribution methods. The Company believes it meets the criteria for aggregating its operating segments into a single reporting segment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. 
 The Company operates restaurants in New York City, in Washington, D.C., in Las Vegas, Nevada, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in Florida and on the gulf coast of Alabama. The Las Vegas operations include restaurants within the New York-New York Hotel and Casino Resort and operation of the hotel s room service, banquet facilities, employee dining room and food court concepts and restaurant within the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino. In Atlantic City, New Jersey, the Company operates a restaurant in the Tropicana Hotel and Casino. The Florida operations include The Rustic Inn in Dania Beach, Shuckers in Jensen Beach, JB's on the Beach in Deerfield Beach, The Blue Moon Fish Company in Fort Lauderdale and the operation of fast food facilities in Tampa and fast food facilities in Hollywood, each at a Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. In Alabama, the Company operates Original Oyster Houses , in Gulf Shores and in Spanish Fort. 
 COVID-19 Pandemic and Inflation Recent global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic ("COVID-19"), have adversely affected global economies, disrupted global supply chains and labor force participation and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. As a result, we experienced significant and variable disruptions to our business as federal, state and local restrictions were mandated, among other remedial measures, to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. While restrictions on the type of permitted operating model and occupancy capacity may continue to change, during fiscal 2022 all of our restaurants operated with no restrictions, other than in New York City where customers were required to show proof of vaccination through November 1, 2022. 
 In addition to the associated impacts of COVID-19, our operating results have been impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic factors, leading to increased commodity and wage inflation and other increased costs. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 and its variants, along with other geopolitical and macroeconomic events, could lead to further government mandates, including but not limited to capacity restrictions, shifts in consumer behavior, wage inflation, staffing challenges, product and services cost inflation and disruptions in our supply chain. If these factors significantly impact our cash flow in the future, we may again implement mitigation actions such as suspending dividends, increasing borrowings or modifying our operating strategies. Some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our business, including possible impairments of assets.

for furniture, fixtures and equipment and up to years for buildings and related improvements. Amortization of improvements to leased properties is computed using the straight-line method based upon the initial term of the applicable lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements, whichever is less, and ranges from to years. For leases with renewal periods at the Company s option, if failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty to the Company, management may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of appropriate estimated useful lives. Routine expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. Major replacements and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or disposition of fixed assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 The Company includes in construction in progress, improvements to restaurants that are under construction or are undergoing substantial renovations. Once the projects have been completed, the Company begins depreciating and amortizing the assets. Start-up costs incurred during the construction period of restaurants, including rental of premises, training and payroll, are expensed as incurred. 
 impairment charges were recognized related to long-lived assets and ROU assets during the year ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022. Given the inherent uncertainty in projecting results of restaurants under the current circumstances, the Company is monitoring the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets of several restaurants on an ongoing basis. For these restaurants, if expected performance is not realized, an impairment charge may be recognized in future periods, and such charge could be material.

in the fourth quarter of 2023. (see Note 7 Goodwill, Trademarks and Intangible Assets). Given the relatively low volume of shares traded and the lack of reliable market data as of September 30, 2023, the Company determined the income approach provided the best approximation of fair value. The Company did t record any impairment to its goodwill during the year ended October 1, 2022. 
 
 Our impairment analysis for trademarks consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets. This comparison is made based on a review of historical, current and forecasted sales and profit levels, as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment. For the years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, our impairment analysis did not result in any other charges related to trademarks.

On November 19, 2013, the Company invested an additional in NMR through a purchase of an additional membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC resulting in a total ownership of of Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, and an effective ownership interest in NMR of , subject to dilution. In 2015, the Company invested an additional in NMR and on February 7, 2017, the Company invested an additional in NMR, both as a result of capital calls, bringing its total investment to with no change in ownership. The Company accounts for this investment at cost, less impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-01. There are no observable prices for this investment. 
 During the years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, the Company received distributions from NMR in the amounts of and , respectively, which are included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations for the years then ended. 
 The Company evaluated its investment in NMR for impairment and concluded that its fair value exceeds the carrying value. Accordingly, the Company did not record any impairment during the year ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022. Any future changes in the carrying value of our investment in NMR will be reflected in earnings. 
 In addition to the Company s ownership interest in NMR through Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, if casino gaming is approved at the Meadowlands and NMR is granted the right to conduct said gaming, neither of which can be assured, the Company shall be granted the exclusive right to operate the food and beverage concessions in the gaming facility with the exception of one restaurant. 
 In conjunction with this investment, the Company, through a owned subsidiary, Ark Meadowlands LLC AM VIE ), also entered into a long-term agreement with NMR for the exclusive right to operate food and beverage concessions serving the new raceway facilities (the Racing F B Concessions located in the new raceway grandstand constructed at the Meadowlands Racetrack in northern New Jersey. Under the agreement, NMR is responsible to pay for the costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the Racing F B Concessions, and all revenues and profits thereof inure to the benefit of NMR. AM VIE receives an annual fee equal to of the net profits received by NMR from the Racing F B Concessions during each calendar year. AM VIE is a variable interest entity; however, based on qualitative consideration of the contracts with AM VIE, the operating structure of AM VIE, the Company s role with AM VIE, and that the Company is not obligated to absorb expected losses of AM VIE, the Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary and not required to consolidate the operations of AM VIE.

 to years and typically include renewal options. Renewal options are recognized as part of the ROU assets and lease liabilities if it is reasonably certain at the date of adoption that we would exercise the options to extend the lease. Our real estate leases typically provide for fixed minimum rent payments and/or contingent rent payments based upon sales in excess of specified thresholds. When the achievement of such sales thresholds are deemed to be probable, variable lease expense is accrued in proportion to the sales recognized during the period. For operating leases that include rent holidays and rent escalation clauses, we recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term from the date we take possession of the leased property. We record the straight-line lease expense and any contingent rent, if applicable, in occupancy expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Many of our real estate leases also require us to pay real estate taxes, common area maintenance costs and other occupancy costs non-lease components which are included in occupancy related expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 
 As there were no explicit rates provided in our leases, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

 (d) Intentional Misconduct is intended to include reckless conduct (meaning any highly unreasonable act or omission, involving not merely simple, or even inexcusable negligence, but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care, and that is either known to the executive or is so obvious the executive must have been aware of it), but is not intended to include negligent conduct or grossly negligent conduct not meeting that definition. Further, the term intentional misconduct shall not include conduct in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company.

In the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall reasonably promptly recover, unless exempt pursuant to Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) and subsection (c) of this Section 4, from Covered Persons (without regard to any taxes paid thereon by the Covered Person and provided such person was a Covered Person during the applicable Performance Period) who Received Incentive-Based Compensation from the Company, based on erroneous data, during the Look-Back Period.

For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of erroneously awarded compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement 
 
 i. the amount shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received and 
 
 ii. the Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq. 
 
 (c) Non-Recovery of Recoverable Amounts . The Company shall recover the amounts recoverable pursuant to this Section 4 unless 
 
 i. the Administrator, or in the absence of the Administrator, a majority of the independent directors on the Board has determined that recovery would be impracticable and 
 
 ii. one of the conditions listed in paragraphs (A), (B), or (C) of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608(b)(1)(iv) are met. 

5. Discretionary Recovery of Additional Amounts .

involved) use reasonable efforts to recover from such Covered Person up to 100 of the Incentive-Based Compensation (without regard to any taxes paid thereon by the Covered Person), and not just the difference referred to in Section 4. 
 
 6. Method of Recovery . The Board shall determine, in its sole discretion, the method of recovering, as the case may be, Incentive-Based Compensation hereunder, which may include, without limitation, any one or more of the following 
 
 (a) requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive-Based Compensation previously paid 
 
 (b) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer or other disposition of any equity-based awards 
 
 (c) cancelling or rescinding some or all outstanding vested or unvested equity-based awards 
 
 (d) adjusting or withholding from unpaid compensation or other set-off 
 
 (e) cancelling or setting-off against planned future grants of equity-based awards and or 
 
 (f) any other method permitted by applicable law or contract.

This Policy will be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with any applicable rules or regulations adopted by the SEC or Nasdaq pursuant to Section 10D of the Exchange Act or the Nasdaq Listing Rules (the Applicable Rules and any other applicable law and will otherwise be interpreted (including in the determination of amounts recoverable) in the business judgment of the Board.

To the extent this Policy is in any manner deemed inconsistent with the Applicable Rules, this Policy shall be treated as retroactively amended to be compliant with such Applicable Rules. Moreover, nothing in this Policy shall be deemed to limit the Company's right to terminate employment of any Covered Person, to seek recovery of other compensation paid to a Covered Person, or to pursue other rights or remedies available to the Company under applicable law. 
 
 8. Disclosure of Policy and Accounting Restatements . The Company shall file this Policy with the SEC and, in the event of an Accounting Restatement, will disclose the information relating to such Accounting Restatement in accordance with the Applicable Rules. 
 
 9. No Indemnification . The Company shall not indemnify or agree to indemnify any Covered Person against the loss of erroneously awarded compensation nor shall the Company pay or agree to pay any insurance premium to cover the loss of erroneously awarded compensation. 
 
 10. Amendments . The Board may amend, modify or terminate this policy in whole or in part at any time in its sole discretion and may adopt such rules and procedures that it deems necessary or appropriate to implement this policy or to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
