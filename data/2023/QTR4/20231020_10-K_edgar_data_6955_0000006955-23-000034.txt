 PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 General 
 Enerpac Tool Group Corp. is a premier industrial tools, services, technology and solutions company serving a broad and diverse set of customers in more than 100 countries. Enerpac Tool Group's businesses are global leaders of high pressure hydraulic tools, controlled force products and solutions for precise positioning of heavy loads that help customers around the world safely, reliably and efficiently tackle some of the most challenging, complex, and often hazardous jobs. The Company was founded in 1910 and is headquartered in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. The Company has one reportable segment, the Industrial Tools Services Segment ("IT S"). The IT S segment is primarily engaged in the design, manufacture and distribution of branded hydraulic and mechanical tools and in providing services and tool rental to the industrial, maintenance, infrastructure, oil gas, alternative energy and other markets. Financial information related to the Company's reportable segment is included in Note 15, "Business Segment, Geographic and Customer Information" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Our businesses provide an array of products and services across multiple markets and geographies, which results in significant diversification. The IT S segment and the Company are well-positioned to drive shareholder value through a sustainable business strategy built on well-established brands, broad global distribution and end markets, with a clear focus on the core tools and services business, and disciplined capital deployment. 
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement ("SPA") to sell the remaining businesses within our legacy Engineered Components Systems ("EC S") segment. We closed the transaction during our first quarter of fiscal 2020. The divestiture of the EC S segment was a strategic shift to become a pure-play industrial tools and services company. As such, retained liabilities associated with the former EC S segment are considered discontinued operations in all periods presented herein. 
 Our Business Model 
 Our long-term goal is to create sustainable returns for our shareholders through above-market growth in our core business, expanding our margins, generating strong cash flow, and being disciplined in the deployment of our capital. We intend to grow through execution of our organic growth strategy, focused on key vertical markets that benefit from long-term macro trends, driving customer driven innovation, expansion of our digital ecosystem to acquire and engage customers, and an expansion in emerging markets such as Asia Pacific. In addition to organic growth, we also focus on margin expansion through operational efficiency techniques, including lean, continuous improvement and 80/20, to drive productivity and lo wer costs, as well as 
 1 

optimizing our selling, general and administrative expenses through consolidation and shared service implementation . We also apply these techniques and pricing actions to offset commodity increases and inflationary pricing. Finally, cash flow generation is critical to achieving our financial and long-term strategic objectives. We believe driving profitable growth and margin expansion will result in cash flow generation, which we seek to supplement through minimizing primary working capital. We intend to allocate the cash flow that results from the execution of our strategy in a disciplined way toward investment in our businesses, maintaining our strong balance sheet, disciplined M A and opportunistically returning capital to shareholders. We anticipate the compounding effect of reinvesting in our business will fuel further growth and profitable returns. 
 In March 2022, the Company announced the start of its ASCEND transformation program ASCEND ). ASCEND s key initiatives include accelerating organic growth strategies, improving operational excellence and production efficiency by utilizing a Lean approach, and driving greater efficiency and productivity in selling, general and administrative expense by better leveraging resources to create a more efficient and agile organization. In support of the ASCEND initiatives, the Company anticipates investing approximately 70- 75 million over the life of the program, which is expected to be fully implemented by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, with an expected annual operating profit improvement from the program in the range of 50- 60 million. Through the end of fiscal 2023, the Company has realized approximately 54 million of annual operating profit from the execution of the ASCEND program and had invested approximately 60 million as part of the program. 
 In June 2022, the Company approved a restructuring plan in connection with the initiatives identified as part of the ASCEND transformation program (see Note 3, ASCEND Transformation Program in the notes to the consolidated financial statements) to drive greater efficiency and productivity in global selling, general and administrative resources. The total costs of this plan were then estimated at 6 to 10 million, constituting predominately severance and other employee-related costs to be incurred as cash expenditures and impacting both IT S and Corporate. On September 23, 2022, the Company approved an updated restructuring plan. The costs of this updated plan (which includes the amounts for the plan approved in June 2022) are estimated at 10 to 15 million. These costs are expected to be incurred over the expected duration of the transformation program, ending in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Description of Business Segments 
 Industrial Tools Services Reportable Segment 
 IT S is a global supplier of both products and services to a broad array of end markets, including infrastructure, industrial maintenance, repair and operations, oil gas, mining, alternative and renewable energy, and civil construction markets. 
 Our primary products include branded tools, cylinders, pumps, hydraulic torque wrenches and highly engineered heavy lifting technology solutions. Examples of our products include high-forc e hydraulic and mechanical tools (cylinders, pumps, valves, bolt tensioners, specialty tools and other miscellaneous products), which are designed to allow users to apply controlled force and motion to increase productivity, reduce labor costs and make work safer and easier to perform. These tools operate at very high pressures of approximately 5,000 to 12,000 pounds per square inch. With our products used in a wide variety of end markets, they are often deployed in harsh operating conditions, such as machining, infrastructure maintenance and repair, and oil gas production, where safety is a key differentiator. As a result, we hold ourselves to a world-class safety standard to protect both our employees and those using our products and services. 
 On the services side of the segment, our highly trained technicians provide maintenance and manpower services on customer assets to meet their specific needs including bolting, machining, and joint integrity. We also provide rental services for certain of our products. 
 Our branded tools and services are primarily marketed through the Enerpac, Hydratight, Larzep and Simplex brand names. 
 The segment delivers products and services primarily through our world-class, global network of distributors, as well as direct sales to OEMs and select end users. Examples of industrial distributors include W.W. Grainger, MSC and Blackwoods. 
 Other Operating Segment 
 The Cortland Industrial and Medical operating segments, which primarily design and manufacture high performance synthetic ropes and biomedical textiles, do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds to be considered reportable segments, and together represent the Other operating segment. Therefore, the results are not disclosed separately as would be required if the Other operating segment were considered a reportable segment, and as the business is not closely related to the IT S segment, results are not aggregated to be included in the results of the IT S reportable segment. On July 11, 2023, the Company completed the sale of the Cortland Industrial business see Note 5, "Discontinued Operations and Other Divestiture Activities" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements). C ertain information related to the Other operating segment is disclosed within Note 15, "Business Segment, Geographic, and Customer Information" in the notes to the consolidated financial 
 2 

statements in order to comply with requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("US GAAP") to reconcile certain required disclosures to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Acquisitions and Divestitures 
 For a summary of recent divestiture transactions impacting continuing operations, see Note 5, "Discontinued Operations and Other Divestiture Activities" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 International Business 
 Our products and services are generally available globally, with our principal markets outside the United States being Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In fiscal 2023, we derived 39 of our net sales from the United States, 25 from Europe, 14 from the Middle East, 12 from Asia and 10 from other geographic areas. We have operations around the world that allow us to draw on the skills of a global workforce, provide flexibility to our operations, drive economies of scale, provide revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual countries, and facilitate access to new markets. Although international operations are subject to certain risks, we continue to believe that a global presence is key to maintaining strong relationships with many of our global customers and suppliers. Financial information related to the Company's geographic footprint of our continuing operations is included in Note 15, "Business Segment, Geographic and Customer Information" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Product Development and Engineering 
 We conduct research and development a ctivities to develop new products and to enhance the functionality, effectiveness, ease of use and reliability of our existing products. We believe that our engineering and research and development efforts have been, and continue to be, key drivers of our success in the marketplace. Our advanced design and engineering capabilities contribute to the development of innovative and highly engineered products, maintain our technological leadership and enhance our ability to provide c ustomers with unique and customized solutions and products. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide new innovative tools and services to grow our market share. Research and development ("R D") costs are expensed as incurred. R D costs were 9 million in fiscal 2023, 7 million in fiscal 2022 and 7 million in fiscal 2021. 
 The Company holds numerous patents and trademarks. While no individual patent is believed to be of such importance that its termination would have a material adverse effect on our business, the termination of certain of our trademarks, including ENERPAC , SIMPLEX , HYDRATIGHT and LARZEP DESIGN , could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Competition 
 The markets for our products are highly competitive. We provide a diverse and broad range of industrial products and services to numerous global end markets, many of which are highly fragmented. Although we face larger competitors in several served markets, some of our competition is comprised of smaller companies which may lack the footprint or financial resources to serve global customers. We compete for business principally on the basis of customer service, product quality and availability, engineering and research and development expertise. In addition, we believe that our cost structure, strategic global sourcing capabilities and global distribution support our competitive position. 
 Manufacturing and Operations 
 While we do have manufacturing capabilities including machining and fabrication, our manufacturing consists primarily of light assembly of components we source from a net work of global suppliers. We have implemented single piece flow processes in most of our plants, which reduces inventory levels, lowers re-work costs and shortens lead times to customers. Components are built to our highly engineered specifications by a variety of suppliers in best-cost locations including various countries in Asia. We have built strong relationships with our key suppliers and, while we single source certain of our components, in many cases there are several qualified alternative sources. 
 Raw Material Costs, Inflation and Tariffs 
 We source materials and components from a network of global suppliers. These items are typically available from multiple suppliers. Raw materials that go into the components we source, such as steel, aluminum, plastic resin, brass, steel wire and rubber, are subject to price fluctuations and tariffs, which could have an impact on our results. We have been able to offset the impact of inflation with pricing actions, manufacturing efficiencies and other cost reductions. In addition, several of our products have been subject to tariffs, but to date we have been able to offset the majority of additional costs from tariffs through price increases. We continue to manage our supply chain to mitigate ongoing risks associated with the evolving political and inflationary environments.

Order Backlogs and Seasonality 
 Our operating segments have a relatively short order-to-ship cycle. We had order backlogs of 54 million and 72 million at August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in our order backlog during the fiscal year was primarily due to alleviated pressure on the supply chain. Assuming no significant supply chain constraints arise after the date of this report, substantially all of the backlog at August 31, 2023 is expected to be filled within twelve months. 
 While we typically experience a stronger second half to our fiscal year, our consolidated sales are not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. 
 
 Percentages of Sales by Fiscal Quarter 
 2023 2022 Quarter 1 (September - November) 23 23 Quarter 2 (December - February) 24 24 Quarter 3 (March - May) 26 27 Quarter 4 (June - August) 27 26 100 100 
 Human Capital Management 
 The goal of human capital management strategy and practices is for Enerpac to be considered an employer of choice, and our initiatives and programs are predicated on making this objective a reality. 
 The talent that makes up our workforce (approximately 2,100 employees as of August 31, 2023) is critical to the success of our company and the ability to deliver shareholder value. Our talent development framework is built around a robust performance management and development structure. Together with their leaders, employees establish annual goals and objectives that align directly with our organizational commitments. We monitor progress throughout the year, with candid and frequent dialogue encouraged along the way, and, new for fiscal 2024, a formal check-in process to facilitate a clear understanding of goals and the status of progress toward achieving those goals. Bi-annually, our Executive Leadership Team ("ELT") reviews the skills we require to execute our corporate strategy and key role requirements to identify development opportunities for our emerging talent. Annually, we conduct performance review and succession planning, and we promote a long-term career development view by encouraging the creation of unique individual development plans. Training opportunities for all levels of the organization are available and focus on skill, competency and leadership development. We believe in coaching and the sharing of perspectives, and we facilitate mentorship opportunities for the benefit of our workforce. We are committed to devoting the time, resources and planning necessary to maximize the potential of our employees' career development, as well as address the future skill needs of our organization. 
 We offer competitive compensation and benefits tailored to the geographical markets and industries in which we operate. In the U.S., employees who work more than 30 hours per week are eligible for a comprehensive menu of benefits, including paid time off, healthcare (health, dental, and vision) coverage, short and long-term disability, life and accidental disability insurance, a 401(k) retirement plan with a Company match and immediate vesting, access to our employee assistance program, an annual bonus program with broad participation, equity incentive programs, an employee stock ownership plan that allows employees to buy company shares at a discount, flexible work arrangements, and up to 12 weeks of parental leave, of which six weeks are paid at an employee's full salary. In fiscal 2023, we increased our tuition reimbursement to 5,250 for associate and undergraduate programs and 7,500 for graduate programs, while also offering the same level of reimbursement to part time workers as full-time workers. During fiscal 2023, we expanded our supplemental life and spousal insurance offering. We continue to evaluate enhancements to our compensation and benefit programs in all locations to ensure we remain competitive and meet the needs of our employees. 
 Diversity, Equity, Inclusion Belonging. Diversity, Equity, Inclusion Belonging ("DEIB") remains a core tenet of our organizational ethos, championed by our ELT and management at all levels. Our unwavering commitment to fostering an inclusive culture of belonging is reflected in our four key DEIB pillars: prioritize cultivating a diverse and inclusive workplace culture, support education and skill building opportunities for our employees, broaden our talent acquisition efforts to attract diversity, and empower employees through employee resource groups ("ERGs"). 
 We include diverse representation in our slates for all positions and will continue to do so. At the end of fiscal 2023, our board of directors includes three female (30 and one racially diverse (10 individual. We firmly believe that embedding diversity into our core strategy not only aligns with our values but also provides a competitive advantage, attracting exceptional talent, leveraging diverse perspectives, and ultimately driving value creation for our shareholders. 
 Employee Safety . The safety, health, and well-being of our employees, contractors, and visitors at our sites globally is our top priority and a principle that is deeply embedded in our culture. Our leaders and employees at all levels embrace our health, 
 4 

safety, security, environment, and quality HSSEQ programs, which translates into an enterprise-wide obligation to provide healthy, safe and productive work environments for our employees and deliver high standards of safety and quality in the products, services and solutions for our customers and end-users. At the heart of our HSSEQ efforts is a desire to foster a culture of continuous improvement and employee empowerment through training, frequent and constructive management engagement, a risk-based evaluation of business activities and behaviors, and the deployment of programs and resources to mitigate those risks. We continually track and report our performance, including thorough reviews of incidents, near-misses, and quality issues; and management accountability and discussion of these improvement opportunities is a cornerstone of all business reviews. We finished the year with a total case incident rate (TCIR) of 0.64. This is up slightly year-over-year as fiscal 2022 had a TCIR of 0.61. This puts our performance in the top quartile in comparison to the BLS NAICS bracket for Machinery Manufacturing (333) for companies with greater than 1,000 employees.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing the Company. If any of the events contemplated by the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, also may adversely impact our business, including our ability to execute our strategic growth and profitability objectives. 
 Risks Related to Economic Conditions 
 Supply chain issues, including shortages of adequate component supply, that increase our costs or cause delays in our ability to fulfill orders, or a failure by us to estimate customer demand properly, could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and our relationships with customers. 
 We are reliant on our supply chain for components and raw materials to manufacture our products and provide services to our customers, and this reliance could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results. We may experience a reduction or interruption in supply due to factors beyond our control, including as a geopolitical conflicts and the imposition of international sanctions in response thereto, a significant natural disaster, pandemics, or shortages in global freight capacity. Our vendors may be unable to meet our demand for raw materials or components, or significantly increase lead times for deliveries, which may be unable to offset through alternate sources of supply, or impose significant increases in the price of critical components and raw materials that we may be unable to pass along to our customers. In addition, a failure by us to appropriately forecast or adjust our requirements for components or raw materials based on our business needs and volatility in demand for our products may impact our ability to timely procure raw materials and components necessary to maintain desired productivity in our operations. These supply chain issues could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. 
 We procure certain components for our products from single or limited suppliers. In the event of supply disruptions from these suppliers, we may not be able to diversify our supply base for such components in a timely manner or may experience quality issues with alternate sources. Further, we procure a significant portion of our components from suppliers located in China, and we are therefore exposed to potential disruptions in deliveries from these suppliers due to political tensions with China, geopolitical risks, government-mandated facility closures in China due to public health matters (such as the COVID-19 outbreaks), energy shortages or other causes. Our growth and ability to meet customer demand depend in large part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of components and raw materials from our suppliers, and significant disruptions in their supply could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. 
 We have in the recent past experienced supply shortages and inflationary pressures for certain components and raw materials that were important to our manufacturing proc ess due to a number of the factors described above. Growth in the global economy may exacerbate these pressures on us and our suppliers, and we expect these supply chain challenges and cost impacts may continue to impact us in the future. Although we have generally secured additional supply from existing or alternate suppliers or taken other mitigating actions when such disruptions have occurred in past periods, there is no guarantee we can continue to do so in the future, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. When facing component supply-related challenges, we may also increase our inventories and purchase commitments to shorten lead times and ensure adequate inventories to meet customer expectations. If the demand for our products is less than our expectations or if we otherwise fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of components could result in inventory levels that could also lead to significant excess and obsolete inventory charges and affect our operating and financial results. 
 6 

Deterioration of, or instability in, the domestic and international economy and challenging end-market conditions could impact our ability to grow the business and adversely impact our ability to execute our strategy, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our businesses and operating results have been, and will continue to be, affected by domestic and international economic conditions. The level of demand for our products is affected by general economic and business conditions in our served end markets. A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from customers in cyclical industries (such as the industrial and oil gas sectors) that typically are adversely affected in periods of economic contraction or volatility. In such periods, our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, which may reduce or delay our sales. We have experienced contraction and challenging demand conditions in many of our served markets historically, and it is reasonably possible that we could experience such conditions in the future which may adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Disruptions in global oil markets have adversely affected our business and results of operations and similar events in the future may adversely affect our business and results. 
 A portion of our revenues is derived from customers in the midstream and downstream oil gas industry. Disruptions in the global oil gas markets (such as those due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine/Russia conflict and the resulting international sanctions) and other changes in demand for oil can negatively affect oil prices and negatively affect cash flows for many of those customers. This has resulted in, and in the future could result in, lower capital expenditures and project modifications, delays or cancellations by those customers, reducing the demand for certain of our products serving that end market, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Uncertainty over global tariffs, or the financial impact of tariffs, may negatively affect our results. 
 Changes in U.S. domestic and global tariff frameworks have increased our costs of producing goods and resulted in additional risks to our supply chain. We have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate previously implemented and, in some cases, proposed tariff increases, but there is no assurance we will be able to continue to mitigate prolonged tariffs. Further, uncertainties about future tariff changes could result in mitigation actions that prove to be ineffective or detrimental to our business. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Operations 
 We may not be able to fully realize expected cost savings from our ASCEND transformation program and from restructuring actions. 
 On March 23, 2022, we announced the launch of ASCEND, a transformation program focused on driving accelerated earnings growth and efficiency across the business with the goal of delivering improved annual operating profit once fully implemented. The ASCEND program has focused on the following key initiatives: (i) accelerating organic growth strategies, (ii) improving operational excellence and production efficiency by utilizing a lean approach and (iii) driving greater efficiency and productivity in selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, from time to time, we implement other plans that incur restructuring costs to (i) eliminate redundancies in our corporate or regional structures (ii) eliminate excess capacity in our facilities as a result of integration of acquisitions or divestitures of product lines, or (iii) eliminate product or service lines that do not meet targeted profitability metrics. Although we expect that the improved operating profit, cost savings and realization of efficiencies will offset the related costs of these initiatives and provide additional annual benefit, we may not fully achieve the expected benefits of these efforts (see Note 4, "Restructuring Charges," Note 3. "ASCEND Transformation Program" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and "Business Update" within Item 7 for further discussion of the ASCEND program and other current restructuring activities). 
 Logistics challenges, including global freight capacity shortages, could increase our freight costs or cause delays in our ability to fulfill orders and could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results. 
 The Company s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by shortages of freight capacity, delays at ports, port strikes, and other issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher freight and logistics costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company s business and financial condition. 
 7 

Collection risk for receivables in foreign jurisdictions. 
 We sell products and services through distributors and agents. In certain jurisdictions, those third parties represent a significant portion of our sales in their respective country. Collection times for receivables in many foreign jurisdictions may often be substantially longer than those in the United States (though less than one year). Further, for certain of our services business agency relationships, we utilize intermediary agents and are dependent on our agents to collect payment on our behalf. The indirect sales channels expose us to the credit risk of both our channel partners and end customers and increase the risk of delayed payments or uncollectible balances. A liquidity event or dispute involving one of these channel partners may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition . 
 If we fail to retain the agents and distributors upon whom we rely to market our products and services, we may be unable to effectively market our products and services and our revenue and profitability may decline. 
 The marketing success of many of our businesses in the U.S. and abroad depends largely upon our independent agents and distributors sales and service expertise and relationships with customers in our end markets. Many of these agents have developed strong ties to existing and potential customers because of their detailed knowledge of our products. A loss of a significant number of these agents or distributors, or of a particular agent or distributor in a key market or with key customer relationships, could significantly inhibit our ability to effectively market our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, operations, products, solutions, services and data. 
 Increased global cybersecurity threats, computer viruses and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks, as well as cybersecurity failures re sulting from human error, vulnerabilities and technological errors pose a risk to our systems, including third-party vendor operated systems, operations and products and potentially those of our business partners. An attack also could result in losses due to ransomware payments, security breaches, theft, lost or corrupted data, misappropriation of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, loss of trade secrets and commercially valuable information, production downtimes and operational disruptions. We attempt to mitigate these risks by employing measures including employee training, network monitoring and testing, maintenance of protective systems, contingency planning, and the engagement of third-party experts but we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. There is no assurance the financial or operational impact from such threats will not be material. 
 A material disruption at a significant manufacturing facility could adversely affect our ability to generate sales and result in increased costs that we cannot recover. 
 Our financial performance could be adversely affected due to our inability to meet customer demand for our products or services in the event of a material disruption at one of our significant manufacturing or services facilities. Equipment failures, natural disasters, health issues (including pandemics like COVID-19), power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, adverse weather conditions, labor disputes or other influences could create a material disruption. Interruptions to production could increase our cost of sales, harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain our customers. Our business continuity plans may not be sufficient to address disruptions attributable to such risks. Any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our business operates in highly competitive markets, so we may be forced to cut prices or incur additional costs. 
 Our business generally faces substantial competition, domestically and internationally, in our end markets. We may lose market share in certain businesses or be forced to reduce prices or incur increased costs to maintain existing business. We compete globally on the basis of product design, quality, availability, performance and customer service. Present or future competitors in our markets may have new technologies or more attractive products and services or greater financial, technical or other resources which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins to compete with us. 
 Our international operations pose political, currency and other risks. 
 We expect sales from and into foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the United States, including China, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Our sales and operating activities outside of the U.S. are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks, including: 
 unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; 
 adverse changes in foreign tax, legal and regulatory requirements; 
 export and import restrictions and controls on repatriation of cash; 
 8 

political and economic instability; 
 difficulty in protecting intellectual property; 
 government embargoes, tariffs and trade protection measures, such as anti-dumping duties applicable to classes of products, and import or export licensing requirements, as well as the imposition of trade sanctions against a class of products imported from or sold and exported to, or the loss of normal trade relations status with, countries in which we conduct business, that could significantly increase our cost of products or otherwise reduce our sales and harm our business; 
 cultural norms and expectations that may sometimes be inconsistent with our Code of Conduct and our requirements about the manner in which our employees, agents and distributors conduct business; 
 differing labor regulations; and 
 acts of hostility, terror or war. 
 Our operations outside the United States require us to comply with a number of United States and international regulations. For example, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA ), which prohibits United States companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity, or obtain any unfair advantage. Our activities in countries outside the United States create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of the FCPA, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. We have internal control policies and procedures and have implemented training and compliance programs with respect to the FCPA. However, we cannot assure that our policies, procedures and programs always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances. In addition, we are subject to and must comply with all applicable export controls and economic sanctions laws and embargoes imposed by the United States and other various governments. Changes in export control or trade sanctions laws may restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities, and may result in modifications to compliance programs and increase compliance costs, and violations of these laws or regulations may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions, such as loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business or debarments from export privileges. Violations of the FCPA or export controls or sanctions laws and regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 We intend to continue to pursue international growth opportunities, which could increase our exposure to risks associated with international sales and operations. As we expand our international operations, we may also encounter new risks that could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Failure to properly manage these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, United States tax reform has significantly changed how foreign operations are taxed in the United States. Therefore, we continue to review our organizational structure, and changes to where income is generated, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations. 
 Our customers and other business partners often require terms and conditions that expose us to significant risks and liabilities. 
 We operate in end markets and industries in which our customers and business partners seek to contractually shift significant risks associated with their operations or projects to us. We structure our commercial and contracting practices to assess and manage the risks we are assuming, but we cannot assure that material liabilities will not arise from our contracts with our business partners. Also, our contracting standards may be more stringent than those of certain competitors, and as a result, we may experience market share losses or the reduction in growth opportunities. 
 Imposition of climate-related laws and regulations that disadvantage the oil gas industry compared to other industries or consumer behavior that reduces demand for petroleum products may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 A significant portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of products and services to end users in the oil gas industry. Accordingly, our results of operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of climate-related laws and regulations that disadvantage the oil gas industry compared to other industries and have the effect of reducing the production of petroleum products. In addition, a reduction in the production of petroleum products as a result of consumer behavior that embraces alternative sources of energy over oil gas could similarly adversely affect our results of operations by reducing the demand for our products and services.

Risks Related to the Execution of Our Strategy 
 If we fail to develop new products, or customers do not accept our new products, our business could be adversely affected. 
 Our ability to develop innovative new products can affect our competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. Difficulties or delays in research, development, production or commercialization of new products, or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies, may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. If we fail to make innovations, launch products with quality problems, experience development cost overruns, or the market does not accept our new products, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected. 
 Our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions, which we may not be able to consummate or successfully integrate. 
 We plan to make acquisitions to grow our business, enhance our global market position and broaden our industrial tools product offerings. Our ability to successfully execute acquisitions will be impacted by factors including the availability of financing on terms acceptable to us, the potential reduction of our ability or willingness to incur debt to fund acquisitions, the reluctance of target companies to sell in current markets, our ability to identify acquisition candidates that meet our valuation parameters and increased competition for acquisitions. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations also may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Although we expect to successfully integrate any acquired businesses, we may not achieve the desired net benefit in the timeframe planned. Failure to effectively execute our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate the acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. 
 We may not be able to realize planned benefits from acquired companies. 
 We may not be able to realize planned benefits from acquired companies. Achieving those benefits depends on the timely, efficient and successful execution of a number of post-acquisition events, including integrating the acquired business into the Company. Factors that could affect our ability to achieve these benefits include: 
 difficulties in integrating and managing personnel, financial reporting and other systems used by the acquired businesses; 
 the failure of acquired businesses to perform in accordance with our expectations; 
 failure to achieve anticipated synergies between our business units and the business units of acquired businesses; 
 the loss of customers of acquired businesses; 
 the loss of key managers and employees of acquired businesses; or 
 other material adverse events in the acquired businesses. 
 If acquired businesses do not operate as we anticipate, it could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements may result in unexpected liabilities. 
 Certain acquisition agreements from past acquisitions require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of each of their companies. In most of these agreements, the liability of the former owners is limited to specific warranties given in the agreement as well as in amount and duration. Certain former owners also may not be able to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We may be subject to the same risk with respect to future acquisitions as well. As a result of those limitations, we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position. 
 10 

Divestitures and discontinued operations could negatively impact our business, and retained liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial results. 
 In connection with the execution of our strategy to become a pure-play industrial tools and services company, we have completed several divestitures, including the divestiture of our former EC S segment. These divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business, including retained liabilities related to divested businesses, obligations to indemnify buyers against contingent liabilities and potential disputes with buyers. 
 If we do not realize the expected benefits of these divestitures or our post-completion liabilities and continuing obligations are substantial and exceed our expectations, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue and profits associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets. 
 Our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. As of August 31, 2023, goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 304 million, or 40 of our total assets. The goodwill results from acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. We assess annually, and more frequently if a triggering event occurs, whether there has been impairment in the value of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall below current levels, we could be required to recognize a non-cash charge to operating earnings to impair the related goodwill or other intangible assets. We recognized 1 million in impairment charges in fiscal 2022 related to the goodwill in our Cortland Industrial operating segment (Other Segment) (see Note 6, "Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and "Critical Accounting Estimates" for further discussion on goodwill, intangible asset and long-lived asset impairments). Any future goodwill or intangible asset impairments could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters 
 We are subject to many laws and regulations that may change in ways that are detrimental to our competitiveness or results. 
 Our businesses are subject to regulation under a broad range of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. Some of those laws and regulations may change in ways that will require us to modify our business practices and objectives in ways that adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations, including by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting our operations to escalating costs or prohibiting us from operating in certain jurisdictions. Examples of laws or regulations that may have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and growth strategies include tax law, export and import controls, anti-corruption law, competition law, data privacy regulations, currency controls and economic or political sanctions. In addition, changes in laws or regulations, for example, the proposed regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to climate-related disclosures, may significantly increase our costs, adversely affecting our results of operations. 
 Legal compliance risks could result in significant costs to our business or cause us to restrict current activities or curtail growth plans. 
 We directly or indirectly operate in industries, markets and jurisdictions in which we are exposed to compliance risks and that are subject to significant scrutiny by regulators, governmental authorities and other persons. We structure and strengthen our risk management and compliance programs to mitigate such risks and foster compliance with all applicable laws, but our practices may not be sufficient to eliminate these risks. The global and diverse nature of our operations, the complex and high-risk nature of some of our markets, our reliance on third-party agents and representatives to support sales and other business activities, and increasingly stringent laws and enforcement activities could result in violations of law, enforcement actions or private litigation resulting in significant defense and investigation costs, fines and penalties, and a broad range of remedial actions, including potential restrictions on our operations and other adverse changes to our business plans. See Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about compliance risks. 
 11 

Health, safety and environmental laws and regulations may result in additional costs. 
 We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing public and worker health and safety. Violations of these laws could result in significant harm and financial liabilities that could adversely affect our operating results and reputation. Pursuant to such laws, governmental authorities have required us to contribute to the cost of investigating or remediating certain matters at current or previously owned and operated sites. In addition, we have provided environmental indemnities for previously owned operations in connection with the sale of certain businesses and product lines. Liability as an owner or operator, or as an arranger for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances, can be joint and several and can be imposed without regard to fault. There is a risk that costs relating to these matters could be greater than what we currently expect or exceed our insurance coverage, or that additional remediation and compliance obligations could arise which require us to make material expenditures. More stringent environmental laws, unanticipated remediation requirements or the discovery of previously unknown conditions could materially harm our financial condition and operating results. We are also required to comply with environmental laws and regulations to maintain operating permits and licenses, some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time, for many of our businesses, and our business operations could be restricted if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require. 
 Unfavorable tax law changes may adversely affect result s. 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in tax law (including a potential increase in the U.S. federal income tax rate), the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, or changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets. 
 Costs and liabilities arising from legal proceedings could be material and adversely impact our financial results. 
 We are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings, including litigation asserting product liability and warranty claims. We maintain insurance and have established reserves for these matters as appropriate and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and practices. Insurance coverage, to the extent it is available, may not cover all losses arising from such contingencies. Also, estimating legal reserves or possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations, and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our current estimates and adversely affect our results of operations. We also expect that additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time, and we cannot predict the occurrence, magnitude and outcome of such additional matters. Moreover, we operate in jurisdictions where claims involving us may be adjudicated within legal systems that are less developed and less reliable than those of the U.S. or other more developed markets, and this can create additional uncertainty about the outcome of proceedings before courts or other governmental bodies in such markets. 
 Risks Related to Our Capital Structure 
 Our indebtedness could harm our operating flexibility and competitive position. 
 We have incurred, and may in the future incur, significant indebtedness in connection with acquisitions or other strategic growth initiatives. While at current debt levels we have significant flexibility on our financial debt covenants, should we incur additional indebtedness to fund acquisitions or other strategic growth initiatives, our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage. 
 Our ability to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance our indebtedness and satisfy our other debt and lease obligations will depend upon our future operating performance and credit market conditions, which could be adversely affected by factors beyond our control. In addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financings will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. 
 The financial and other covenants in our debt agreements may adversely affect us. 
 Our senior credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants. These covenants could limit our financial and operating flexibility as well as our ability to plan for and react to market conditions, meet our capital needs and support our strategic priorities and initiatives should we take on additional indebtedness for acquisition or other strategic objectives. Our failure to comply with these covenants also could result in events of default which, if not cured or waived, could require us to repay indebtedness before its due date, and we may not have the financial resources or otherwise be able to arrange alternative financing to do so. Our compliance with the covenants of our senior credit facility may be adversely affected by severe market contractions or disruptions to the extent they reduce our earnings for a prolonged period and we are not able to reduce our debt levels or cost structure accordingly. Borrowings under our senior credit facility are secured by most domestic personal property assets and are guaranteed by most of our domestic subsidiaries and by a pledge of the stock of most of our domestic and certain foreign subsidiaries. If borrowings under our senior credit facility were declared or became due and payable immediately as the 
 12 

result of an event of default and we were unable to repay or refinance those borrowings, our lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets and stock. Any event that requires us to repay any of our debt before it is due could require us to borrow additional amounts at unfavorable borrowing terms, cause a significant reduction in our liquidity and impair our ability to pay amounts due on our indebtedness. Moreover, if we are required to repay any of our debt before it becomes due, we may be unable to borrow additional amounts or otherwise obtain the cash necessary to repay that debt, when due, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity. 
 We may incur increased interest expense as a result of our variable rate debt. 
 Borrowings under our revolving line of credit and our 200 million term loan incur interest which is variable based on fluctuations in the referenced SOFR ("Secured Overnight Financing Rate"). Increases in the referenced SOFR will increase our borrowing costs and negatively impact financial results and cash flows. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 The market price of our common stock may be volatile. 
 A relatively small number of shares are normally traded in any one day and higher volumes could have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks described in this section and elsewhere in this report or for reasons unrelated to our operations, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers, competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as industry conditions and general financial, economic and political instability. 
 Because our quarterly revenues and operating results may vary significantly in future periods, our stock price may fluctuate. 
 Our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to significant selling and manufacturing costs. Small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock may fall. Other factors that could significantly affect quarterly operating results include, but are not limited to: 
 demand for our products and services; 
 the timing of sales of our products and services; 
 changes in foreign currency exchange rates; 
 changes in applicable tax rates; 
 an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets; 
 the occurrence of restructuring charges; 
 unanticipated delays or problems in introducing new products; 
 announcements by competitors of new products, services or technological innovations; 
 changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors; 
 increased expenses, whether related to sales and marketing, raw materials or supplies, labor matters, product development or administration; 
 major changes in the level of economic activity in major regions of the world in which we do business; 
 costs related to possible future acquisitions or divestitures of technologies or businesses; 
 an increase in the number or magnitude of product liability or environmental claims; and 
 our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of our operations, particularly outside the U.S. 
 Various provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control. 
 The anti-takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Wisconsin corporation law could delay or prevent a change of control or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management. In particular, our articles of incorporation and bylaws, among other things: 
 require a supermajority shareholder vote to approve a merger of the Company with another entity; 
 regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholders meetings; and 
 authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without shareholder approval. 
 13 

General Risk Factors 
 Geopolitical unrest and terrorist activities may cause the economic conditions in the U.S. or abroad to deteriorate, which could harm our business. 
 Terrorist attacks against targets in the U.S. or abroad, rumors or threats of war, other geopolitical activity or trade disruptions, such as those caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the armed conflict involving Hamas and Israel, or any conflict or threatened conflict between China and Taiwan, may cause general economic conditions in the U.S. or abroad to deteriorate. The occurrence of any of these events could result in a prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the U.S. or in other areas and could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Our inability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse impact on our operations. 
 Our ability to deliver financial results and drive growth and pursue competitive advantages in our business substantially depends on our ability to retain key employees and continually attract new talent to the business. If we experience losses of key employees, such as our executives, or experience significant delays or difficulty in replacing them, our operations, competitive position and financial results may be adversely affected. Competition for highly qualified personnel is intense, and our competitors and other employers may attempt to hire our skilled and key employees. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience to operate our businesses successfully. From time to time there may be shortages of skilled labor which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees or lead to increased labor costs. 
 Our intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitors from developing products and services similar to or duplicative to ours, and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted by external dependencies. 
 Our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services functionally equivalent or superior to our own or adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our innovations and technology. In addition, further steps we take to protect our intellectual property, including non-disclosure agreements, may not prevent the misappropriation of our business critical secrets and information. In such circumstances, our competitive position and the value of our brand may be negatively impacted. 
 Our competitors or other persons could assert that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. 
 We may be the target of enforcement of patents or other intellectual property rights by third parties. We have implemented legal reviews and other controls in our new product development and marketing processes system to mitigate the risk of infringing third-party rights, but those controls may not prove adequate or deter all claims. Responding to infringement claims, regardless of their merits, can be expensive and time consuming. If we are found to infringe any third-party rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our current products and services.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis is intended to assist the reader in understandin g our results of operations and financial condition. Management s Discussion and Analysis is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ". 
 Background 
 The Company has one reportable segment, Industrial Tools Service ("IT S"), and an Other operating segment, which does not meet the criteria to be considered a reportable segment. The IT S segment is primarily engaged in the design, manufacture and distribution of branded hydraulic and mechanical tools, as well as providing services and tool rental to the industrial, maintenance, infrastructure, oil gas, alternative energy and other markets. Financial information related to the Company's reportable segment is included in Note 15, "Business Segment, Geographic and Customer Information" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Business Update 
 Our businesses provide an array of products and services across multiple markets and geographies which results in significant diversification. The IT S segment and the Company are well-positioned to drive shareholder value through a sustainable business strategy built on well-established brands, broad global distribution and end markets, clear focus on the core tools and services business and disciplined capital deployment. 
 Our Business Model 
 Our long-term goal is to create sustainable returns for our shareholders through above-market growth in our core business, expanding our margins, generating strong cash flow and being disciplined in the deployment of our capital. We intend to grow through execution of our organic growth strategy, focused on key vertical markets that benefit from long-term macro trends, driving customer driven innovation, expansion of our digital ecosystem to acquire and engage customers, and expansion in emerging markets such as Asia Pacific. In addition to organic growth, we also focus on margin expansion through operational efficiency techniques, including lean, continuous improvement and 80/20, to drive productivity and lower costs, as well as optimizing our selling, general and administrative expenses through consolidation and shared service implementation. We also apply these techniques and pricing actions to offset commodity increases and inflationary pricing. Finally, cash flow generation is critical to achieving our financial and long-term strategic objectives. We believe driving profitable growth and margin expansion will result in cash flow generation, which we seek to supplement through minimizing primary working capital. We intend to allocate the cash flow that results from the execution of our strategy in a disciplined way toward investment in our businesses, maintaining our strong balance sheet, disciplined M A and opportunistically returning capital to shareholders. We anticipate the compounding effect of reinvesting in our business will fuel further growth and profitable returns. 
 General Business Update 
 In March 2022, the Company announced the start of its ASCEND transformation program ASCEND ). ASCEND s key initiatives include accelerating organic growth strategies, improving operational excellence and production efficiency by utilizing a Lean approach, and driving greater efficiency and productivity in selling, general and administrative expense by better leveraging resources to create a more efficient and agile organization. In support of the ASCEND initiatives, we anticipate investing approximately 70- 75 million over the life of the program, which is expected to be fully implemented by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, with the expected annual operating profit improvement from the program in the range of 50- 60 million. Through the end of fiscal 2023, we invested approximately 60 million as part of the program, with operating profit improving by approximately 54 million in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year. 
 In June 2022, the Company approved a restructuring plan in connection with the initiatives identified as part of the ASCEND transformation program (see Note 3, ASCEND Transformation Program in the notes to the consolidated financial statements) to drive greater efficiency and productivity in global selling, general and administrative resources. The total costs of this plan were then estimated at 6 to 10 million, constituting predominately severance and other employee-related costs to be incurred as cash expenditures and impacting both IT S and Corporate. On September 23, 2022, the Company approved an updated restructuring plan. The costs of this updated plan (which includes the amounts for the plan approved in June 2022) are estimated at 10 to 15 million. These costs are expected to be incurred over the expected duration of the transformation program, ending in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2024, we expect to incur 10 to 15 million of ASCEND transformation program costs, this range is inclusive of 3 to 5 million of restructuring costs.

Commencing in February 2022, in response to the armed conflict in Ukraine, many countries, including the member countries of NATO initiated a variety of sanctions and export controls targeting Russia and associated entities. Approximately 1 of our historical annual sales are to customers and distributors associated with Russia and we had approximately 0.5 million of receivables associated with those customers and distributors as of February 28, 2022. The sanctions currently in place limit our ability to provide goods to those customers and distributors and banking sanctions effectively negate our ability to collect those receivables; as such, we recorded a full allowance for doubtful accounts against those receivables as of February 28, 2022 and indefinitely suspended doing business in Russia. We will continue to monitor the situation with Russia to assess when and if we are able to resume business with those customers and distributors, including collection of the outstanding receivables. We also continue to monitor and manage the ancillary impact of the Russia crisis on our business, which is primarily related to supply chain, increased commodity and energy costs, foreign exchange rate volatility and dealer confidence particularly in Europe. 
 During the year ended August 31, 2022, the Company recorded through bad debt expense (included in "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings) a reserve of 13 million to fully reserve for the outstanding accounts receivable balance for an agent in our Middle East/North Africa/Caspian ("MENAC") region. The allowance for doubtful accounts for this particular agent remains unchanged during fiscal 2023 and represents management's best estimate of the probable amount of collection and considers various factors with respect to this matter, including, but not limited to, (i) the lack of payment by the agent since the fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2021, (ii) our due diligence on balances due to the agent from its end customers related to sales of our services and products and the known markup on those sales from the agent to end customers, (iii) the status of ongoing negotiations with the agent to secure payments and (iv) legal recourse available to us to secure payment. Actual collections from the agent may differ from the Company's estimate. We have completely ceased our relationship with this agent and have transitioned to serving our regional customers through recently created direct operations within the region. 
 On October 31, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its former EC S segment to wholly owned subsidiaries of BRWS Parent LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners II, LP, for a purchase price of approximately 216 million (inclusive of final working capital adjustments), with approximately 3 million which was due in four equal quarterly installments, the last of which was received in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The EC S segment is treated as discontinued operations in our financial statements for all periods. 
 On July 11, 2023, the Company completed the sale of the Cortland Industrial business, for net proceeds of 20.1 million. The Company recorded a net gain of 6.2 million, see additional discussion in Note 5, "Discontinued Operations and Other Divestiture Activities" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

 Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022 
 C onsolidated net sales for fiscal 2023 were 598 million, 5 higher than the prior-year sales of 571 million. The impact of foreign currency rates unfavorably impacted fiscal 2023 sales by approximately 11 million or 2 and the divestiture of the Cortland Industrial business during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 unfavorably impacted sales by approximately 6 million or 1 , management refers to sales adjusted for these items as "core sales". Product sales growth was 8 with foreign currency and the divestiture of the Cortland Industrial business both unfavorably impacting sales by 9 million or 3 and 6 million or 1 , respectively. The product sales growth was primarily due to pricing actions, with some volume contribution. Service sales declined 8 , unfavorably impacted by 2 million or 1 of foreign currency and our reduced activity in the MENAC region following implementation of an 80/20 analysis that drove a more selective process for quoting projects, with a focus on more differentiated solutions. 
 Gross profit as a percentage of sales was approximately 49 in fiscal 2023, 3 higher than fiscal 2022. The increased gross profit is primarily attributed to the pricing actions, with some volume contribution noted above and production efficiencies implemented as part of the ASCEND transformation program partially offset by additional costs associated with the ASCEND transformation program. 
 Operating profit for fiscal 2023 was 84 million, approximately 53 million higher than the prior fiscal year of 31 million. Operating profit was impacted by the increased gross profit noted above, as well as a reduction of Selling, general administrative ("SG A") expense of 12 million compared to the prior year. The SG A decrease was primarily due to personnel savings from the actions taken in the ASCEND transformation program, as well as prior-year charges including MENAC agent specific reserve 13 million) and leadership transition charges 7 million), reduction of business review charges related to external support for the deep dive holistic business review 3 million). These reductions were partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense and expense from the ASCEND transformation program 21 million) compared to the prior year. Restructuring charges in fiscal 2023 decreased by 1 million to 7 million compared to fiscal 2022. Impairment and divestitures charges (benefit) improved by 9 million due to the gain on sale recorded from the Cortland Industrial divestiture in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 20 

Fiscal 2022 compared to Fiscal 2021 
 Consolidated net sales from continuing operations in fiscal 2022 were 571 million, 8 higher than the prior-year sales of 529 million. The impact from foreign currency rates unfavorably impacted sales by roughly 15 million or 3 . Sales growth was from product pricing actions that the Company took beginning in late fiscal 2021 and during fiscal 2022 in response to significant inflationary pressures on commodities, freight and energy costs coupled with year-over-year product volume growth largely in the first half of fiscal 2022, as prior year fiscal 2021 fir st half sales were still impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, were the primary drivers of the increase in net sales. 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2022 of 46 remained relatively flat with fiscal 2021, with improved gross profit margins on product sales primarily due to the aforementioned pricing actions outweighing the impact of inflation and improved productivity in our manufacturing facilities being offset by lower service gross profit margins due to lower service utilization as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the mix of service work performed year-over-year. 
 Operating profit was 20 million lower in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 predominantly due to 42 million of incremental SG A expenses offset by a 22 million increase in gross profit, as described above. The increase in SG A was due to ASCEND transformation program charges of 14 million related primarily to the use of external services for the support in the design, development and execution of the program; discrete bad debt charges of approximately 14 million associated with the significant delinquency in payments from a MENAC region agent and for Russian customers and distributors; incremental leadership transition charges of 8 million; charges of 3 million related to external support for the deep-dive holistic business review prior to the launch of the ASCEND program; and roughly 3 million of higher travel and entertainment costs tied to more commercial and leadership travel as we exited the COVID-19 pandemic. Restructuring charges increased 6 million as compared to the prior period as a result of charges to streamline and flatten the organizational structure 3 million), as well as ASCEND-related restructuring expenses 3 million). 
 Segment Results 
 IT S Segment 
 The IT S segment is a global supplier of branded hydraulic and mechanical tools and services to a broad array of end markets, including infrastructure, industrial maintenance, repair, and operations, oil gas, mining, alternative and renewable energy, and civil construction markets. Its primary products include branded tools, cylinders, pumps, hydraulic torque wrenches, highly engineered heavy lifting technology solutions and other tools (Product product line). The segment provides maintenance and manpower services to meet customer-specific needs and rental capabilities for certain of our products (Service Rental product line). The following table sets forth the results of operations for the IT S segment (dollars in millions): 
 Year Ended August 31, 2023 2022 2021 Net Sales 555 527 493 Operating Profit 136 79 82 Operating Profit 24.5 14.9 16.6 
 Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022 
 Fiscal 2023 net sales were 555 million, an increase of 5 or 28 million from fiscal 2022 sales of 527 million, with foreign currency rates unfavorably impacting sales by approximately 11 million or 3 . The increase in sales was predominately driven by growth in the product business primarily due to pricing actions, with some volume contribution, which were partially offset by the decline in the service business due to the implementation of 80/20 analysis and a more selective process for quoting projects in the MENAC region, with a focus on more differentiated solutions in the MENAC region. 
 Fiscal 2023 operating profit increased 57 million to 136 million. This increase was driven by the aforementioned pricing actions, with some volume contribution and a reduction in SG A expenses. The reduction of SG A expense was a result of 13 million of discrete bad debt charges in fiscal 2022 from our MENAC agent and personnel savings from ASCEND actions, which were partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense and higher costs for the ASCEND transformation program in fiscal 2023. 
 Fiscal 2022 compared to Fiscal 2021 
 Fiscal 2022 IT S segment net sales increased by 34 million (7 from fiscal 2021 to 527 million , which included a 15 million or 3 unfavorable impact on sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in sales was predominantly attributable to the continued global market recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in incremental product volume growth largely in the first half of fiscal 2022 coupled with the impact from pricing actions taken in late fiscal 2021 and during fiscal 2022 due to the significant inflation affecting commodity, freight and energy costs. 
 21 

Fiscal 2022 operating profit decreased 3 million (4 from the prior year. The operating profit decrease was a result of a 14 million increase in SG A expense primarily due to discrete bad debt charges of approximately 14 million associated with the significant delinquency in payments from a MENAC region agent and for Russian customers and distributors offset by a 15 million increase in gross profit due to pricing actions outweighing the impact of inflation and improved productivity in our manufacturing facilities being offset by lower service gross profit margins due to lower service utilization as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the mix of service work performed year over year. 
 Corporate 
 Corporate consists of selling, general and administrative costs and expenses, including executive, legal, finance, human resources, and information technology, that are not allocated to the segments based on their nature. Corporate expenses were 63 million in fiscal 2023 which is 14 million higher than the fiscal 2022 expenses of 49 million. This increase was primarily from ASCEND transformation program expenses 15 million) and incentive compensation expense. Additional expense was offset by a decrease in leadership transition charges 7 million) and external support for the deep dive-holistic business review 3 million). 
 Corporate expenses were 49 million in fiscal 2022 compared to 20 million in fiscal 2021. The increase of 29 million is a result of th e ASCEND transformation program charges 13 million ), business review charges related to external support for the deep dive-holistic business review prior to the launch of ASCEND 3 million ), leadership transition board search charges 8 million and an increase in restructuring charges to streamline and flatten the corporate structure 1 million), as well as ASCEND-related restructuring expenses 1 million). 
 Net financing costs were 12 million, 4 million and 5 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in net financing costs in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 was due to the year-over-year increase in interest rates and debt mix during the year. The decrease in net financing costs in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was due to the year-over-year increase in interest income due to greater short-term investment of excess cash in fiscal 2022. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 The Company's income tax expense is impacted by a number of factors, including, among others, the amount of taxable earnings generated in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate, permanent items, state tax rates, changes in tax laws, acquisitions and divestitures and the ability to utilize various tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. Income tax expense also includes the impact of provision to tax return adjustments, changes in valuation allowances and reserve requirements for unrecognized tax benefits. Pre-tax earnings, income tax expense and effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the past three fiscal years were as follows (dollars in thousands): 
 Year Ended August 31, 2023 2022 2021 Earnings before income tax expense 68,898 23,992 43,975 Income tax expense 15,249 4,401 3,763 Effective income tax rate 22.1 18.3 8.6 
 The comparability of pre-tax earnings, income tax expense and the related effective income tax rates are impacted by impairment and other divestiture charges and benefits as well as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act CARES Act ), which was enacted on March 27, 2020. Fiscal 2023 results included a 6 million impairment and divestiture benefit, whereas fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 results included 2 million and 6 million of impairment and divestiture charges, respectively. A substantial portion of these charges (benefits) do not result in a tax expense or benefit. The fiscal 2023 tax provision included a tax benefit of 2 million related to global tax planning initiatives. The fiscal 2022 tax provision included a tax benefit of 3 million related to global tax planning initiatives resulting from certain prior-year business losses for which no benefits were previously recognized as compared to a 3 million and 4 million benefit in fiscal 2021 related to the lapse of statute of limitations on uncertain tax positions and the net operating loss carryback provision of the CARES Act, respectively. 
 Both the fiscal 2023 and prior-year income tax provisions were impacted by the mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with income tax rates different than the U.S. federal income tax rate and income tax benefits from global tax planning initiatives. The fiscal 2023 effective tax rate was 22.1 , which is higher than the fiscal 2022 effective tax rate of 18.3 primarily due to one-time benefits in fiscal 2022. The fiscal 2023 effective tax rate was slightly higher than the statutory 21 primarily as a result of state income taxes and taxes in foreign jurisdictions with rates higher than the U.S. which were partially offset by one-time tax benefits related to global tax planning initiatives that will not repeat in future periods due to certain tax attributes that are no longer available.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 At August 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were 154 million, comprised of 148 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries and 6 million held domestically. The following table summarizes the cash flow attributable to operating, investing and financing activities (in millions): 
 Year Ended August 31, 2023 2022 2021 Cash provided by operating activities 78 52 54 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 11 (7) 13 Cash used in financing activities (53) (52) (82) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2) (12) 2 Net increase (decrease) from cash and cash equivalents 34 (20) (12) 
 Cash flow provided by operations was 78 million for fiscal 2023 and 52 million for fiscal 2022. The 26 million increase in cash flow from operations was primarily the result of 34 million of higher earnings from continuing operations offset by increases in incentive compensation of 10 million. We had approximately 11 million of cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations due to the proceeds from the sale of the Cortland Industrial business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 (see Note 5, "Discontinued Operations and Other Divestiture Activities" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the divestiture), as year-over-year cash used for investing in capital expenditures was nearly flat. Cash used in financing activities was 53 million, nearly flat to prior year use of 52 million; however the mix of usage in each fiscal year was different. In fiscal 2023 we entered into a new debt agreement (see Note 7, "Debt" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the senior credit facility) resulting in a change of debt mix with the repayment of our outstanding revolver and proceeds received from the issuance of a term loan. In fiscal 2023 we had lower treasury share purchases than the prior year. During fiscal 2023 we paid 1 million on our term loan. 
 Cash flow provided by operations was 52 million and 54 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease of 2 million in cash flow provided by operations was the result of 19 million lower net earnings from continuing operations offset by approximately 14 million of incremental receivable reserves to reconcile net earnings from continuing operations to net cash provided by operating activities. We used 7 million of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2022 as compared to 13 million cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2021. The cash used in fiscal 2022 was primarily used for capital expenditures. The cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2021 was largely generated due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of our manufacturing facility in China 22 million) and the death benefit for life insurance on legacy officers of the Company 3 million), offset by approximately 12 million of capital expenditures. In fiscal 2022, our cash used in financing activities was primarily from the purchase of treasury shares of 75 million and the paydown of principal on our revolving credit facility of 60 million partially offset by the borrowing on the revolving credit facility of 85 million. The cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 was primarily for the paydown of 90 million of principal on our outstanding credit facility with cash provided by operating activities and excess cash on hand. 
 During fiscal 2023, the Company refinanced its credit facility resulting in an updated senior credit facility (the "Senior Credit Facility") of 600 million, comprised of a 400 million revolving line of credit and a 200 million term loan, which will mature in September 2027. Prior to this, the Company's senior credit facility was comprised of a 400 million revolving line of credit and a 200 million term loan which were scheduled to mature in March 2024. The Senior Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants and financial covenants see Note 7, "Debt" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the Senior Credit Facility. The Company was in compliance with all covenants, including the financial covenants, under the Senior Credit facility at August 31, 2023. The unused credit line and amount available for borrowing under the revolving line of credit of the Senior Credit Facility was 382 million at August 31, 2023. 
 23 

We believe that the revolving credit facility under the Senior Credit Facility, combined with our existing cash on hand and anticipated operating cash flows, will be adequate to meet operating, debt service, acquisition and capital expenditure funding requirements for the foreseeable future. 
 Primary Working Capital Management 
 We use primary working capital as a percentage of sales as a key metric for working capital efficiency. We define this metric as the sum of net accounts receivable and net inventory less accounts payable, divided by the past three months' sales annualized. The following table shows the components of our primary working capital (dollars in millions): 
 August 31, 2023 August 31, 2022 PWC PWC Accounts receivable, net 98 15 107 18 Inventory, net 75 12 84 13 Accounts payable (51) (8) (73) (11) Net primary working capital 122 19 118 20 
 Total primary working capital was 122 million at August 31, 2023, which increased from 118 million at August 31, 2022. The primary working capital increase related to decreased accounts receivable from increased collections during fiscal 2023 and due to 9 million of lower inventory as we continue to work through SKU rationalization. This decrease as well as payment s related to our ASCEND transformation program was the driver of the 22 million decrease in accounts payable as of August 31, 2023 compared to August 31, 2022 . 
 Capital Expenditures 
 The majority of our manufacturing activities consist of assembly operations. We believe that our capital expenditure requirements are not as extensive as other industrial companies given the nature of our operations. Capital expenditures associated with continuing operations were 9 million, 8 million and 12 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 Given our desire to allocate cash flow and revolver availability to fund growth initiatives, we have historically leased most of our facilities and some operating equipment. We lease certain facilities, computers, equipment and vehicles under various operating lease agreements, generally over periods ranging from one to twenty years. Under most arrangements, we pay the property taxes, insurance, maintenance and expenses related to the leased property. Many of our leases include provisions that enable us to renew the leases at contractually agreed rates or, less commonly, based upon market rental rates on the date of expiration of the initial leases. 
 We had outstanding letters of credit totaling 9 million and 11 million at August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the majority of which relate to commercial contracts and self-insured workers' compensation programs. 
 Additional detail regarding contingencies is included in Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Our predominant sources of contractual obligations include the payment of interest and principal on our outstanding line of credit, our operating lease portfolio, certain employee-related benefit plans and agreements with certain suppliers related to the procurement of inventory. 
 The timing of principal payments associated with our revolving line of credit are disclosed in Note 7, "Debt" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We pay interest monthly based on prevailing interest rates at the time and the balance outstanding on our revolving line of credit. 
 Our lease contracts are primarily for real estate leases, vehicle leases, IT and manufacturing leases, information technology services and telecommunications services. See Note 10, "Leases" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for future minimum lease payments associated with our lease portfolio. 
 We have long-term obligations related to our deferred compensation, pension and postretirement plans that are summarized in Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 As part of our global sourcing strategy, we have entered into agreements with certain suppliers that require the supplier to maintain minimum levels of inventory to support certain products for which we require a short lead time to fulfill customer orders. We have the ability to notify the supplier that they no longer need to maintain the minimum level of inventory should we discontinue manufacturing a product during the contract period; however, we must purchase the remaining minimum 
 24 

inventory levels the supplier was required to maintain within a defined period of time. These contracts allow for us to terminate with appropriate notice so long as we utilize the remaining inventory on hand at the supplier and there are no overall minimum volumes in these contracts other than what the supplier is required to maintain on hand at any given point in time. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP. This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following estimates are considered by management to be the most critical in understanding judgments involved in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow. 
 Accounts receivable, net: Accounts receivable, net is recorded based on the contractual value of our accounts receivable, net of an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts representing management s best estimate of the amount of receivables that are not probable of collection. Accounts receivable, net was 98 million as of August 31, 2023 , which is net of a 17 million allowance for doubtful accounts. Our customer base generally consists of financially reputable distributors, agents, OEMs, and other customers with whom we have long standing relationships, and historically we have not experienced significant write off of accounts receivables as a percentage of our annual net sales (accounts receivable written off as a percentage of net sales was less than 0.5 for each the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectivel y). As of August 31, 2023, the Company was exposed to a concentration of credit risk with an agent as a result of its continued payment delinquency. During the year ended August 31, 2022, the Company recorded through bad debt expense (included in SG A expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings) a reserve of 13 million for this agent based on the consideration of the factors listed below, which fully reserves for this agent's outstanding account receivable balance. The allowance for doubtful accounts for this particular agent remained unchanged as of August 31, 2023 and continues to represent management's best estimate of the amount probable of collection and considers various factors with respect to this matter, including, but not limited to, (i) the lack of payment by the agent since the fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2021, (ii) our due diligence on balances due to the agent from its end customers related to sales of our services and products and the known markup on those sales from the agent to end customer, (iii) the status of ongoing negotiations with the agent to secure payments and (iv) legal recourse available to secure payment. Actual collections from the agent may differ from the Company's estimate. 
 Inventories: Inventory cost is determined using the last-in, first-out LIFO method for a portion of U.S. owned inventory (approximately 48 and 52 of total inventories at August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively). If the LIFO method were not used, inventory balances would be higher than amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet by 18 million and 19 million at August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We perform an analysis on historical sales usage of individual inventory items on hand and record a reserve to adjust inventory cost to net realizable value, if necessary. The inventory valuation assumptions used are based on historical experience. We believe that such estimates are made based on consistent and appropriate methods; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Goodw ill and Indefinite-lived intangibles: 
 Goodwill Impairment Review and Estimates: A considerable amount of management judgment is required in performing the impairment tests, principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we believe our judgments and ass umptions are reasonable, different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and, therefore, impairment charges could be required. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to the Company's business, loss of significant customers, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations and ultimately result in future impairment charges. 
 In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we generally use a discounted cash flow model, which calculates fair value as the sum of the projected discounted cash flows over a discrete six-year period plus an estimated terminal value. Significant assumptions include forecasted revenues, operating profit margins, and discount rates applied to the future cash flows based on the respective reporting unit's estimated weighted average cost of capital. In certain circumstances, we also may review a market approach in which a trading multiple is applied to either forecasted EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) or anticipated proceeds of the reporting unit to arrive at the estimated fair value. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded. The estimated fair value represents the amount we believe a reporting unit could be bought or sold for in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms-length basis. 
 Fiscal 2023 Impairment Charges : The fiscal 2023 annual review of reporting units performed in the fourth quarter did not result in an impairment. All reporting units exceeded the carrying value by more than 65 . 
 Fiscal 2022 Impairment Charges : In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we recorded a 1 million goodwill impairment charge associated with the Cortland Industrial reporting unit. All other reporting units exceeded the carrying value by more than 60 . 
 25 

Indefinite-lived intangibles (tradenames): Indefinite-lived intangible assets are also subject to annual impairment testing. On an annual basis or more frequently if a triggering event occurs, the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, based on a relief of royalty valuation approach, are evaluated to determine if an impairment charge is required. 
 No impairment was recorded in fiscal 2023 and no material impairment was recorded in fiscal 2022 as a result of triggering events or the annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
 A considerable amount of management judgment is required in performing impairment tests, principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable, different assumptions, could change the estimated fair values and, therefore, future additional impairment charges could be required. Prolonged weakening industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, loss of significant customers, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets or in entity structure and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations and ultimately result in future impairment charges. 
 Business Combinations and Purchase Accounting: Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill. Assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values and the values of assets in use, and often requires the application of judgment regarding estimates and assumptions. While the ultimate responsibility resides with management, for certain acquisitions we retain the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including intangible assets and tangible long-lived assets. Acquired intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are valued using discounted cash flow methodology based on future cash flows specific to the type of intangible asset purchased. This methodology incorporates various estimates and assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, profit margins and forecasted cash flows based on discount rates and terminal growth rates. 
 Defined Benefit Plans: We provide a variety of benefits to employees and former employees including, in some cases, pensions and postretirement health care. Plan assets and obligations are recorded based on an August 31 measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates. We determine the discount rate assumptions by referencing high-quality, long-term bond rates that are matched to the duration of our benefit obligations, with appropriate consideration of local market factors, participant demographics and benefit payment forecasts. At August 31, 2023 and 2022, the discount rates on domestic benefit plans were 5.4 and 4.8 , respectively. In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider historical returns, forward-looking considerations, inflation assumptions and the asset-allocation strategy in investing such assets. Domestic benefit plan assets consist primarily of participating units in mutual funds with equity based strategies, mutual funds with fixed income based strategies, and U.S treasury securities. The expected return on domestic benefit plan assets was 5.7 and 5.45 for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. A 25 basis point change in the assumptions for the discount rate or expected return on plan assets would not have materially changed the fiscal 2023 domestic benefit plan expense. 
 We review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications based on current rates and trends, when appropriate. As required by US GAAP, the effects of any modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods. Based on information provided by independent actuaries and other relevant sources, we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. See Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 
 Income Taxes: J udgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets. Our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and other adjustments. Our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of discrete income tax matters including adjustments to reserves for uncertain tax positions and the benefits of various income tax planning activities. Tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than these same items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, the effective income tax rate in our consolidated financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not tax deductible, while others are temporary differences, such as amortization and depreciation expenses. 
 Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not large enough to utilize the entire deduction or credit. Relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The diverse nature of our business activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks, including those related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity costs. 
 Interest Rate Risk As of August 31, 2023, long term debt consisted of million of borrowings under the revolving line of credit (variable rate debt) and million of term loan debt bearing interest on SOFR (variable rate). An interest-rate swap effectively converts the SOFR-based rate of million of term borrowings under our credit facility to a fixed rate. A ten percent increase in the average costs of our variable rate debt would have resulted in a 1 million increase in financing costs for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023 . 
 Foreign Currency Risk We maintain operations in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Our more significant non-U.S. operations are located in Australia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates and China, and we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Under certain conditions, we enter into hedging transactions (primarily foreign currency exchange contracts) that enable us to mitigate the potential adverse impact of foreign currency exchange rate risk (see Note 9, Derivatives in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information). We do not engage in trading or other speculative activities with these transactions, as established policies require th at these hedging transactions relate to specific currency exposures. 
 The strengthening of the U.S. dollar can have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations and financial position as foreign denominated operating results are translated into U.S. dollars. To illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the translation of our results of operations, annual sales and operating profit were remeasured assuming a ten percent reduction in foreign exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. Under this assumption, annual sales would have been 26 million lower and operating profit would have been 2 million lower for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023. This sensitivity analysis assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar and excludes the potential effects that changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have on actual sales or price levels. Similarly, a ten percent decline in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar on our August 31, 2023 financial position would result in a 38 million reduction to equity (accumulated other comprehensive loss), as a result of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities being translated into U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. 
 C ommodity Risk We source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers. While such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers, commodity raw materials, such as steel and plastic resin are subject to price fluctuations which could have a negative impact on our results. We strive to timely pass along such commodity price increases to customers to avoid profit margin erosion.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Enerpac Tool Group Corp. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Enerpac Tool Group and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive statement of income (loss), shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at August 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 20, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

Valuation of Goodwill within the IT S Segment 
 Description of 
 the Matter 
 At August 31, 2023, the Company s consolidated goodwill balance was 266.5 million. Goodwill associated with the IT S segment was 255.3 million. As disclosed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Management tests goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. In estimating fair value, management utilizes a discounted cash flow model, which is dependent on a number of assumptions, most significantly forecasted revenues and operating profit margins, and the weighted average cost of capital. 
 
 Auditing management s goodwill impairment test within the IT S segment was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of certain reporting units. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions over forecasted revenues, operating profit margins, and the weighted average cost of capital. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s goodwill impairment review process, including controls over management's review of the significant assumptions used to develop the fair value estimates and controls over the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the valuation. 
 
 To test the estimated fair value of the Company s reporting units within the IT S segment, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We also involved our valuation specialists to review certain significant assumptions. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends. We assessed the historical accuracy of management s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions. We reconciled the fair value of the reporting units in the IT S segment to their carrying value and tested the Company s determination of the assets and liabilities used within the reporting units that are the basis for the carrying value. In addition, we tested management s reconciliation of the fair value of all the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company and assessed the adequacy of the Company s goodwill valuation disclosures.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Enerpac Tool Group Corp. 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited Enerpac Tool Group Corp. and Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).

 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of August 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index at Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated October 20, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 The nature of the Company s products is such that they generally have a very short production cycle. Consequently, the amount of work-in-process at any point in time is minimal. In addition, many parts or components are ultimately either sold individually or assembled with other parts making a distinction between raw materials and finished goods impractical to determine. Certain locations maintain and manage their inventories using a job cost system where the distinction of categories of inventory by state of completion is also not available. As a result of these factors, it is neither practical nor cost effective to segregate the amounts of raw materials, work-in-process or finished goods inventories at the respective balance sheet dates, as segregation would only be possible as the result of physical inventories which are taken at dates different from the balance sheet dates.

 As indicated in the "Concentration of Credit Risk" section below, as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company was exposed to a concentration of credit risk with an agent as a result of its continued payment delinquency. During the year ended August 31, 2022, the Company recorded through bad debt expense (included in "Selling, general and administrative expenses" ("SG A expenses") in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings) a reserve of million based on the consideration of the factors listed below, which fully reserves for the outstanding account receivable balance for this agent. The allowance for doubtful accounts for this particular agent as of August 31, 2023 represents management's best estimate of the amount probable of collection and considers various factors with respect to this matter, including, but not limited to, (i) the lack of payment by the agent since the fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2021, (ii) our due diligence on balances due to the agent from its end customers related to sales of our services and products and the known markup on those sales from the agent to end customer, (iii) the status of ongoing negotiations with the agent to secure payments and (iv) legal recourse available to secure payment. Actual collections from the agent may differ from the Company's estimate. 
 Concentration of Credit Risk: The Company sells products and services through distributors and agents. In certain jurisdictions, those third parties represent a significant portion of our sales in their respective country which can pose a concentration of credit risk if these larger distributors or agents are not timely in their payments. As of August 31, 2023 the Company was exposed to a concentration of credit risk as a result of the payment delinquency of one of our agents whose accounts receivable represent of the Company's outstanding accounts receivable. As of August 31, 2023, the Company has fully reserved for the amounts due from this agent. 
 Contract Assets: Contract assets relate to the Company s rights to consideration for work completed but not billed as of the reporting date on contracts with customers. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional. The Company has contract assets on contracts that are generally long-term and have revenues that are recognized over time. 
 Contract Liabilities: As of August 31, 2023, the Company had certain contracts where there were unsatisfied performance obligations and the Company had received cash consideration from customers before the performance obligations were satisfied . The majority of these contracts relate to long-term customer contracts (project durations of greater than three months) and are recognized over time. The Company estimates that the million will be recognized in net sales from satisfying those performance obligations within the next twelve months. 
 Timing of Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time: The Company evaluates when the customer obtains control of the product based on shipping terms, as control will transfer, depending upon such terms, at different points between the Company's manufacturing facility or warehouse and the customer s location. The Company considers control to have transferred upon shipment or delivery because (i) the Company has a present right to payment at that time; (ii) the legal title has been transferred to the customer; (iii) the Company has transferred physical possession of the product to the customer; and (iv) the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product. 
 Variable Consideration: The Company estimates whether it will be subject to variable consideration under the terms of the contract and includes its estimate of variable consideration in the transaction price based on the expected value method when it is deemed probable of being realized based on historical experience and trends. Types of variable consideration may include rebates, incentives and discounts, among others, which are recorded as a reduction to net sales at the time when control of a performance obligation is transferred to the customer. 
 Practical Expedients Exemptions: The Company elected to expense the incremental cost to obtaining a contract when the amortization period for such contracts would be one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of unperformed obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which it recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed.
