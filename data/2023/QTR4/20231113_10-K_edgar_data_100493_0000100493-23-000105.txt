 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 GENERAL 
 Tyson Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company, we, us, our, Tyson Foods or Tyson (NYSE: TSN) is one of the world s largest food companies and a recognized leader in protein. Founded in 1935 by John W. Tyson and grown under four generations of family leadership, the Company has a broad portfolio of products and brands including Tyson , Jimmy Dean , Hillshire Farm , Ball Park , Wright , Aidells , ibp and State Fair . The Company s purpose is to raise the world s expectations for how much good food can do by winning with our team members, winning with customers and consumers and winning with execution. Headquartered in Springdale, Arkansas, the Company had approximately 139,000 employees team members on September 30, 2023. Through our Core Values, Tyson Foods is a company of people engaged in the production of food, seeking to pursue trust and integrity, and committed to creating value for our shareholders, our customers, our team members and our communities. We strive to be honorable and operate with integrity, be faith-friendly and inclusive, serve as stewards of the resources entrusted to us and provide a safe work environment. Some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products; the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace; accessibility of international markets; market prices for our products; the cost and availability of live cattle and hogs, raw materials and feed ingredients; availability of team members to operate our production facilities; and operating efficiencies of our facilities. 
 We operate a fully vertically-integrated chicken production process with the majority of our production in recent years certified as no antibiotics ever (sometimes referred to as "NAE"); however, during fiscal 2023, we began transitioning the majority of our production to no antibiotics important to human medicine (sometimes referred to as "NAIHM"). Our integrated operations consist of breeding stock, contract farmers, feed production, processing, further-processing, marketing and transportation of chicken and related specialty products, including animal and pet food ingredients. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cobb-Vantress, we are one of the leading poultry breeding stock suppliers in the world. Investing in breeding stock research and development allows us to breed into our flocks the characteristics found to be most desirable. 
 We also process live fed cattle and hogs and fabricate dressed beef and pork carcasses into primal and sub-primal meat cuts, case-ready beef and pork and fully-cooked meats. In addition, we derive value from specialty products such as hides and variety meats sold to further processors and others. 
 We produce a wide range of fresh, value-added, frozen and refrigerated food products. Our products are marketed and sold primarily by our sales staff to grocery retailers, grocery wholesalers, meat distributors, warehouse club stores, military commissaries, industrial food processing companies, chain restaurants or their distributors, live markets, international export companies and domestic distributors who serve restaurants, foodservice operations such as plant and school cafeterias, convenience stores, hospitals and other vendors. Additionally, sales to the military and a portion of sales to international markets are made through independent brokers and trading companies. 
 As part of our commitment to innovation and growth, we have a subsidiary focused on investing in companies developing breakthrough technologies, business models and products to sustainably feed a growing world population. Tyson New Ventures, LLC is used to broaden our exposure to innovative, new forms of protein and ways of sustainably producing food to complement the Company s continuing investments in innovation in our core Beef, Pork, Chicken and Prepared Foods businesses. 
 FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF SEGMENTS 
 We operate in four reportable segments: Beef, Pork, Chicken and Prepared Foods. We measure segment profit as operating income (loss). International/Other primarily includes our foreign operations in Australia, China, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, Thailand and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, third-party merger and integration costs and corporate overhead related to Tyson New Ventures, LLC. The contribution of each segment to net sales and operating income (loss), and the identifiable assets attributable to each segment, are set forth in Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 17: Segment Reporting. 
 DESCRIPTION OF SEGMENTS

Products are marketed domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant operators, hotel chains and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, convenience stores, healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to international export markets. 
 RAW MATERIALS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY 
 Beef 
 The primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle. We do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but employ cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit independent feed yards and public auctions to buy live cattle on the open spot market. These buyers are trained to select high quality animals, and we continually measure their performance. We also enter into various risk-sharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities. Although we generally expect adequate supply of live cattle in the regions we operate, there may be periods of imbalance in supply and demand. 
 Pork 
 The primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs. The majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers. We employ hog buyers who make purchase agreements of various time durations as well as purchase hogs on a daily basis, generally a few days before the animals are processed. These buyers are trained to select high quality animals, and we continually measure their performance. Additionally, we raise a small number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and to supply a minimal amount of market hogs and live swine for our own processing needs. Although we generally expect adequate supply of live hogs in the regions we operate, there may be periods of imbalance in supply and demand. 
 Chicken 
 The primary raw materials used in our domestic chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract farmers. Our vertically-integrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing. Breeder flocks (i.e., grandparents) are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced. Fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets (i.e., parents). Pullets are raised to 20 weeks of age, sent to breeder houses, and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries. Once chicks have hatched, they are sent to broiler farms. There, contract farmers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards, with advice from our technical service personnel, until the broilers reach the desired processing weight. Adult chickens are transported to processing facilities where they are harvested and converted into finished products, which are then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers. 
 We operate feed mills to produce scientifically-formulated feeds. In fiscal 2023, corn, soybean meal and other feed ingredients were major production costs, representing roughly 61 of our cost of growing a live chicken domestically. In addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens, we use cooking ingredients, packaging materials and cryogenic agents. We believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs, and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future. 
 While we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers, we also purchase ice-packed or deboned chicken to meet production and sales requirements.

Prepared Foods 
 The primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity-based raw materials, including beef, pork, chicken, turkey, flour, vegetables, cheese, eggs, seasonings and other cooking ingredients. Some of these raw materials are provided by our other segments, while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers. We believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs. 
 SEASONAL DEMAND 
 Demand for beef, chicken, pork and certain prepared foods products, such as hot dogs and smoked sausage, generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months. Other prepared foods products, such as prepared meals, meat dishes, appetizers, bacon, and breakfast sausage, generally experience increased demand during the winter months, primarily due to the holiday season, while demand generally decreases during the spring and summer months. 
 CUSTOMERS 
 Walmart Inc. accounted for of our fiscal 2023 consolidated sales. Sales to Walmart Inc. were included in all of our segments. Any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could, if not replaced, have a material impact on our operations. No other single customer or customer group represented more than 10 of fiscal 2023 consolidated sales. 
 COMPETITION 
 Our food products compete with those of other food producers and processors and certain prepared food manufacturers. Additionally, our food products compete in markets around the world. We seek to achieve a leading market position for our products via our principal marketing and competitive strategy, which includes: 
 identifying target markets for value-added products; 
 concentrating production, sales and marketing efforts to appeal to and enhance demand from those markets; and 
 utilizing our national distribution systems and customer support services. 
 Past efforts indicate customer demand can be increased and sustained through application of our marketing strategy, as supported by our distribution systems. The principal competitive elements are price, product safety and quality, brand identification, innovation, breadth and depth of product offerings, availability of products, customer service and credit terms. 
 FOREIGN OPERATIONS 
 We sold products in approximately 140 countries and regions in fiscal 2023. Major sales markets include Australia, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, the Middle East, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. We have the following foreign operations: 
 Cobb-Vantress, a chicken breeding stock subsidiary, has business interests in Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru, the Philippines, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. 
 Tyson Asia-Pacific consists of vertically-integrated chicken production operations in Thailand, multi-protein further-processing operations in Malaysia, a beef production operation in Australia, a producer and distributor of value-added and cooked chicken and beef products in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and joint venture interests in two non-consolidated poultry businesses in Malaysia and one in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
 Tyson China-Korea, with locations in China and South Korea, consists of vertically-integrated chicken production operations, multi-protein further-processing operations, and a joint venture interest in a non-consolidated chicken processing business. Tyson China also sells beef, pork, and chicken products imported from Tyson production facilities in the United States and other global operations. 
 Tyson Europe sells chicken products throughout the United Kingdom and Europe produced from our other global operations and co-packer arrangements and has a chicken further processing operation in the Netherlands. 
 Vibra Agroindustrial S.A., a joint venture in Brazil in which we have a minority interest, is a vertically-integrated chicken processing business. 
 Holding Agro Industrial S.A., a joint venture in Argentina and Uruguay in which we have a minority interest, is a vertically-integrated chicken processing business. 
 Godrej Tyson Foods, a joint venture in India in which we have a minority interest, is primarily a chicken processing business. 
 Tyson Mexico Trading Company, a Mexican subsidiary, sells chicken and prepared foods products primarily from our U.S. operations and co-packer arrangements. 
 We continue to evaluate growth opportunities in foreign locations. Additional information regarding export sales and long-lived assets located in foreign locations is set forth in Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 17: Segment Reporting.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 We conduct continuous research and development activities to improve product development, to automate manual processes in our processing facilities and grow-out operations, and to improve chicken breeding stock. Our Discovery Center in Springdale, Arkansas, includes more than 40,000 square feet of United States Department of Agriculture USDA and United States Food and Drug Administration FDA pilot plant space, consumer sensory and focus group areas, packaging labs and 19 research kitchens. The center enables us to bring new market-leading retail and foodservice products to the customer quickly and efficiently. Additionally, we have a Manufacturing Automation Center in Springdale, Arkansas, designed to grow the development of new manufacturing solutions and to enhance team member training on new technology. Further, we have research and development capabilities located in several international locations where we operate. 
 ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION AND FOOD SAFETY 
 Environmental Regulation 
 Our facilities for processing beef, pork, chicken, turkey and prepared foods, milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which include provisions relating to all environmental media - air, land and water, and generally provide for protection of the environment. 
 We believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations of such laws and regulations likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs. The cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and except as described below, is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future. 
 Food Safety 
 We work to ensure our products meet high standards of food safety and quality. In addition to our own internal Food Safety and Quality Assurance oversight and review, our beef, pork, chicken, and prepared foods products are subject to inspection, primarily by the USDA and the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA ). We also participate in the USDA s Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points HACCP program or FDA s Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Prevention Controls HARPC program as applicable and are subject to the Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures and the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. Additionally, our foreign operations are subject to various other food safety and quality assurance oversight and review. 
 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
 Various federal, state, regulatory agencies, and non-U.S. governments continue to consider and adopt programs to regulate, report, and control greenhouse gas emissions. Although we have not incurred significant costs or capital expenditures, due to continuing uncertainty surrounding this issue, it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would have on us and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect. 
 Tyson closely monitors developments in this area and strives to mitigate risks related to greenhouse gas emissions through sustainability initiatives. For example, we have voluntarily sets goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) criteria, including our ambition to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We continue to evaluate the plans and associated costs of achieving our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. 
 Sustainability 
 Through our Formula to Feed the Future, we aim to bring together a diverse set of expertise and the scalable resources needed to reimagine our people and community impact, drive product responsibility from farm to table, and work toward sustaining natural resources and achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. We are reimagining our people and community impact by enabling workers to succeed while supporting the growth of our communities. We aim to drive product responsibility from farm to table by delivering value to consumers with high-quality, sustainable, nutritious protein through our leading portfolio of products. Additionally, we are working toward sustaining natural resources and achieving net zero by driving practices in our own operations and supply chains to more sustainably produce protein for a growing population within planetary boundaries. 
 We were selected as a potential grant recipient in fiscal 2022 under the USDA's Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities grant program. With the help of the USDA grant, we plan to execute a five-year program that incentivizes farmer and rancher adoption of agricultural practices that have the potential to increase carbon sequestration and work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our supply chain and beyond. 
 We have also partnered with World Resources Institute to assess water risk and develop a water stewardship strategy, completed construction of Tyson Foods Center for Sustainable Broiler Research, and announced our global forest protection standard following deforestation risk assessment. Additionally, we established sustainability governance and oversight through the Governance and Nominating Committee of our Board of Directors. This Committee advises the Board on matters relating to corporate responsibility and sustainability, including environmental, social and governance matters affecting the Company. It also oversees the Company s key programs and oversees and reviews, at least annually, the Company s integration of sustainability principles into our business strategy and decision-making.

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
 Employees and Labor Relations 
 As of September 30, 2023, we employed approximately 139,000 team members globally. Approximately 120,000 team members were employed in the United States, of whom approximately 114,000 were employed at non-corporate sites such as production facilities, warehouses, truck shops, hatcheries and feed mills. Approximately 19,000 team members were employed in other countries, primarily in Thailand and China. For fiscal 2023, our domestic workforce experienced a 2 decrease in retention rate from fiscal 2022 primarily driven by macro trends associated with a challenging labor environment. Approximately 33,000 team members in the United States were subject to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions, with approximately 13 of those team members at locations either under negotiation for contract renewal or included under agreements expiring in fiscal 2024. The remaining agreements expire over the next several years. Approximately 6,000 team members in other countries were subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe our overall relations with our workforce in both unionized and non-union settings are healthy. 
 Health, Safety and Wellbeing 
 We maintain a safety culture grounded on the premise of eliminating workplace incidents, risks and identified hazards. To keep our team members safe, we focus on ensuring that all team members receive appropriate training and equipment. For example, every production facility team member completes at least 13 hours of compliance, safety and food safety training per year, and new hourly employees receive 120 hours of classroom and on-the-job orientation. We created and implemented processes to help identify and eliminate safety events by reducing their frequency and severity. We also review and monitor our safety performance closely. Our goal is to reduce Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA recordable incidents year over year. During fiscal 2023, our recordable incident rate declined 1 compared to fiscal 2022. As an expansion of our wellbeing culture and efforts to boost the overall health and wellness of our workforce, we continue to operate health clinics near our production facilities, giving team members and their families easier access to high-quality healthcare. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE I) 
 We believe that diversity, equity and inclusion DE I is our strength. Our Company is diverse and consists of team members with a variety of experiences, backgrounds, beliefs and lifestyles. Our workforce consists of approximately 39 women and over 60 minority groups. We strive to continue cultivating a culture and vision that supports DE I in every aspect of our business, from recruiting to individual development and team member engagement, with the objective of promoting and retaining talent. We also believe that having engaged team members with a sense of belonging is paramount to our continued success. The Company has eight employee-led business resource groups that support our team members and assist with efforts to build a culture of inclusion to ensure that everyone feels respected and valued. Some of our functional teams have also engaged formal DE I councils to inform special projects and initiatives and many production facilities routinely host local diversity committees. 
 Talent and Development 
 Our talent strategy and philosophy Grow With Us is focused on attracting the best talent, recognizing and rewarding performance, while continually developing, engaging and retaining our team members. We focus on the team member experience, removing barriers to engagement, further modernizing the human resources process, focusing on frontline team member retention and continually improving equity and effectiveness of all talent practices. Consistent with this focus, we conducted our fourth OneTyson engagement survey, that included corporate and frontline team members for the purpose of evaluating our team member experience, internal performance and how we compared to other companies in multiple areas. In addition, through our Upward Academy Onsite Program, we offer English as a second language, high-school equivalency, citizenship, financial literacy and digital literacy training to all team members. As of September 30, 2023, the onsite program was operating at 58 Company locations. To expand access to Upward Academy to all team members, we have also launched Upward Academy online, a frontline career development program. This program helps team members further hone professional skills and creates opportunities for our team members to advance to higher-paying, more senior-level positions within the Company through college degrees, job skills training and workforce certifications at no cost. We have a goal to be the most sought after company within our markets and peer groups. We strive to grow and develop the different capabilities and skills that we need for the future, while maintaining a robust pipeline of talent throughout the organization. 
 MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION 
 Our principal marketing objective is to be the preferred provider of beef, pork, chicken and prepared foods products for our customers and consumers. We build the Tyson , Jimmy Dean , Hillshire Farm , Ball Park , Wright , Aidells , ibp and State Fair brands while supporting strong regional and emerging brands primarily through distinctive brand and product advertising, promotion and public relations efforts focused toward key consumer targets with specific needs. We identify growth and business opportunities through consumer and customer insights derived via leading research and analytic capabilities. We utilize our national distribution system and customer support services to achieve the leading market position for our products and brands. 
 
 7 

We have the ability to produce and ship fresh, frozen and refrigerated products worldwide. Domestically, our distribution system extends to a broad network of food distributors and is supported by our owned or leased cold storage warehouses, public cold storage facilities and our transportation system. Our distribution centers accumulate fresh and frozen products so we can fill and consolidate partial-truckload orders into full truckloads, thereby decreasing shipping costs while increasing customer service. In addition, we provide our customers a wide selection of products that do not require large volume orders. Our distribution system enables us to supply large or small quantities of products to meet customer requirements anywhere in the continental United States. Internationally, we utilize both rail and truck refrigerated transportation to domestic ports, where consolidations take place to transport to foreign destinations. 
 PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS 
 We have filed a number of patent applications relating to our processes and products that either have been granted or are in the process of review. Because we do a significant amount of brand name and product line advertising to promote our products, we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our marketing efforts and we regularly register and apply for the registration of a number of trademarks. We also have developed non-public proprietary information regarding our production processes and other product-related matters.

 INDUSTRY PRACTICES 
 Our agreements with customers are generally short-term, primarily due to the nature of our products, industry practices and fluctuations in supply, demand and price for such products. In certain instances where we are selling further processed products to large customers, we may enter into written agreements whereby we will act as the exclusive or preferred supplier to the customer, with pricing terms that are either fixed or variable.

Risk Factors. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 These risks, which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 BUSINESS OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS 
 Global pandemics have had, and may in the future have, an adverse impact on our business and operations. 
 Our business relies on the health and wellbeing of our employees who run the day-to-day operations of the Company. Global pandemics, or localized epidemics, have had and may in the future have a significant adverse impact on our business and operations. Specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected many parts of our business and operations, and the sustained, continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (including indirect effects from the immediate impacts of the pandemic) remain difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of additional variants, the efficacy of vaccines against new variants and the speed at which normal economic and operating conditions can resume. 
 We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, an increase in operating costs in connection with higher costs associated with protecting the health and safety of team members. There can be no assurance that the health and safety measures we have taken with respect to new COVID-19 variants or widespread illnesses, should a new global pandemic occur, will eradicate the risks associated with working in a critical infrastructure industry, including but not limited to, infection of our employees or a temporary reduction in the operating capacity of a facility. Further, there can be no assurance that we will not incur additional direct incremental expenses related to new variants or widespread illnesses going forward, and that such amounts will not be material or have a material impact on our business, cash flows or results of operations. 
 If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, including because of illness, this could have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations. For example, certain of our team members who claim to have tested positive for COVID-19, or their family members, have filed lawsuits seeking compensatory and punitive damages for wrongful death and personal injury claims in several states, and additional team members or family members of team members may assert similar claims as new COVID-19 variants, other contagions or if a new global pandemic arises. If we are unsuccessful in defending against such claims, we may experience significant losses and expenses in connection with these lawsuits, which could adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 9 

We have also experienced, and expect to continue to experience, disruption and volatility in our supply chain, which has resulted, and may continue to result, in increased costs for certain raw materials, packaging materials and transportation costs. Any future disruptions within our supply chain from a global pandemic will depend on a variety of factors and circumstances that remain difficult to predict. Other supply chain risks associated with a global pandemic include but are not limited to shutdowns or reduced operations at our suppliers facilities, the continued inability of some of our contract producers to manage their livestock, supply chain disruptions for feed grains, changes in consumer orders due to shifting consumer patterns, changes in livestock and protein market prices, and additional disruptions in logistics or the distribution chain for our products, the occurrence of any of which have and may in the future result in a reduction in our fill rates to our customers. In addition, our operations, or those of independent contract poultry producers and producers who provide the live animals to our production operations, may become more limited in their ability to procure, deliver, or produce our food products because of labor shortages. 
 As a result of academic and in-restaurant dining shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, each of our segments previously experienced a shift in demand from foodservice to retail. While each of our segments has subsequently experienced varying levels of foodservice recovery, the long-term impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain and will depend on a number of future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, in the event of a protracted period of economic downturn either in the near term or as a result of a future global pandemic, demand for our foodservice products may remain below expectations or decrease further, and demand for our retail consumption products may also decrease, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 We also face other risks associated with or potentially originated from the COVID-19 pandemic, including: 
 additional increase in input cost may not be adequately captured through pricing; 
 adverse changes to the global economy may subject us to risk of material intangible and long-lived asset impairments, adjustments for inventory and market volatility for items subject to fair value measurements such as derivatives and investments; 
 an increase in working capital needs and/or an increase in trade accounts receivable write-offs (and associated reserves) as a result of increased financial pressures on our suppliers or customers who are not able to pay in a timely manner or at all; 
 a shift in consumer spending as a result of an economic downturn, which could result in consumers moving to private label or lower price products; and 
 litigation. 
 Actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to risks associated with COVID-19, or if in the event of a new global pandemic, are unknown and are impossible to predict with certainty. Nor can the Company predict whether or when a COVID-19 variant or widespread illness will or can disrupt our business in the future. Any such disruption could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 We may not realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of our financial excellence programs, which may prove to be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected. 
 The Company approved a restructuring program in fiscal 2022 (the 2022 Program to improve business performance, increase collaboration, enhance team member agility, enable faster decision-making and reduce redundancies. In conjunction with the 2022 Program, the Company relocated all of its corporate team members from its former Chicago, Downers Grove and Dakota Dunes area corporate locations to its world headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas. We anticipate the remaining workstreams of the 2022 Program and associated expenses will be complete in our fiscal 2025. For more information regarding this program, refer to Part II, Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7: Restructuring and Related Charges. Additionally, in fiscal 2022, we launched a new productivity program to drive a better, faster and more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision-making. 
 The success of the financial excellence programs, or future financial excellence programs, including the realization of the anticipated benefits, will depend in part on our ability to successfully implement the programs in an efficient and effective manner. The implementation of the financial excellence programs may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and the financial excellence programs may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits. If we are unable to implement the financial excellence programs smoothly or successfully, or we otherwise do not capture the anticipated savings, our business, results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be negatively impacted. 
 In addition, we may incur higher costs than anticipated and the program impacts could result in performance shortfalls. The financial excellence programs may become a distraction for our organization and may disrupt our ongoing business operations; cause deterioration in team member morale; disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations; and result in negative publicity which could affect our corporate reputation. If we are unable to successfully manage the negative consequences of the financial excellence programs, our business, results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be adversely affected. 
 
 10 

We are subject to risks associated with our international activities, which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign locations, as well as our operations and assets in such locations. 
 In fiscal 2023, we sold products to customers in approximately 140 countries. Major sales markets include Australia, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, the Middle East, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. Our sales to customers in foreign countries for fiscal 2023 totaled 7.9 billion, of which 5.1 billion related to export sales from the United States. In addition, we had approximately 1.4 billion of long-lived assets located in foreign locations, primarily Brazil, China, the European Union, New Zealand and Thailand, at the end of fiscal 2023. 
 As a result, we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including: 
 closing of borders by foreign countries to the import of beef, pork and poultry products due to animal disease or other perceived health or safety issues; 
 impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the United States dollar and foreign currencies, particularly the Australian dollar, the Brazilian real, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the European euro, the Malaysian ringgit, the Mexican peso, and the Thai baht; 
 political and economic conditions, including the ongoing conflicts between Ukraine and Russia, as well as political tension and conflict in the Middle East and elsewhere; 
 difficulties and costs to comply with, and enforcement of remedies under, a wide variety of complex domestic and international laws, treaties and regulations, including, without limitation, the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and economic and trade sanctions enforced by the United States Department of the Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control; 
 different regulatory structures and unexpected changes in regulatory environments; 
 tax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation; 
 potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; 
 distribution costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation; and 
 the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, including any resurgence and new or existing variants, on the global economy and on consumer demand worldwide; imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protection measures imposed by foreign countries regarding the importation of beef, pork, poultry and prepared foods products, in addition to import or export licensing requirements imposed by various foreign countries. 
 Negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results. 
 Our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information technology systems against, or effectively respond to, cyber attacks, other cyber incidents or security breaches or if our information technology systems are otherwise disrupted. 
 Information technology is an important part of our business operations, and we rely on information technology systems to manage business data and increase efficiencies in our production and distribution facilities and inventory management processes. We also use information technology to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. In addition, we depend on information technology for digital marketing and electronic communications between our facilities, personnel, customers and suppliers, including ordering and managing raw materials and inputs, receiving and processing purchase orders, shipping products to customers and processing other transactions. Communications between our facilities, personnel, customers and suppliers may include and is not limited to personal confidential information and payment card industry data, confidential and propriety intellectual property, trade secrets and other information and business and financial information. Like other companies, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of disruptions, including but not limited to the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, user errors, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber attacks, hackers, unauthorized access attempts and other security issues. In addition, such incidents could result in unauthorized or accidental disclosure of material confidential information or regulated individual personal data. 
 We have in the past experienced, and may in the future face, cyber attacks, other cyber incidents or security breaches, and there can be no assurance that we will always be able to sufficiently mitigate the impacts to our business and operations. We have implemented and continue to evaluate security initiatives and disaster recovery plans to mitigate our exposure to these risks, but these measures may not be adequate. Attempted cyber attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems or networks, are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. Therefore, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventive measures, and we may face delays in our detection or remediation of, or other responses to, security breaches and other security-related incidents or vulnerabilities. 
 
 11 

Any significant failure of our systems, including failures that prevent our systems from functioning as intended or our failure to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyber attacks or other cyber incidents, could cause transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of customers and sales, have negative consequences on our team members and our business partners, have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation and expose us to liability, litigation and regulatory enforcement actions. If there is wide scale disruption to our systems, we may need to shut parts or all of our systems down to run tests and repairs. Any such downtime could have significant impacts on our ability to continue our business operations, including our ability to operate our facilities, manage and track inventory, manage and track incoming new orders and statuses of existing orders, and to continue to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. In the event any significant failure of our systems requires us to upgrade or set up new systems, oversight and implementation of the new system and training personnel could be costly, there may be further disruptions from potential instability in the new system, and there may be heightened cybersecurity risks in connection with the migration of data to the new system. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our business partners, customers, consumers or suppliers. Finally, the disclosure of non-public information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image. Similar risks exist with respect to the third-party vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, including health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties and their vendors. We have not experienced any significant cyber-related events in the current fiscal year. 
 We may not be able to successfully consummate favorable strategic acquisitions or divestitures or successfully integrate acquired businesses. 
 We periodically evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures and other initiatives, and may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies, processing plants, technologies, products and services. Acquisitions and joint ventures involve financial and operational risks and uncertainties, including: 
 challenges in realizing the anticipated benefits of the transaction; 
 difficulty integrating acquired businesses, technologies, operations and personnel with our existing business; 
 diversion of management attention in connection with negotiating transactions and integrating the businesses acquired; 
 difficulty identifying suitable candidates; 
 consummating a transaction on terms that are favorable to us; 
 challenges in retaining the acquired businesses customers and key team members; 
 inability to implement and maintain consistent standards, controls, procedures and information systems; 
 exposure to unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities of acquired companies; and 
 the availability and terms of additional debt or equity financing for any transaction. 
 We may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units. If we are unable to do this, such expansion could adversely affect our financial results. Additionally, from time to time, we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets. We may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may affect our profitability and margins. Moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability. Our divestiture activities may present financial, managerial and operational risks. Those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems, possible need for providing transition services to buyers, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers. Any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Tyson Limited Partnership can exercise significant control. 
 As of September 30, 2023, Tyson Limited Partnership (the TLP owns 99.985 of the outstanding shares of the Company s Class B Common Stock, 0.10 par value Class B stock ), and the TLP and members of the Tyson family own, in the aggregate, 2.44 of the outstanding shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock, 0.10 par value Class A stock ), giving them, collectively, control of approximately 71.74 of the total voting power of the Company s outstanding voting stock. At this time, the TLP does not have a managing general partner, as such, the management rights of the managing general partner may be exercised by a majority of the percentage interests of the general partners. As of September 30, 2023, through a series of trusts, Mr. John Tyson, Chairman of the Board of Directors, controls 44.445 of the general partner percentage interests, and Ms. Barbara Tyson, a director of the Company, controls 11.115 of the general partner percentage interests (the remaining general partnership interests are held by the Donald J. Tyson Revocable Trust (44.44 )). As a result of these holdings, positions and directorships, the partners in the TLP have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders, including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, the election and removal of directors, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price. Additionally, as a result of the TLP s significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock, we are eligible for controlled company exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange.

INDUSTRY RISK FACTORS 
 Fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials, especially feed grains, live cattle, live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings. 
 Our results of operations and financial condition, as well as the selling prices for our products, are dependent upon the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials such as beef, pork, poultry, corn, soybean meal, packaging materials and energy and, to a lesser extent, cheese, fruit, seasoning blends, flour, corn syrup, corn oils, butter and sugar. Corn, soybean meal and other feed ingredients, for instance, represented roughly 61 of our cost of growing a live chicken in fiscal 2023. 
 Production and pricing of these commodities are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control. Such factors include, among other things, weather patterns throughout the world, outbreaks of disease, the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients, as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments. 
 Volatility in our commodity and raw material costs directly impact our gross margin and profitability. The Company s objective continues to be to offset commodity price increases with pricing actions over time. However, we may not always be able to increase our product prices enough to sufficiently offset increased raw material costs due to consumer price sensitivity or the pricing postures of our competitors. In addition, if we increase prices to offset higher costs, we could experience lower demand for our products and sales volumes. Conversely, decreases in our commodity and other input costs may create pressure on us to decrease our prices. While we use derivative financial instruments, primarily futures and options, to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodities prices. 
 Over time, if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs, to offset operating cost increases with continuous improvement savings or are not successful in our commodity hedging program, then commodity and raw material price increases could materially and adversely affect our profitability, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors. 
 The food industry in general is intensely competitive. We face competition from other food producers and processors that have various product ranges and geographic reach. Some of the factors on which we compete include: pricing, product safety and quality, brand identification, innovation, breadth and depth of product offerings, availability of our products (including distribution channels used, such as e-commerce) and competing products, customer service, and credit terms. 
 From time to time in response to these competitive pressures or to maintain market share, we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase or reallocate spending on marketing, advertising and promotions and new product innovation. Such pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to raw material and other cost increases. Any reduction in prices as a result of competitive pressures, or any failure to increase prices to offset cost increases, could harm our profit margins. If we reduce prices but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset the price changes, then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer. Alternatively, if we do not reduce our prices and our competitors seek advantage through pricing or promotional changes, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected. 
 Outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and the supply and demand for our products. 
 Supply of and demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases, including African swine fever ASF ), Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, Foot and Mouth Disease and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza HPAI ), which can have a significant impact on our financial results. In recent years, ASF has impacted hog herds in China, Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean, and if an outbreak of ASF were to occur in the United States, the Company s supply of hogs and pork could be materially impacted. HPAI was detected within the United States in 2022 and additional new cases have been recently confirmed in certain states. Efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary biosecurity measures designed to ensure the health of livestock. However, outbreaks of disease and other events, which may be beyond our control, either in our own livestock or livestock owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us, could significantly affect demand for our products, consumer perceptions of certain protein products, the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations. Moreover, the outbreak of livestock diseases, particularly in our Chicken segment, could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to, among other things, destroy any affected livestock. Furthermore, an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers, facilities or customers. This could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results. 
 Changes in consumer preference and failure to maintain favorable consumer perception of our brands and products could negatively impact our business. 
 The food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. Trends within the food industry change often, and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to, among other things, reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products. We strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, but we may not be successful in our efforts. 
 13 

We could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients, or the food safety system generally. Prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products or ingredients or loss of confidence in the food safety system generally could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. Continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. 
 Failure to continually innovate and successfully launch new products and maintain our brand image through marketing investment could adversely impact our operating results. 
 Our financial success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences, purchasing behaviors and dietary habits and successfully developing and launching new products and product extensions that consumers want in the channels where they shop. We devote significant resources to new product development and product extensions, however we may not be successful in developing innovative new products or our new products may not be commercially successful. To the extent we are not able to effectively gauge the direction of our key markets and successfully identify, develop, manufacture and market new or improved products in these changing markets, such as adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, our financial results and our competitive position will suffer. In addition, our introduction of new products or product extensions may generate litigation or other legal proceedings against us by competitors claiming infringement of their intellectual property or other rights, which could negatively impact our results of operations. 
 We also seek to maintain and extend the image of our brands through marketing investments, including advertising, consumer promotions and trade spend. Due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising, promotions and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits. Continuing global focus on health and wellness, including weight management, and increasing media attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of food marketing practices. 
 Our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image also depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. The growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our reputation and brand image. 
 We are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products, for instance marketing to children, which may limit our ability to maintain or extend our brand image. If we do not maintain or extend our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 The loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business. 
 Our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers plans and/or markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers, including, for example, Walmart Inc., which accounted for 18.6 of our sales in fiscal 2023. Our retail customers typically do not enter into written contracts, and if they do sign contracts, they generally are limited in scope and duration. There can be no assurance that significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past. Alternative retail channels, such as convenience stores, dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and Internet-based retailers have increased their market share. 
 
 14 

This trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future. If we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels, our business or financial results may be adversely impacted. Many of our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years, and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the United States and in other major markets. These consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories, opposing price increases, and demanding lower pricing, increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products. These customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products. Because of these trends, our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products. Additionally, these large customers may demand more favorable terms that may expose us to greater risks, including uncapped indemnification and no limitation of liability provisions. Such terms may obligate us to pay significant amounts in connection with potential losses arising from claims and related legal proceedings, and any such claims could also affect our reputation and our relationship with customers. We generally attempt to limit the maximum amount of indemnification or liability that we could be exposed to under our contracts, but this is not always possible without risking the loss of a customer relationship, particularly with our more significant customers. The loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to, or adverse change to trade terms with, a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Failure to leverage our brand value propositions to compete against private label products, especially during economic downturn, may adversely affect our profitability. 
 In many product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with private label products that generally are sold at lower prices. Consumers are more likely to purchase our products if they believe that our products provide a higher quality and greater value than less expensive alternatives. If the difference in quality between our brands and private label products narrows, or if there is a perception of such a narrowing, consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us. In addition, in periods of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to purchase more lower-priced private label or other economy brands. To the extent this occurs, we could experience a reduction in the sales volume of our higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In addition, in times of economic uncertainty, consumers reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at our foodservice customers, which in turn reduces our product sales. 
 LABOR EMPLOYMENT RISK FACTORS 
 Labor shortages and increased turnover or increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability. 
 A number of factors have had and may continue to have adverse effects on the labor force available to us, including government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers health and safety, wage and hour practices and immigration. Labor shortages and increased turnover rates within our team members have led to and could in the future lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our production facilities or otherwise operate at full capacity. An overall or prolonged labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could have a material adverse impact on our operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. 
 We depend on the availability of, and good relations with, our team members and their labor unions. 
 We have approximately 139,000 team members, approximately 39,000 of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions. Our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with team members and the labor unions. If we fail to maintain good relations with our team members or with the labor unions, we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages, which could adversely affect our financial results. 
 If we are unable to attract, hire or retain key team members or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce, it could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Our continued growth requires us to attract, hire, retain and develop key team members, including our executive officers and senior management team, and maintain a highly skilled and diverse global workforce. We compete to attract and hire highly skilled team members and our own team members are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies. Competition could cause us to lose talented team members, and unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge and result in increased costs due to increased competition for team members. In addition, our compensation arrangements may not always be successful in attracting new employees or retaining our existing team members. 
 We depend on contract farmers and independent producers to supply us with livestock. 
 We contract primarily with independent contract farmers to raise the live chickens and turkeys processed in our poultry operations. A majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market. If we do not attract and maintain contracts with farmers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers, our production operations could be negatively affected. Certain of our competitors may also negotiate more favorable contract terms that could provide them with competitive advantages and affect our supply.

LEGAL REGULATORY RISK FACTORS 
 If our products become contaminated, we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which could adversely affect our financial results and damage our reputation. 
 Our products may be subject to contamination by foreign materials or disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella and E. coli. These organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment and there is a risk that one or more, as a result of food processing, could be present in our products. These organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the further-processing, foodservice or consumer level. These risks may be controlled, but may not be eliminated, by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing. We have little, if any, control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution. Even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims, increased scrutiny and penalties, including injunctive relief and plant closings, by federal and state regulatory agencies, and adverse publicity, which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction. Some of our commercial contracts with our customers have uncapped indemnification clauses or no limitation of liability provisions, so any of these occurrences could cause us to pay significant amounts in penalties and spend significant resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. While we also benefit from certain indemnification obligations from our customers, such protections may not adequately cover all claims brought against us or cover only a portion of such claim. In addition, we may be required to recall some of our products if they spoil, become contaminated, are tampered with or are mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. Such a product recall also could result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. 
 New or more stringent domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs on us and could adversely affect our business. 
 Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling and export of our products. See Environmental Regulation and Food Safety in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us (including the United Kingdom s exit from the European Union) could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. For example, increased governmental interest in advertising practices may result in regulations that could require us to change or restrict our advertising practices. Additionally, new laws in the European Union requiring traceability of commodities from source of origin and verification that commodities are deforestation free could impact commodity sourcing, pricing and our ability to place products in certain markets. 
 Increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, as well as alternative energy policies and sustainability initiatives (including those related to single use plastics), may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us. We use natural gas, diesel fuel and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products. Legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our profitability. 
 Climate change and any legal or regulatory responses may have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 Climate change and rising global temperatures may contribute to changing weather patterns, elongated drought periods, heavier or more frequent storms and wildfires, and increased frequency and severity of natural disasters. Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world caused by changing weather patterns has limited and may continue to limit the availability, or may increase the cost, of key agricultural commodities and natural resource ingredients and manufacturing inputs, as well as raw materials such as beef, pork, poultry, corn, soybean meal and other feed ingredients. This in turn could lead to increased food insecurity in communities around the world. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition, climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience and may require us to make additional unplanned capital expenditures. 
 Increasing concern over climate change also may adversely impact demand for our products due to changes in consumer preferences and result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to manage greenhouse gas emissions, climate risks, and resulting environmental impacts. Increased energy or compliance costs and expenses due to increased legal or regulatory requirements could be prohibitively costly and may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the running of our production facilities. Furthermore, compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements may require us to make significant changes to our business operations and strategy, which will likely incur substantial time, attention and costs. Even if we make changes to align ourselves with such legal or regulatory requirements, we may still be subject to significant fines if such laws and regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices. The effects of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 
 16 

Finally, we currently provide certain climate-related disclosures, and from time to time, we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments to reduce our carbon footprint. These disclosures and goals, and our progress towards these commitments, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. There can be no assurance that our current disclosures and targets, and the methodologies that we currently use to support our disclosures and progress towards our targets, will satisfy any new regulations and legal requirements in the U.S. and abroad, and the costs of aligning our current disclosures and goals to any new legal requirements may be significant. Additionally, if we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our carbon emissions reduction goals and commitments, the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our products. 
 The Company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation, proceedings, and investigations. 
 Our past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations, and the ability to comply with any modifications to these laws and regulations, is material to our business. New matters or sites may be identified in the future that will require additional investigation, assessment, or expenditures. In addition, some of our facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous. Future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our present or former properties or manufacturing facilities and/or waste disposal sites could require us to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any of these events, the implementation of new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations, could adversely affect our financial results. 
 Legal claims, class action lawsuits, other regulatory enforcement actions, or failure to comply with applicable legal standards or requirements could affect our product sales, reputation and profitability. 
 We operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. Consequently, we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our team members, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies and procedures. Moreover, a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. Legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those contained in Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, including debarment from governmental contracts that could materially and adversely affect our product sales, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results. 
 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS 
 Our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position. 
 Our indebtedness, including borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan facilities and commercial paper program, may increase from time to time for various reasons, including fluctuations in operating results, working capital needs, capital expenditures and possible acquisitions, joint ventures or other significant initiatives. Our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because: 
 it may limit or impair our ability to obtain financing in the future; 
 our credit ratings (or any decrease to our credit ratings) could restrict or impede our ability to access capital markets at desired interest rates and increase our borrowing costs; 
 it may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise; 
 a portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to interest payments on our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes; and 
 it may restrict our ability to pay dividends. 
 Our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; change the nature of our business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In addition, we are required to maintain a minimum interest expense coverage ratio. 
 Our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens; engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.

An impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth. 
 Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In assessing the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, we make estimates and assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, royalty rates, valuation multiples, and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying these factors. Goodwill valuations have been calculated principally using income and market approaches. The income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. The market approach measures value based on what other purchasers in the market have paid for assets or business interests that can be considered reasonably similar to each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Indefinite life intangible asset valuations have been calculated principally using relief-from-royalty and excess earnings approaches and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Under these valuation approaches, we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate sales growth, operating margins, royalty rates and discount rates, amongst other assumptions. Disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions, including as a result of inflation, could, among other things, cause us to increase the discount rate used in the valuations. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business, increased discount rates or sustained market capitalization declines. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in impairment charges in the future, which could be substantial. At September 30, 2023, we had 14.0 billion of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, which represented approximately 38.5 of total assets. 
 Participation in a Multiemployer Pension Plan could adversely affect our business. 
 We participate in a multiemployer pension plan that provides defined benefits to certain team members covered by collective bargaining agreements. This type of plan is typically administered by a board of trustees composed of the management of the participating companies and labor representatives. We are required to make periodic contributions to this plan to allow the plan to meet its pension benefit obligation to its participants. Our required contributions to this fund could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to this fund, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. In the event that we withdraw from participation in this plan, then applicable law could require us to make additional lump-sum contributions to the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Our withdrawal liability would depend on the extent of the plan s funding of vested benefits. The plan in which we participate is reported to have a significant underfunded liability. Such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability. In the event a withdrawal or partial withdrawal were to occur with respect to the multiemployer plan, the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material. 
 Volatility in the capital markets or interest rates could adversely impact our pension costs and the funded status of our pension plans. 
 We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for team members. The difference between plan obligations and assets, which signifies the funded status of the plans, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the pension plans and our ongoing funding requirements. At September 30, 2023, the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans was an underfunded position of 149 million, as compared to an underfunded position of 159 million at the end of fiscal 2022. Changes in interest rates and the market value of plan assets can impact the funded status of the plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and our future funding requirements. The exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements. 
 Market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions. 
 Our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions. We use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We hold certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures, that are not hedges for financial reporting purposes. These positions are marked to fair value, and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. Therefore, losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results. While these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products, the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices.

GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 Deterioration of economic conditions, including recession, financial instability or inflation, could negatively impact our business. 
 Our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, access to capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges) and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products, or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials, cooking ingredients and packaging materials, thereby negatively affecting our financial results. 
 Disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could, among other things: 
 make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our debt in the future; 
 cause our lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and make more difficult or expensive the granting of any amendment of, or waivers under, our credit agreements to the extent we may seek them in the future; 
 impair the financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers, thereby increasing customer bad debts or non-performance by suppliers; 
 negatively impact global demand for protein products, which could result in a reduction of sales, operating income and cash flows; 
 decrease the value of our investments in equity and debt securities, including our marketable debt securities, company-owned life insurance and pension and other postretirement plan assets; 
 negatively impact our commodity purchasing activities if we are required to record losses related to derivative financial instruments; or 
 impair the financial viability of our insurers. 
 In addition, consumer spending may decline at any time for reasons beyond our control, and the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession, which may reduce consumer confidence and result in a decrease in consumer demand for our products. Furthermore, inflation, which has significantly risen, has and may continue to increase our operational costs, including labor costs and grain and feed ingredient costs, and continued increases in interest rates in response to concerns about inflation may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks. As a result, instability and weakness of the U.S. and global economies, including due to the effects caused by disruptions to financial markets, inflation, recession, high unemployment, geopolitical events and other effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the negative effects on consumers spending, may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations. A prolonged period of reduced consumer spending could have an adverse effect on our business and our results of operations. 
 Extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business. 
 Our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Natural disasters, fire, bioterrorism, pandemic or extreme weather, including droughts, floods, excessive cold or heat, hurricanes or other storms, could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages, fuel shortages, decrease in availability of water, damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels or unfavorably impact the demand for, or our consumers ability to purchase our products, among other things. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial results. 
 Failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could impact our competitiveness. 
 We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also our trade secrets, patents and copyrights, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws, as well as licensing agreements, third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. We cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. 
 We cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. In addition, even if such rights are obtained in the United States, the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Our failure to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 19 

We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax liabilities. 
 We are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. Our total income tax expense could be affected by changes in tax rates in various jurisdictions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results. In December 2021, we received an assessment from the Mexican tax authorities related to the 2015 sale of our direct and indirect equity interests in subsidiaries which held our Mexico operations. At September 30, 2023, the assessment totaled approximately 488 million (8.6 billion Mexican pesos), which includes tax, inflation adjustment, interest and penalties. We believe the assertions made in the assessment letter have no merit and will defend our positions through the Mexican administrative appeal process and litigation, if necessary. Based on our analysis of this assessment in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB guidance related to unrecognized tax benefits, we have not recorded a liability related to the issue.

Our International/Other foreign production operations in Asia-Pacific and China-Korea include one beef facility, 21 chicken processing facilities, three feed mills and one broiler hatchery. The processing facilities include various phases of harvesting, dressing, cutting, packaging, deboning and further-processing. We also have a foreign production operation in Europe which includes a chicken further-processing facility. 
 We believe our present facilities are generally adequate and suitable, have sufficient capacity and are appropriately utilized for our current purposes. Fluctuations in inventories, production and utilization may occur based upon seasonal or other changes in demand for our products. We regularly engage in construction and other capital improvement projects intended to expand capacity and improve the efficiency of our processing and support facilities. We also consider the efficiencies of our operations and may from time to time consider changing the number or type of facilities we operate to align with our capacity needs. 
 
 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 Refer to the description of the Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation, the Broiler Chicken Grower Litigation, the Pork Antitrust Litigation, the Beef Antitrust Litigation and the Wage Rate Litigation under the heading Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference. 
 O n June 19, 2005, the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Environment of the State of Oklahoma filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma against Tyson Foods, Inc., three subsidiaries and six other poultry integrators. The complaint, which was subsequently amended, asserts a number of state and federal causes of action including, but not limited to, counts under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and state-law public nuisance theories. Oklahoma alleges that the defendants and certain contract growers who were not joined in the lawsuit polluted the surface waters, groundwater and associated drinking water supplies of the Illinois River Watershed through the land application of poultry litter. Oklahoma s claims were narrowed through various rulings issued before and during trial and its claims for natural resource damages were dismissed by the district court in a ruling issued on July 22, 2009, which was subsequently affirmed on appeal by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. A non-jury trial of the remaining claims including Oklahoma s request for injunctive relief began on September 24, 2009. Closing arguments were held on February 11, 2010. On January 18, 2023, the district court entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in favor of the State of Oklahoma and directed the parties to confer in an attempt to reach an agreement on appropriate remedies by March 17, 2023. On March 17, 2023, the parties received a 90-day extension from the district court and continued to confer on appropriate remedies. On June 12, 2023, the Court ordered the parties to mediation. The parties attended an in-person mediation on October 12, 2023, but were unable to reach a resolution. Defendants subsequently filed a post-trial motion to dismiss, which remains pending. 
 Other Matters 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 139,000 te am members and, at any time, have various employment practices matters outstanding. In the aggregate, these matters are important to the Company, and we devote considerable resources to managing employment issues. Additionally, we are subject to other lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial amounts) arising out of the conduct of our business. While the ultimate results of these matters cannot be determined, they are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

 PART II 
 
 ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 We have, issued and outstanding, two classes of capital stock, Class A stock and Class B stock. Holders of Class B stock may convert such stock into Class A stock on a share-for-share basis. Holders of Class B stock are entitled to 10 votes per share and holders of Class A stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters submitted to shareholders for approval. As of October 28, 2023, there were approximately 25,000 holders of record of our Class A stock and six holders of record of our Class B stock. 
 DIVIDENDS 
 Cash dividends cannot be paid to holders of Class B stock unless they are simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. The per share amount of the cash dividend paid to holders of Class B stock cannot exceed 90 of the cash dividend simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. In fiscal 2023, the annual dividend rate for Class A stock was 1.92 per share and the annual dividend rate for Class B stock was 1.728 per share. Effective November 10, 2023, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend previously declared on August 10, 2023, to 0.49 per share on our Class A common stock and 0.441 per share on our Class B common stock. The increased quarterly dividend is payable on December 15, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 1, 2023. The Board also declared a quarterly dividend of 0.49 per share on our Class A common stock and 0.441 per share on our Class B common stock, payable on March 15, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2024. We anticipate the remaining quarterly dividends in fiscal 2024 will be 0.49 and 0.441 per share of our Class A and Class B stock, respectively. This results in an annual dividend rate in fiscal 2024 of 1.96 for Class A shares and 1.764 for Class B shares, or a 2 increase compared to the fiscal 2023 annual dividend rate. We have paid uninterrupted quarterly dividends on common stock each year since 1977.

Refer to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2021 for additional information related to fiscal 2021. 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY 
 We are one of the world s largest food companies and a recognized leader in protein. Founded in 1935 by John W. Tyson and grown under four generations of family leadership, the Company has a broad portfolio of products and brands including Tyson , Jimmy Dean , Hillshire Farm , Ball Park , Wright , Aidells , ibp and State Fair . 
 We operate in four reportable segments: Beef, Pork, Chicken and Prepared Foods. We measure segment profit as operating income (loss). International/Other primarily includes our foreign operations in Australia, China, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, Thailand and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, third-party merger and integration costs and corporate overhead related to Tyson New Ventures, LLC. For further description of the business, refer to Part I, Item 1, Business. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 Fiscal year 
 We utilize a 52- or 53-week accounting period ending on the Saturday closest to September 30. The Company s accounting cycle resulted in a 52-week year for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. 
 General 
 Sales decreased slightly to 52.9 billion in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, largely due to decreased sales volumes in our Beef and Pork segments and lower average sales price in our Chicken and Pork segments, partially offset by increased sales volumes in our Chicken segment. We incurred an operating loss of 395 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to operating income of 4,410 million fiscal 2022, as we experienced lower operating income in all our segments other than the Prepared Foods segment. In fiscal 2023, our operating income was impacted by 781 million of goodwill impairment charges, 322 million of plant closure charges, 156 million of legal contingency accruals, 124 million of restructuring and related charges, 17 million of product line discontinuation charges, and benefited by 53 million of insurance proceeds, net of costs incurred, related to fires at our production facilities and 19 million related to the relocation of a production facility in China. In fiscal 2022, our results were impacted by 66 million of restructuring and related charges and 62 million of insurance proceeds, net of costs incurred related to fires at our production facilities. 
 Market Environment 
 According to the USDA, domestic protein production (beef, pork, chicken and turkey) decreased slightly in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. All segments experienced inflation in operating costs, especially in labor and certain materials, however, the rate of inflation started to decrease and protein prices began to level off. We continue to pursue recovery of increased input costs through pricing. Additionally, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia has led to economic sanctions against Russia and certain regions of Ukraine and Belarus. As of September 30, 2023, the impact of this conflict has not had a material direct impact on our consolidated financial performance. However, the conflict is still ongoing and there are many risks and uncertainties in relation to the conflict that are outside of our control. Furthermore, the conflict in the Middle East escalated in October 2023 creating economic and political uncertainty within the region. If these conflicts escalate further, impact additional regions or countries, or additional economic sanctions are imposed, it could have a material impact on our business operations and financial performance. The Beef segment experienced reduced supply of market-ready cattle and increased live cattle costs. The Pork segment experienced sufficient supply and reduced live hog costs, but was negatively impacted by softening global demand. The Chicken segment experienced increased feed ingredient and other input costs along with excess domestic supply impacts to sales pricing. The Prepared Foods segment experienced decreased raw material costs primarily due to lower meat costs. 
 The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates, and it is anticipated that interest rates will continue to rise in the near term. Our direct exposure to rising interest rates is somewhat tempered given our strong liquidity position in addition to our current debt structure in which most of our borrowings have fixed interest rates. At September 30, 2023, we had 3.0 billion of liquidity and our current debt was 1.9 billion. Should we need to issue additional debt or borrow under our existing revolving and term loan facilities, we may be exposed to higher interest rates than our current outstanding borrowings.

Margins 
 Our total operating margin was (0.7) in fiscal 2023. Operating margins by segment were as follows: 
 Beef (0.5) 
 Pork (2.4) 
 Chicken (4.5) 
 Prepared Foods 8.4 
 Strategy 
 Our strategy is to sustainably feed the world with the fastest growing protein brands. We intend to achieve our strategy as we: grow 
 our business by delivering superior value to consumers and customers; deliver fuel for growth and returns through commercial, 
 operational and financial excellence; and sustain our Company and our world for future generations. 
 We launched a new productivity program in fiscal 2022 to drive a better, faster and more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision-making. The execution of the program is supported by a program management office that ensures delivery of key project milestones and reports on savings achievements connected with the three pillars of the program. The first pillar is operational and functional excellence, which includes functional efficiency efforts in Finance, HR and Procurement focused on applying best practices to reduce costs. The second pillar is the use of new digital solutions like artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to drive efficiency in operations, supply chain planning, logistics and warehousing. The third pillar is automation, which will leverage automation and robotics technologies to automate difficult and higher turnover positions. We expect the productivity savings to be recognized in each of our reportable segments as they benefit from the achievements connected with the three pillars of the program. At this time, we do not anticipate costs associated with this program to be material and capital expenditures associated with automation and other activities are included in our capital expenditure expectations. We were targeting 1 billion in productivity savings by the end of fiscal 2024 relative to a fiscal 2021 cost baseline. We realized more than 700 million of productivity savings in fiscal 2022, which partially offset the impacts of inflationary market conditions, and we surpassed our aggregate 1 billion target in fiscal 2023, more than a year ahead of our plan. 
 The Company approved a restructuring program in fiscal 2022, the 2022 Program, which is expected to improve business performance, increase collaboration, enhance team member agility, enable faster decision-making and reduce redundancies. In conjunction with the 2022 Program, the Company relocated all of its corporate team members from the Chicago, Downers Grove and Dakota Dunes area corporate locations to its world headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas, through a phased relocation commencing in early calendar year 2023. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company approved an extension to the program related to removing additional redundancies in corporate overhead. We recognized 124 million and 66 million of pretax charges in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, associated with the 2022 Program consisting of severance related costs, relocation and related costs, accelerated depreciation, contract and lease termination and professional and other fees. The Company currently anticipates the 2022 Program will result in cumulative pretax charges of approximately 224 million. As the Company continues to evaluate its business strategies and long-term growth targets, additional restructuring activities may occur. The following tables set forth the pretax impact of restructuring and related charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income and the pretax impact by our reportable segments for fiscal years ended 2023 and 2022. For further description refer to Part II, Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7: Restructuring and Related Charges (in millions).

SUMMARY OF RESULTS Sales in millions 2023 2022 2021 Sales 52,881 53,282 47,049 Change in sales volume 1.0 (0.3) Change in average sales price (1.5) 12.3 Sales growth (0.8) 13.2 
 2023 vs. 2022 
 Sales Volume Sales were positively impacted by a increase in sales volume, which accounted for an increase of 507 million, driven by increased volumes in our Chicken segment partially offset by decreased volumes in our Beef segment due to the reduced domestic availability of live cattle and our Pork segment as a result of balancing our supply with customer demand. 
 Average Sales Price Sales were negatively impacted by lower average sales prices, which accounted for a decrease of 752 million, driven by reduced pricing in our Pork and Chicken segments, partially offset by higher average sales prices in our Beef and Prepared Foods segments. 
 The above change in average sales price for fiscal 2023 excludes the impact of a 156 million reduction of Sales from the recognition of legal contingency accruals. 
 2022 vs. 2021 
 Sales Volume Sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in sales volume, which accounted for a decrease of 121 million, driven by decreased volumes in our Pork and Prepared Foods segments and impacts associated with the challenging labor environment and continued supply chain constraints, partially offset by an increase in sales volume in our Chicken segment. 
 Average Sales Price Sales were positively impacted by higher average sales prices, which accounted for an increase of 5,809 million. The increase in average sales price was primarily due to the current inflationary environment and recovery of rapidly rising costs. 
 The above change in average sales price for fiscal 2022 excludes the impact of a 545 million reduction of Sales from the recognition of legal contingency accruals in fiscal 2021. 
 Cost of Sales in millions 2023 2022 2021 Cost of sales 50,250 46,614 40,523 Gross profit 2,631 6,668 Cost of sales as a percentage of sales 95.0 87.5 
 2023 vs. 2022 
 Cost of sales increased 3,636 million. Higher sales volume increased cost of sales 444 million while higher input cost per pound increased cost of sales 3,192 million. 
 The 3,192 million impact of higher input cost per pound was impacted by: 
 Increase in live cattle costs of approximately 2,135 million in our Beef segment. 
 Increase due to net derivative losses of 117 million in fiscal 2023, compared to net derivative gains of 225 million in fiscal 2022 due to our risk management activities.

 Increase of 322 million due to costs associated with plant closures. 
 Increase of 238 million related to inventory lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments. 
 Increase of approximately 36 million in our Chicken segment related to net increases in feed ingredients costs and growout expenses, partially offset by reduced outside meat purchases. 
 Increase of approximately 24 million in our Chicken segment due to 11 million of insurance proceeds, net of costs incurred, in fiscal 2023 compared to 35 million of insurance proceeds, net of costs incurred, in fiscal 2022 related to the fire at our production facility in fiscal 2021.

 The 444 million impact of increased sales volume was primarily driven by increased volumes in our Chicken segment. 
 2022 vs. 2021 
 Cost of sales increased 6,091 million. Lower sales volume decreased cost of sales 104 million while higher input cost per pound increased cost of sales 6,195 million. 
 The 6,195 million impact of higher input cost per pound was impacted by:

 Goodwill Impairment 
 2023 vs 2022 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we experienced lower than anticipated operating results and changing market fundamentals, as well as a drop in our market capitalization to below our book value. Consequently, we performed an interim assessment of goodwill and recorded a 448 million goodwill impairment charge. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, long-term treasury rates increased which caused an increase in the discount rates we utilize in determining the fair value of our reporting units. The increased discount rates caused the Company to perform goodwill impairment assessments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, which resulted in an additional 333 million goodwill impairment charge. 
 Interest Expense in millions 2023 2022 355 365 
 2023 / 2022 
 Interest expense primarily included interest expense related to our senior notes, commercial paper, term loans and commitment fees incurred on our revolving credit facility less capitalized interest. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to increased capitalized interest of 25 million and the impact of the redemption of the June 2022 Senior Notes in fiscal 2022, partially offset by increased commercial paper term loan balances. 
 Other (Income) Expense, net in millions 2023 2022 (42) (87) 
 2023 Included 22 million of production facilities fire insurance proceeds, 17 million of foreign exchange gains and 12 million of joint venture earnings. 
 2022 Included 58 million of foreign exchange losses, 52 million of production facilities fires insurance proceeds, 45 million of joint venture earnings and 37 million of gains on equity investments due to observable price changes in fiscal 2022. 
 Effective Tax Rate 2023 2022 4.3 21.7 
 The percentage impacts on the effective tax rate were greater in fiscal 2023 due to the level of pretax income (loss) in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Additionally, tax benefits increased the effective tax rate on a pretax loss in fiscal 2023 and decreased the effective tax rate on pretax income in fiscal 2022. 
 2023 The effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate due to a 781 million non-deductible goodwill impairment, partially offset by income tax credits and a 26 million benefit from the remeasurement of deferred income taxes, primarily due to legislation decreasing state tax rates enacted in fiscal 2023. 
 2022 The effective tax rate includes a 36 million benefit from the remeasurement of deferred income taxes, primarily due to legislation decreasing state tax rates enacted in fiscal 2022.

Operating Income Operating income decreased as margins compressed from historically high levels, paired with continued increased operating costs as a result of inflationary market environment. Operating income benefited from a 71 million gain due to a settlement in fiscal 2022, compared to a 55 million gain from the recovery of cattle inventory in fiscal 2021, related to a cattle supplier s misappropriation of Company funds. Additionally, operating income in fiscal 2022 benefited from 27 million of insurance proceeds related to a fire at a production facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, partially offset by 16 million of restructuring and related charges.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, repurchases of senior notes, repayment of maturing debt, the payment of dividends and share repurchases are expected to be met with current cash on hand, cash flows provided by operating activities or short-term borrowings. Based on our current expectations, we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business. However, we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions. The amount, nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances; our then-current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities in millions 2023 2022 Net income (loss) (649) 3,249 Non-cash items in net income (loss): Depreciation and amortization 1,339 1,202 Deferred income taxes (183) 264 Impairment of goodwill 781 Impairments and disposals of assets 101 34 Stock-based compensation expense 61 93 Other, net 115 (51) Net changes in operating assets and liabilities 187 (2,104) Net cash provided by operating activities 1,752 2,687 
 The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower earnings as a result of operations and a decrease in Accounts Payable, offset by decreases in legal, annual incentive and tax payments, decreases in Accounts Receivable and Inventory, and an increase in insurance proceeds received.

 Additions to property, plant and equipment included spending for production growth, safety and animal well-being, new equipment, infrastructure replacements and upgrades to maintain competitive standing and position us for future opportunities. 
 Approximately 1.3 billion will be necessary to complete buildings and equipment under construction at September 30, 2023. 
 We expect capital expenditures between 1 billion and 1.5 billion for fiscal 2024. Capital expenditures include investments in profit improvement projects as well as projects for maintenance and repair. This includes completion of capacity expansion projects as well as new equipment, automation technology and processes for product innovation. 
 Acquisitions, net of cash for fiscal 2023 included 223 million, net of cash acquired, for our acquisition of Williams Sausage Company and 39 million for the 60 equity stake in Supreme Foods Processing Company, a producer and distributor of value-added and cooked chicken and beef products. 
 Acquisition of equity investments for fiscal 2023 primarily included: the purchase of minority interest in a global insect-based ingredients company; the purchase of a minority interest in a fully integrated poultry company in the Middle East that produces broiler chickens and operates hatcheries and feed mills; and deferred payments related to prior year equity method investment. 
 Acquisition of equity investments for fiscal 2022 included the purchase of a minority interest in a South American-based fully integrated poultry company. 
 Other, net for fiscal 2023 primarily included insurance proceeds received related to fires at our production facilities. Other, net for fiscal 2022 primarily included insurance proceeds received related to fires at our production facilities, proceeds from the disposition of assets and changes in deposits for capital expenditures.

 Purchases of Tyson Class A common stock included: 
 300 million and 587 million of cash paid for shares repurchased pursuant to our share repurchase program in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 54 million and 115 million for shares repurchased to fund certain obligations under our equity compensation plans in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Dividends paid during fiscal 2023 included a 4 increase to our fiscal 2022 quarterly dividend rate.

 Liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and availability under our revolving credit and term loan facilities, less the outstanding commercial paper balance. 
 At September 30, 2023, we had current debt of 1,895 million, which we intend to pay with cash generated from our operating activities and other existing or new liquidity sources. 
 In fiscal 2023, we executed two new term loan facilities totaling 1.75 billion to refinance our short-term promissory notes ("commercial paper program") and for general corporate purposes. The first term loan facility totaling 1.0 billion matures on May 3, 2026 and we borrowed the full 1.0 billion available under this loan facility. The second term loan facility totaling 750 million matures on May 3, 2028 and at September 30, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility. In November 2023, we borrowed the full 750 million available under the second term loan facility to refinance the outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. 
 The revolving credit facility supports our short-term funding needs and also serves to backstop our commercial paper program. We had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility during fiscal 2023. Under the terms of the facility, we have the option to establish incremental commitment increases of up to 500 million if certain conditions are met. 
 We expect net interest expense will approximate 400 million for fiscal 2024. 
 Our ratio of short-term assets to short-term liabilities current ratio was 1.3 to 1 and 1.8 to 1 at September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2022, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to decreased cash and cash equivalents and increased current debt. 
 
 34 

At September 30, 2023, 539 million of our cash was held in the international accounts of our foreign subsidiaries. Generally, we do not rely on the foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. We intend to repatriate any excess cash (net of applicable withholding taxes) not subject to regulatory requirements and to indefinitely reinvest outside of the United States the remainder of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We do not expect the regulatory restrictions or taxes on repatriation to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. 
 Capital Resources 
 Credit and Term Loan Facilities 
 Cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. We also have a revolving credit facility, with a committed capacity of 2.25 billion, to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs and to backstop our commercial paper program. Additionally, we have 1.75 billion in committed term loan facilities of which 1.0 billion was drawn upon as of September 30, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2023, amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit and term loan facilities totaled 3.0 billion. Our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 20 banks, with commitments ranging from 35 million to 175 million per bank. 
 Commercial Paper Program 
 Our commercial paper program provides a low-cost source of borrowing to fund general corporate purposes including working capital requirements. The maximum borrowing capacity under the commercial paper program is 1.5 billion. The maturities of the notes may vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. As of September 30, 2023, we had 592 million commercial paper outstanding under this program with maturities less than 20 days. Our ability to access commercial paper in the future may be limited or its costs increased. 
 Capitalization 
 To monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. We monitor the ratio of our net debt to EBITDA as support for our long-term financing decisions. At September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2022, the ratio of our net debt to EBITDA was 9.1x and 1.3x, respectively. Refer to Other Key Financial Measures below for an explanation and reconciliation to comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP measures. The increase in this ratio at September 30, 2023 is due to an increase in net debt of 1,629 million and a decrease of 4,712 million in EBITDA.

 Debt Covenants 
 Our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; change the nature of our business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In addition, we are required to maintain a minimum interest expense coverage ratio. 
 Our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens; engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. 
 We were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 30, 2023 and expect that we will maintain compliance. 
 Pension Plans 
 As further described in Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15: Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is defined as the amount the projected benefit obligation exceeds the plan assets. The funded status of the plans is an underfunded position of 149 million at the end of fiscal 2023 as compared to an underfunded position of 159 million at the end of fiscal 2022. We contributed 13 million in fiscal 2023 and expect to contribute approximately 15 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2024. The exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements. As a result, the actual funding in fiscal 2024 may be different from the estimate. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations. The off-balance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of obligations related to certain outside third parties, including leases, debt and livestock grower loans, and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. See Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion.

 (1) In the event of a default on payment, acceleration of the principal payments could occur. 
 (2) Interest payments include interest on all outstanding debt. Payments are estimated for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective interest rates at September 30, 2023, and expected payment dates. 
 (3) Amounts include guarantees of obligations related to certain outside third parties, which consist of leases, debt and livestock grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. The amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments. 
 (4) For additional information regarding operating leases, refer to Part II, Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6: Leases. 
 (5) Amounts include agreements with a remaining term in excess of one year to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligations amount included items, such as future purchase commitments for grains and livestock purchase contracts, that provide terms that meet the above criteria. For certain grain purchase commitments with a fixed quantity provision, we have assumed the future obligations under the commitment based on available commodity futures prices as published in observable active markets as of September 30, 2023. We have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. Purchase orders are not included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and is cancellable. Contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded. 
 (6) Amounts include estimated amounts to complete buildings and equipment under construction as of September 30, 2023. 
 (7) Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of deferred compensation, deferred income, self-insurance and asset retirement obligations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount and timing of the remaining payments beyond fiscal 2023; therefore, we have only included the total liability in the table above. We also have employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other postretirement benefits of 193 million that are excluded from the table above. A discussion of the Company's pension and postretirement plans, including funding matters, is included in Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15: Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. 
 In addition to the amounts shown above in the table, we have unrecognized tax benefits of 117 million and related interest and penalties of 50 million at September 30, 2023, recorded in Other long-term liabilities. 
 The potential maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at September 30, 2023, based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier s net tangible assets on that date, aggregated to approximately 295 million. After analyzing residual credit risks and general market conditions, we have recorded an 8 million allowance for these programs' estimated credit losses at September 30, 2023.

OTHER KEY FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 The following are other key financial measures used by the Company for the purposes of assessing performance and highlighting operational trends as well as our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt:

 (a) Excludes the amortization of debt issuance and debt discount expense of 10 million, 11 million, 19 million for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as it is included in Interest expense. 
 (b) Return on invested capital is calculated by dividing after-tax operating income (loss), calculated by applying the Company s effective tax rate to operating income (loss), by the average of beginning and ending total debt and shareholders equity less cash and cash equivalents. 
 (c) For the total debt to capitalization calculation, capitalization is defined as total debt plus total shareholders equity. 
 (d) Book value per share is calculated by dividing shareholders equity by the sum of Class A and B shares outstanding. 
 EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Net debt to EBITDA represents the ratio of our debt, net of cash and short-term investments, to EBITDA. EBITDA and net debt to EBITDA are presented as supplemental financial measurements in the evaluation of our business. We believe the presentation of these financial measures helps investors to assess our operating performance from period to period, including our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt, enhances understanding of our financial performance and highlights operational trends. These measures are widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies; however, the measurements of EBITDA and net debt to EBITDA may not be comparable to those of other companies, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures. EBITDA and net debt to EBITDA are not measures required by or calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and should not be considered as substitutes for net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of operating cash flow or liquidity. EBITDA is a useful tool for assessing, but is not a reliable indicator of, our ability to generate cash to service our debt obligations because certain of the items added to net income to determine EBITDA involve outlays of cash. As a result, actual cash available to service our debt obligations will be different from EBITDA. Investors should rely primarily on our GAAP results, and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally, in making investment decisions.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical. These estimates require levels of subjectivity and judgment, which could result in actual results differing from our estimates. 
 Contingent liabilities 
 Description 
 We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to wage and hour/labor, antitrust, environmental, product, taxing authorities and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses. 
 A determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required, if any, for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue. We accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We disclose contingent liabilities when the risk of loss is reasonably possible or probable. 
 Judgments and Uncertainties 
 Our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events, and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances, differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages, and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control. 
 Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions 
 We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our contingent liabilities during the past three fiscal years. As set forth in Part II, Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies, we recognized 156 million and 626 million of charges in fiscal 2023 and 2021, respectively, from legal accruals related to our broiler antitrust civil litigation, broiler chicken grower litigation, and wage rate litigation based on our assessment of the likelihood and amount of probable losses. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our contingent liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.

 We recognize revenue for the sale of our product at the point in time when our performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our customer, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery to a customer based on terms of the sale. Revenue is measured by the transaction price, which is defined as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for providing goods to customers. The transaction price is adjusted for estimates of known or expected variable consideration, which includes consumer incentives, trade promotions, and allowances, such as coupons, discounts, rebates, volume-based incentives, cooperative advertising, and other programs. Variable consideration related to these programs is recorded as a reduction to revenue based on amounts we expect to pay. 
 Judgments and Uncertainties 
 The transaction price contains estimates of known or expected variable consideration. We base these estimates on current performance, historical utilization, and projected redemption rates of each program. We review and update these estimates regularly until the incentives or product returns are realized and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified. 
 Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions 
 We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to recognize revenue. As noted above, estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Typically, programs that are offered have a short duration, and historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. However, if the level of redemption rates or performance were to vary significantly from estimates, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize revenue during the past three fiscal years. 
 Accrued self-insurance 
 Description 
 We are self-insured for certain losses related to health and welfare, workers compensation, auto liability and general liability claims. We use an independent third-party actuary to assist in determining our self-insurance liability. We and the actuary consider a number of factors when estimating our self-insurance liability, including claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. We periodically review our estimates and assumptions with our third-party actuary to assist us in determining the adequacy of our self-insurance liability. Our policy is to maintain an accrual at the actuarial estimated median. 
 39 

Judgments and Uncertainties 
 Our self-insurance liability contains uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgments used. Costs to settle our obligations, including legal and healthcare costs, could increase or decrease causing estimates of our self-insurance liability to change. Incident rates, including frequency and severity, could increase or decrease causing estimates in our self-insurance liability to change. 
 Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions 
 We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our self-insurance liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. A 10 change in the actuarial estimate at September 30, 2023, would not have a significant impact on our liability. 
 Income taxes 
 Description 
 We estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income. Income tax includes an estimate for withholding taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted but does not include an estimate for taxes on earnings considered to be indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset. We record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. 
 Judgments and Uncertainties 
 Changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future. Our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate. Our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds. 
 Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions 
 Due to the complexity of some of these judgments and uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. To the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefit liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and generally result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would generally be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Other than those potential impacts, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances. 
 Defined benefit pension plans 
 Description 
 We sponsor four defined benefit pension plans that provide retirement benefits to certain team members. We also participate in a multi-employer plan that provides defined benefits to certain team members covered by collective bargaining agreements. Such plans are usually administered by a board of trustees composed of the management of the participating companies and labor representatives. We use independent third-party actuaries to assist us in determining our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost. We and the actuaries review assumptions that include estimates of the present value of the projected future pension payment to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. We accumulate and amortize the effect of actuarial gains and losses over future periods. Net periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit pension plans was 6 million in fiscal 2023. The projected benefit obligation was 176 million at the end of fiscal 2023. Unrecognized actuarial gain was 13 million at the end of fiscal 2023. We currently expect net periodic benefit cost associated with our pension plans to be approximately 7 million in fiscal 2024. We expect to contribute approximately 15 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2024. The exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements. 
 40 

Judgments and Uncertainties 
 Our defined benefit pension plans contain uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgments used. The key assumptions used in developing the required estimates include such factors as discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, retirement rates, and mortality. These assumptions can have a material impact upon the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost. The expected liquidation of certain plans has been considered along with these assumptions. The discount rates were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, were applied to the benefit obligations to determine the appropriate discount rate. In determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we first examined historical rates of return for the various asset classes within the plans. We then determined a long-term projected rate-of-return based on expected returns. Investment, management and other fees paid out of plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. It is reasonably likely that changes in external factors will result in changes to the assumptions used to measure pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost in future periods. 
 The risks of participating in multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans. The net pension cost of the multi-employer plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Assets contributed to such plans are not segregated or otherwise restricted to provide benefits only to our team members. The future cost of these plans is dependent on a number of factors including the funded status of the plans and the ability of the other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations. 
 Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions 
 We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, they are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore generally affect the net periodic benefit cost in future periods. A 1 change in the discount rate at September 30, 2023, would not have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligation or net periodic benefit cost. A 1 change in the return on plan assets at September 30, 2023, would not have a significant impact on net periodic benefit cost. The sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time with the remaining assumptions held constant. Economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effect of changes in assumptions are not necessarily linear. 
 Impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 
 Description 
 Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite life intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. We have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. However, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets outside of the required annual assessment if, among other things, we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business, sustained decline in market capitalization or significant changes in macro-economic factors such as increased interest and discount rates. 
 We evaluate goodwill for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. If it is determined, based on qualitative factors, the fair value of the reporting unit may more likely than not be less than its carrying amount or if significant changes to macro-economic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Additionally, we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test. Upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. 
 For indefinite life intangible assets, a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired. Similar to goodwill, we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test. Upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 
 
 41 

Judgments and Uncertainties 
 We estimate the fair value of our reporting units considering the use of various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being an income approach (discounted cash flow method) and another technique being a market approach (guideline public company method), which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. We include assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, discount rates and valuation multiples which consider our budgets, business plans, economic projections and marketplace data, and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Assumptions are also made for varying growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. Generally, we utilize operating margin assumptions based on future expectations, macro-economic trends, operating margins historically realized in the reporting units industries and industry marketplace valuation multiples. We consider reporting units that have 20 or less excess fair value over carrying amount to have a heightened risk of impairment. Our fiscal 2022 and 2021 goodwill impairment analyses did not result in impairment charges. 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we experienced lower than previously anticipated operating results and changing market fundamentals, as well as a drop in our market capitalization to below book value. Consequently, based on our qualitative assessment, we determined it was necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for all of our reporting units. Based on this assessment, we determined that all of our reporting units estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values other than one of our Chicken segment reporting units and two of our International/Other reporting units. For these reporting units, we recognized a 448 million goodwill impairment charge including 210 million to partially impair the goodwill of a Chicken segment reporting unit and 238 million to fully impair the goodwill of two of our International/Other reporting units. 
 We performed our annual impairment assessment as of the first day of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and determined it was necessary to perform quantitative assessments for our Beef, Pork and two Chicken segment reporting units, as all of these reporting units were at heightened risk of impairment following the third quarter assessment. Based on this assessment, we determined that our Beef, Pork and two Chicken reporting units estimated fair values exceeded their carrying value, and thus, it did not result in any additional goodwill impairments. 
 However, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we experienced an increase in long-term treasury rates which caused a net 50 basis point increase in the discount rates used in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Consequently, because of our qualitative assessment, we determined it was necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for our Beef, Pork and two Chicken segment reporting units as of September 30, 2023. Based on this quantitative assessment, we determined that our Pork and two Chicken segment reporting units' estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values. The fair value of our Beef reporting unit, which had 676 million of goodwill at the time of the assessment, did not exceed its carrying value. For the Beef reporting unit, the increased discount rate resulted in a decrease in its estimated fair value to below its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a 333 million goodwill impairment charge to partially impair its goodwill. Following the September 30, 2023 assessment, our Beef, Pork and two Chicken segment reporting units, with total goodwill of approximately 3.8 billion, are at heightened risk of impairment. 
 Our Beef segment reporting unit had goodwill of 0.3 billion at September 30, 2023, after the impairment. In estimating its fair value, we generally assumed operating margins in future years would normalize over time as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. The current year results are not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction primarily due to challenging market conditions associated with lower cattle supplies which impacts we expect to be mostly temporary in nature. The Beef reporting unit's goodwill was written down to its fair value resulting in no excess fair value over carrying amount as of September 30, 2023. Any increase in the discount rate or reduced estimated long-term operating margins to below 2.0 -3.0 (breakeven), with all other assumptions unchanged, would have caused the carrying value of this reporting unit to exceed its fair value, which may have resulted in an additional material goodwill impairment loss. 
 Our Pork segment reporting unit had goodwill at September 30, 2023 of 0.4 billion. We generally assumed operating margins in future years would normalize over time as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. Had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those in fiscal 2023, we would have failed the impairment quantitative tests, which may have resulted in material goodwill impairment losses. The current year results are not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction primarily due to challenging market conditions associated with higher availability of live hogs supplies during a period of reduced global demand and compressed pork margins which impacts we expect to be mostly temporary in nature. To pass the impairment quantitative tests, projected long-term operating margins, utilizing the discounted cash flow method, had to average approximately 4.0 -5.0 (breakeven). Additionally, a hypothetical increase in the discount rate of approximately 10-25 basis points at September 30, 2023, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have caused the carrying value of this reporting unit to exceed its fair value, which may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss. 
 
 42 

Our Chicken segment reporting units had goodwill at September 30, 2023 of 3.1 billion. We generally assumed operating margins in future years would normalize over time as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. Had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in fiscal 2023, we would have failed the impairment quantitative test, which may have resulted in material goodwill impairment losses. The current year results are not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction primarily due to challenging market conditions associated with excess domestic supply impacts, losses incurred associated with derivatives, legal contingencies, and restructuring, which impacts we expect to be mostly temporary in nature. To pass the impairment quantitative test, projected long-term operating margins, utilizing the discounted cash flow method, had to average approximately 5.0 -6.0 (breakeven). Additionally, a hypothetical increase in the discount rate of approximately 25-50 basis points at September 30, 2023, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have caused the carrying values of the Chicken segment's reporting units to approximate its fair value, which may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss. 
 Our remaining reporting units had goodwill of 6.0 billion at September 30, 2023, and were not considered at heightened risk of impairment as of the date of its most recent estimated fair value determination which was in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. A hypothetical increase in the discount rate of approximately 125-150 basis points as of the date of its most recent estimated fair value determination, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have caused the carrying value of the Prepared Foods reporting unit, with goodwill of 5.9 billion at September 30, 2023, to approximate its fair value. Discount rates utilized in the discounted cash flow method have increased approximately 50 basis points since the third quarter of fiscal 2023 assessment through September 30, 2023. 
 The fair value of our indefinite life intangible assets is calculated principally using multi-period excess earnings and relief-from-royalty valuation approaches, which uses significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy, and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Under these valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. We consider indefinite life intangible assets that have 20 or less excess fair value over carrying amount to have a heightened risk of impairment. Our fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 indefinite life intangible assets impairment analyses did not result in an impairment charge. 
 All of our indefinite life intangible assets estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values by more than 20 at the date of the most recent estimated fair value determination, which was in the annual assessment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, other than two of our Prepared Foods brands with carrying values of 0.5 billion and 0.3 billion at September 30, 2023. For the brand with a carrying value 0.5 billion, a hypothetical increase in the discount rate of approximately 50 basis points as of the date of the most recent estimated fair value, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have caused the carrying value to approximate its fair value. For the brand with a carrying value 0.3 billion, a hypothetical increase in the discount rate of approximately 100 basis points as of the date of the most recent estimated fair value, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have caused the carrying value to approximate its fair value. We generally assumed operating margins and growth rates in future years would normalize over time as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. Had we assumed future operating margins and growth rates consistent with those realized in fiscal 2023, we would have failed the impairment quantitative test, which may have resulted in material impairment losses. The current year results are not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction primarily due to the impacts of rapid inflationary pressures and volatile market conditions which impacts we expect to be mostly temporary in nature. We do not currently consider any of our other indefinite life intangible assets, which had aggregate carrying value of 3.3 billion at September 30, 2023, to be at heightened risk of impairment. 
 Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions 
 We have not made material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the last three years. 
 Our impairment analysis contains inherent estimates and assumptions, many of which are outside the control of management including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, market EBITDA comparables and credit ratings, which could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. The assumptions and estimates used in determining fair value require considerable judgement and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions. These assumptions can change in future periods as a result of overall economic conditions, including the impacts of inflationary pressures, increased interest and discount rates, global supply chain constraints and decreased market capitalization, amongst others. As a result, there can be no assurance that estimates and assumptions made for the purpose of assessing impairments will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Potential circumstances that could have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets include, but are not limited to, lower than forecasted growth rates or operating margins and changes in discount rates. A reduction in the estimated fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets could trigger an impairment in the future. We cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. 
 
 43 

We continuously evaluate the changing macro-economic conditions including inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, demand outlook and export markets as well as the Company s decreased market capitalization. Our reporting units with heightened risk of future impairments with 3.8 billion carrying value at September 30, 2023, as well as the brand with 0.5 billion carrying value, as described above, all have less than 10 of excess fair value above carrying value as of the date of the most recent estimated fair value determination. Consequently, their estimated fair values remain highly sensitive to future discount rate increases, changing macro-economic conditions and achievement of projected long-term operating margins. Discount rates increased by approximately 50 basis points from the date of our annual impairment assessment to September 30, 2023. Although the remaining reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets generally had more than 20 excess fair value over carrying amount as of the date of the most recent estimated fair value determination, they are also susceptible to impairments if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors significantly change in the future. 
 Impairment of long-lived assets and definite life intangibles 
 Description 
 Long-lived assets and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use the asset, a change in its physical condition, or an unexpected change in financial performance. 
 When evaluating long-lived assets and definite life intangibles for impairment, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated undiscounted future cash flows. An impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset group. For assets held for sale, we compare the carrying value of the disposal group to fair value. The impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. 
 We recorded charges related to long-lived assets of 101 million, 34 million and 60 million, in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Judgments and Uncertainties 
 Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions, including useful lives and intended use of assets, observable market valuations, forecasted sales growth, operating margins, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows to determine fair value. 
 Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions 
 We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long-lived assets or definite life intangibles during the last three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments or useful lives of long-lived assets or definite life intangibles. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material. We periodically conduct projects to strategically evaluate optimization of such items as network capacity, manufacturing efficiencies and business technology. If we have a significant change in strategies, outlook, or a manner in which we plan to use these assets, we may be exposed to future impairments. 
 Business Combinations 
 Description 
 We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control of a business is obtained, 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
 We use various models to determine the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such as net realizable value to value inventory, cost method and market approach to value property, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings to value intangibles and discounted cash flow to value goodwill. 
 For significant acquisitions we may use independent third-party valuation specialists to assist us in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
 Judgments and Uncertainties 
 Significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, particularly intangible assets. We make estimates and assumptions about projected future cash flows including sales growth, operating margins, attrition rates, and discount rates based on historical results, business plans, expected synergies, perceived risk and marketplace data considering the perspective of marketplace participants. 
 Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives. 
 
 44 

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions 
 While management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions, which could result in subsequent impairments. For more information regarding business combinations, refer to Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3: Acquisitions and Dispositions. 
 
 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. To address certain of these risks, we enter into various derivative transactions as described below. If a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, or be recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of an instrument s change in fair value is recognized immediately. 
 Further, we hold certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges. With the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery, we record these positions at fair value, and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. 
 The sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential changes in fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities. Sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes, nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity. Actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes. 
 COMMODITIES RISK 
 We purchase certain commodities, such as grains and livestock, during normal operations. As part of our commodity risk management activities, we use derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards and options, to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity. However, as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations, any requirement to mark-to-market the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations. Contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. We generally do not hedge anticipated transactions beyond 18 months. The following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, on the fair value of open positions. The fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted forward and option prices. The market risk exposure analysis included both derivatives designated as hedge instruments and derivatives not designated as hedge instruments. 
 Effect of 10 change in fair value in millions 2023 2022 Livestock: Live Cattle 68 14 Lean Hogs 10 30 Grain: Corn 23 40 Soybean Meal 22 25 
 INTEREST RATE RISK 
 At September 30, 2023, we had variable rate debt of 1,608 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.2 . A hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates effective at September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2022, would not have a significant effect on variable interest expense. 
 Additionally, changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt. At September 30, 2023, we had fixed-rate debt of 7,898 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.5 . Market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value, resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates. A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would have changed the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately 215 million at September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022. The fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices and/or published interest rates. 
 
 45 

We are subject to interest rate risk associated with our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations. Changes in interest rates impact the liabilities associated with these benefit plans as well as the amount of income or expense recognized for these plans. Declines in the value of the plan assets could diminish the funded status of the pension plans and potentially increase the requirements to make cash contributions to these plans. See Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15: Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits for additional information. 
 FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK 
 We have foreign exchange exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances. The primary currencies we have exposure to are the Australian dollar, the Brazilian real, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the European euro, the Malaysian ringgit, the Mexican peso, and the Thai baht. We periodically enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates related to the foreign exchange forward and option contracts would have had a 17 million and 25 million impact on pretax income at September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively. 
 CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK 
 Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral. At September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, 15.9 and 16.4 , respectively, of our net accounts receivable balance was due from Walmart Inc. No other single customer or customer group represented 10 or greater of net accounts receivable.

to years, machinery and equipment of to years and land improvements and other of to years. Major repairs and maintenance costs that significantly extend the useful life of the related assets are capitalized. Normal repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets at each balance sheet date if indication of impairment exists. Recoverability is assessed using undiscounted cash flows based on historical results and current projections of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We measure impairment as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of an asset group. The fair value of an asset group is generally measured using discounted cash flows including market participant assumptions of future operating results and discount rates. 
 years or less. Customer relationships and supply arrangements are generally amortized over to years based on the pattern of revenue expected to be generated from the use of the asset. The gross cost and accumulated amortization of intangible assets are removed when the recorded amounts are fully amortized and the asset is no longer in use or the contract has expired. Amortization expense is generally recognized in selling, general, and administrative expense. We review the carrying value of definite life intangibles at each balance sheet date if indication of impairment exists. Recoverability is assessed using undiscounted cash flows based on historical results and current projections of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We measure impairment as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the definite life intangible asset group. We use various valuation techniques to estimate fair value, with the primary techniques being discounted cash flows, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings valuation approaches, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. Under these valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. 
 Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Our goodwill is allocated by reporting unit and is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. If it is determined, based on qualitative factors, the fair value of the reporting unit may more likely than not be less than carrying amount, or if significant changes to macro-economic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. Additionally, we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test. The quantitative test is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. 
 We estimate the fair value of our reporting units considering the use of various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being an income approach (discounted cash flow method), with another technique being a market approach (guideline public company method), which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. We include assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, discount rates and valuations multiples which consider our budgets, business plans, economic projections and marketplace data, and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. Generally, we utilize operating margin assumptions based on future expectations, operating margins historically realized in the reporting units' industries and industry marketplace valuation multiples. 
 Some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, market EBITDA comparables and credit ratings. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, it could result in additional material impairments of our goodwill.

million goodwill impairment charge of which million and million was recognized in our Chicken segment and International/Other, respectively. We performed our annual impairment assessment as of the first day of our fourth quarter in fiscal 2023, and it did not result in an additional goodwill impairment. However, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we experienced an increase in long-term treasury rates which caused a net 50 basis point increase in the discount rates used in estimating the fair value of the reporting units, and we determined it was necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for the Beef, Pork and two Chicken segment reporting units as of September 30, 2023. Based on this quantitative assessment, we determined that our Pork and two Chicken segment reporting units' estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values. For the Beef reporting unit, the increased discount rate resulted in a decrease in its estimated fair value to below its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a million goodwill impairment charge to partially impair its goodwill. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we determined none of our reporting units fair values were below its carrying value. 
 We consider reporting units that have or less excess fair value over carrying amount to have a heightened risk of impairment. The following reporting units' were considered at heightened risk of impairment as of the date of the most recent estimated fair value determination: our Chicken segment reporting units, our Beef reporting unit and our Pork reporting unit with goodwill totaling billion, billion and billion, respectively, at September 30, 2023. 
 For our indefinite life intangible assets, a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired. Similar to goodwill, we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test. Upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 
 The fair value of our indefinite life intangible assets is calculated principally using multi-period excess earnings and relief-from-royalty valuation approaches, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy, and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Under these valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we determined the fair value of each of our indefinite life intangible assets exceeded its carrying value. We consider indefinite life intangible assets that have 20 or less excess fair value over carrying amount to have a heightened risk of impairment. All of our indefinite life intangible assets estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination, which was in the annual assessment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, other than two of our Prepared Foods brands with carrying values of billion and billion as of September 30, 2023. 
 Our reporting units with heightened risk of future impairments with 3.8 billion carrying value at September 30, 2023, as well as the brand with 0.5 billion carrying value, as described above, all have less than 10 of excess fair value above carrying value as of the date of the most recent estimated fair value determination. Consequently, their estimated fair values remain highly sensitive to future discount rate increases, changing macro-economic conditions and achievement of projected long-term operating margins. Discount rates increased by approximately 50 basis points from the date of our annual impairment assessment to September 30, 2023. Although the remaining reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets generally had more than 20 excess fair value over carrying amount as of the date of the most recent estimated fair value determination, they are also susceptible to impairments if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors significantly change in the future.

million and million at September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively. 
 Investments not accounted for using the equity method do not have readily determinable fair values and do not qualify for the practical expedient to measure the investment using a net asset value per share. These investments are recorded using the measurement alternative in which our equity interests are recorded at cost, less impairments, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. At each reporting period, we assess if these investments continue to qualify for this measurement alternative. An impairment is recorded when there is evidence that the expected fair value of the investment has declined to below the recorded cost. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Investments in joint ventures and other entities are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other Assets. 
 We also have investments in marketable debt securities. We have determined all of our marketable debt securities are available-for-sale investments. These investments are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in other comprehensive income. 
 The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization is recorded in interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities and declines in value due to credit-related factors are recorded on a net basis in other income. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded in interest income.

Plant Closures 
 During fiscal 2023, as part of a strategic review of assets, the Company approved the closure of six Chicken segment processing facilities located in Glen Allen, Virginia; Van Buren, Arkansas; Corydon, Indiana; Dexter, Missouri; Noel, Missouri; and North Little Rock, Arkansas, to optimize asset utilization. We shifted production to other facilities and ceased operations at our Glen Allen and Van Buren facilities during fiscal 2023 and expect to shift production and cease operations at the remaining locations during the first half of fiscal 2024. As a result of the closures, we recorded million of charges in fiscal 2023, primarily related to grower contract terminations, impairments, accelerated depreciation, severance, retention and related costs. Additionally, during fiscal 2023, we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the discontinuation of a product line in the Prepared Foods segment. The charges are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Cost of Sales and included million of charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows and million in non-cash charges. Our plant closure liability was million as of September 30, 2023, and we had no plant closure liability as of October 1, 2022. We made cash payments of million in fiscal 2023 related to the plant closures. We continue to strategically evaluate optimization of such items as network capacity, manufacturing efficiencies and business technology. If we have a significant change in strategies, outlook, or a manner in which we plan to use these assets, we may be exposed to future impairments.

billion revolving credit facility that supports short-term funding needs and serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. The facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate in September 2026 with options for two one-year extensions. At September 30, 2023, amounts available for borrowing under this facility totaled billion before deducting amounts to backstop our commercial paper program. At September 30, 2023 we had borrowings and outstanding letters of credit issued under this facility. At September 30, 2023 we had million of bilateral letters of credit issued separately from the revolving credit facility, none of which were drawn upon. Our letters of credit are issued primarily in support of workers compensation insurance programs and other legal obligations. In the future, if any of our subsidiaries shall guarantee any of our material indebtedness, such subsidiary shall be required to guarantee the indebtedness, obligations and liabilities under this facility. In November 2022, we entered into an amendment to change the reference rate from the London interbank offered rate (commonly referred to as LIBOR) to a rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (commonly referred to as SOFR). 
 Commercial Paper Program 
 We have a commercial paper program under which we may issue unsecured short-term promissory notes up to an aggregate maximum principal amount of billion. As of September 30, 2023, we had million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of with maturities of less than days . Our ability to access commercial paper in the future may be limited or its costs increased. 
 Term Loan Facilities 
 In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we executed two new term loan facilities totaling billion to refinance our short-term promissory notes ("commercial paper program") and for general corporate purposes. The first term loan facility totaling billion matures on May 3, 2026 and we borrowed the full billion available under this loan facility. The second term loan facility totaling million matures on May 3, 2028 and at September 30, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility. In November 2023, we borrowed the full million available under the second term loan facility to refinance the outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. Both term loans may be prepaid under certain conditions. The interest rate on both term loan facilities will be equal to SOFR plus a predetermined borrowing spread determined by our credit rating. Additionally, the term loan facilities contain covenants that are similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility. 
 Debt Covenants 
 Our revolving credit facility and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; change the nature of our business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In addition, we are required to maintain a minimum interest expense coverage ratio. 
 Our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens; engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. 
 We were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 30, 2023.

As of September 30, 2023, TLP owned of the outstanding shares of Class B stock and the TLP and members of the Tyson family owned, in the aggregate, of the outstanding shares of Class A stock, giving them, collectively, control of approximately of the total voting power of the outstanding voting stock. 
 The Class B stock is considered a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic earnings per share. The two-class computation method for each period reflects the cash dividends paid for each class of stock, plus the amount of allocated undistributed earnings (losses) computed using the participation percentage, which reflects the dividend rights of each class of stock. Basic earnings per share were computed using the two-class method for all periods presented. The shares of Class B stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since the shares of Class B stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of Class A stock. Diluted earnings per share, if dilutive, were computed assuming the conversion of the Class B shares into Class A shares as of the beginning of each period.

Based on our analysis of this assessment in accordance with FASB guidance related to unrecognized tax benefits, we have not recorded a liability related to the issue. 
 As of September 30, 2023, certain United States federal income tax returns are subject to examination for fiscal years 2019 through 2022. We are also subject to income tax examinations by major state and foreign jurisdictions for fiscal years 2014 through 2022 and 2018 through 2022, respectively.

As a result, the Class B weighted average shares, dividends declared and undistributed losses were excluded for the purposes of calculating Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Tyson on a diluted basis. 
 Approximately million, million, and million of our stock-based compensation shares were antidilutive for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. These shares were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. 
 We have classes of capital stock, Class A stock and Class B stock. Cash dividends cannot be paid to holders of Class B stock unless they are simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. The per share amount of cash dividends paid to holders of Class B stock cannot exceed of the cash dividends paid to holders of Class A stock. 
 We allocate undistributed earnings (losses) based upon a to ratio per share to Class A stock and Class B stock, respectively. We allocate undistributed earnings (losses) based on this ratio due to historical dividend patterns, voting control of Class B shareholders and contractual limitations of dividends to Class B stock.

 We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales expected to result in physical delivery. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, we designate the hedging instrument based upon the exposure being hedged (i.e., cash flow hedge or fair value hedge). We designate certain forward contracts as follows: 
 Cash Flow Hedges include certain commodity forward and option contracts of forecasted purchases (i.e., grains), interest rate swaps and locks, and certain foreign exchange forward contracts. 
 Fair Value Hedges include certain commodity forward contracts of firm commitments (i.e., livestock). 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 Derivative instruments are designated as hedges against changes in the amount of future cash flows related to procurement of certain commodities utilized in our production processes as well as interest rates to our variable rate debt. For the derivative instruments we designate and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings in the current period. Ineffectiveness related to our cash flow hedges was not significant during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. As of September 30, 2023, we have million of realized losses related to treasury rate locks in connection with the issuance of the 2026, 2029 and 2048 Notes, which will be reclassified to earnings over the lives of these notes. During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we had no gains or losses recognized in OCI on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. 
 Fair Value Hedges 
 We designate certain derivative contracts as fair value hedges of firm commitments to purchase livestock for harvest. Our objective of these hedges is to minimize the risk of changes in fair value created by fluctuations in commodity prices associated with fixed price livestock firm commitments. For these derivative instruments we designate and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the same period. We include the gain or loss on the hedged items (i.e., livestock purchase firm commitments) in the same line item, Cost of Sales, as the offsetting gain or loss on the related livestock forward position. Ineffectiveness related to our fair value hedges was not significant during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021.

 Undesignated Positions 
 In addition to our designated positions, we also hold derivative contracts for which we do not apply hedge accounting.

Total realized and unrealized gains (losses): Included in other comprehensive income (loss) ) Purchases Settlements ) ) Balance at end of year 
 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument: 
 Derivative Assets and Liabilities 
 Our derivative financial instruments primarily include exchange-traded and over-the-counter contracts which are further described in Note 12: Derivative Financial Instruments. We record our derivative financial instruments at fair value using quoted market prices, adjusted where necessary for credit and non-performance risk and internal models that use readily observable market inputs as their basis, including current and forward market prices and rates. We classify these instruments in Level 2 when quoted market prices can be corroborated utilizing observable current and forward commodity market prices on active exchanges or observable market transactions. 
 Available for Sale Securities 
 Our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value based on pricing models and quoted market prices adjusted for credit and non-performance risk. Short-term investments with maturities of less than months are included in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and primarily include certificates of deposit and commercial paper. All other marketable debt securities are included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and have maturities ranging up to years. 
 We classify our investments in U.S. government, U.S. agency, certificates of deposit and commercial paper debt securities as Level 2 as fair value is generally estimated using discounted cash flow models that are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including time value and yield curve as well as other readily available relevant economic measures. We classify certain corporate, asset-backed and other debt securities as Level 3 as there is limited activity or less observable inputs into valuation models, including current interest rates and estimated prepayment, default and recovery rates on the underlying portfolio or structured investment vehicle. Significant changes to assumptions or unobservable inputs in the valuation of our Level 3 instruments would not have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements. 
 ) ) Corporate and Asset-Backed ) ) 
 Unrealized holding gains (losses), net of tax, are excluded from earnings and reported in OCI until the security is settled or sold. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate whether losses related to our available-for-sale securities are due to credit or noncredit factors. Losses on debt securities where we have the intent, or will more than likely be required, to sell the security prior to recovery, would be recorded as a direct write-off of amortized cost basis through earnings. Losses on debt securities where we do not have the intent, or would not more than likely be required to sell the security prior to recovery, would be further evaluated to determine whether the loss is credit or non-credit related. Credit-related losses would be recorded through an allowance for credit losses through earnings and non-credit related losses through OCI. 
 We consider many factors in determining whether a loss is credit-related, including the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, borrower repayment characteristics for asset-backed securities, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. We recognized no direct write-offs or allowances for credit losses in earnings in fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021.

million, million and million in our Beef and Chicken segments and International/Other, respectively. We estimated the fair value of our reporting units utilizing various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being an income approach (discounted cash flow method) and another technique being a market approach (guideline public company method), which incorporated significant unobservable Level 3 inputs. During fiscal 2022, we recognized gains of million in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, based upon observable price changes. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using Level 3 inputs and are included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We did not have any other significant measurements of assets or liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition during the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, October 1, 2022, or October 2, 2021. 
 Other Financial Instruments 
 
 Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral. At September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2022, and , respectively, of our net accounts receivable balance was due from Walmart Inc. No other single customer or customer group represented greater than of net accounts receivable.

 The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was , and , respectively. The fair value of each option grant is established on the date of grant using a binomial lattice method. We use historical volatility for a period of time comparable to the expected life of the option to determine volatility assumptions. Expected life is calculated based on the contractual term of each grant and takes into account the historical exercise and termination behavior of participants. Risk-free interest rates are based on the five-year Treasury bond rate.

We had million, million and million restricted stock awards vest in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with a grant date fair value of million, million and million, respectively. 
 Performance-Based Shares 
 We award performance-based shares of our Class A stock to certain team members. These awards are typically granted once a year. Performance-based shares vest based upon the passage of time and the achievement of performance or market performance criteria, ranging from to , as determined by the Compensation Committee prior to the date of the award. Vesting periods for these awards are . We review progress toward the attainment of the performance criteria each quarter during the vesting period. When it is probable the minimum performance criteria for an award will be achieved, we begin recognizing the expense equal to the proportionate share of the total fair value of the Class A stock price on the grant date. The total expense recognized over the duration of performance awards will equal the Class A stock price on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares ultimately awarded based on the level of attainment of the performance criteria. For grants with market performance criteria, the fair value is determined on the grant date and is calculated using the same inputs for expected volatility, expected dividend yield, and risk-free rate as stock options, noted above, with a duration of . The total expense recognized over the duration of the award will equal the fair value, regardless if the market performance criteria is met.

 Multi-Employer Plan 
 Additionally, we participate in multi-employer plan that provides defined benefits to certain team members covered by collective bargaining agreements. Such plans are usually administered by a board of trustees composed of the management of the participating companies and labor representatives. 
 The risks of participating in multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans. Assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to team members of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligation of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If we stop participating in a plan, we may be required to pay that plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. 
 The net pension cost of the plan is equal to the annual contributions determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Contributions to the plan were million in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Assets contributed to such plans are not segregated or otherwise restricted to provide benefits only to our team members. The future cost of the plans is dependent on a number of factors including the funded status of the plans and the ability of the other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations. 
 Our participation in the multi-employer plan for fiscal 2023 is outlined below. The EIN/Pension Plan Number column provides the Employer Identification Number EIN and the three-digit plan number. The most recent Pension Protection Act PPA zone status available in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 is for the plan s year beginning January 1, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The zone status is based on information that we have received from the plan and is certified by the plan s actuaries. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65 percent funded. Plans that are critical and declining status are projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency. The FIP/RP Status column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan FIP or rehabilitation plan RP is either pending or has been implemented. The last column lists the expiration date of the collective-bargaining agreement to which the plan is subject.

 We have cash flow assistance programs in which certain livestock suppliers participate. Under these programs, we pay an amount for livestock equivalent to a standard cost to grow such livestock during periods of low market sales prices. The amounts of such payments that are in excess of the market sales price are recorded as receivables and accrue interest. Participating suppliers are obligated to repay these receivables balances when market sales prices exceed this standard cost, or upon termination of the agreement. Our maximum commitment associated with these programs is limited to the fair value of each participating livestock supplier s net tangible assets. The potential maximum obligation as of September 30, 2023, was approximately million. The total receivables under these programs were million and million at September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively. These receivables are included, net of allowance for uncollectible amounts, in Accounts Receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Even though these programs are limited to the net tangible assets of the participating livestock suppliers, we also manage a portion of our credit risk associated with these programs by obtaining security interests in livestock suppliers assets.

The Industrial Revenue Bonds and the associated obligations for the leases of the facilities offset, and the underlying assets remain in property, plant and equipment. At September 30, 2023, total amounts under these types of arrangements totaled million.

million in settlement of all outstanding claims brought by the Classes. On February 23, 2021, March 22, 2021 and October 15, 2021, the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlements with the putative Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class, the putative End-User Plaintiff Class and the putative Commercial and Institutional Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff Class, respectively. On June 29, 2021, December 20, 2021 and April 18, 2022, the Court granted final approval to the settlements with the Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class, the End-User Plaintiff Class and the Commercial and Institutional Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff Class, respectively. The foregoing settlements do not settle claims made by plaintiffs who opt out of the Classes in the Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation. 
 We are currently pursuing settlement discussions with the remaining opt-out plaintiffs with respect to the remaining claims. While we do not admit any liability as part of the settlements, we believe that the settlements were in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation. During fiscal years 2023 and 2021 , the Company recorded aggregate legal contingency accruals of million and million, respectively, for claims related to this matter. Additionally, d uring fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company reduced its total recorded legal contingency accrual by million, million and million, respectively, for amounts it had paid related to this matter. Accordingly, at September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, the legal contingency accrual for claims related to this matter was million and million, respectively. 
 Government Investigations 
 U.S. Department of Justice DOJ Antitrust Division . On June 21, 2019, the DOJ filed a motion to intervene and sought a limited stay of discovery in the Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation, which the court granted in part. Subsequently, we received a grand jury subpoena from the DOJ seeking additional documents and information related to the chicken industry. On June 2, 2020, a grand jury for the District of Colorado returned an indictment charging four individual executives employed by two other poultry processing companies with conspiracy to engage in bid-rigging in violation of federal antitrust laws. On June 10, 2020, we announced that we uncovered information in connection with the grand jury subpoena that we had previously self-reported to the DOJ and have been cooperating with the DOJ as part of our application for leniency under the DOJ s Corporate Leniency Program. Subsequently, the DOJ has announced indictments against additional individuals, as well as other poultry processing companies, alleging a conspiracy to fix prices and rig bids for broiler chicken products from at least 2012 until at least early 2019. In August 2021, the Company was granted conditional leniency by the DOJ for the matters we self-reported, which means that provided the Company continues to cooperate with the DOJ, neither the Company nor any of our cooperating employees will face prosecution or criminal fines or penalties. We continue to cooperate with the DOJ in connection with the ongoing federal antitrust investigation.

million for which the Company recorded an accrual in its Consolidated Financial Statements as of October 1, 2022, The Company paid the settlement during fiscal 2023. While we do not admit any liability as part of the settlement, we believe that the settlement was in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation. We are cooperating with various state governmental agencies and officials, including the Offices of the Attorneys General for Florida and Louisiana, investigating or otherwise seeking information, testimony and/or documents, regarding the conduct alleged in the Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation and related matters. While the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims that have been made, we are exploring whether it is possible to resolve them in such a way that will serve the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation. As of September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an accrual for the estimated probable losses that it expects to incur for this matter in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Broiler Chicken Grower Litigation 
 On January 27, 2017 and March 26, 2017, putative class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our poultry subsidiaries, as well as several other vertically integrated poultry processing companies, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma styled In re Broiler Chicken Grower Litigation. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the defendants colluded not to compete for broiler raising services with the purpose and effect of fixing, maintaining, and/or stabilizing grower compensation below competitive levels. The plaintiffs also allege that the defendants agreed to share detailed data on [g]rower compensation with one another, with the purpose and effect of artificially depressing [g]rower compensation below competitive levels. The plaintiffs contend these alleged acts constitute violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act and Section 202 of the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921. The plaintiffs are seeking treble damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, costs, and attorneys fees on behalf of the putative class. Additional named plaintiffs filed similar class action complaints in federal district courts in North Carolina, Colorado, Kansas and California. All actions were subsequently consolidated in the Eastern District of Oklahoma. In June 2021, we reached an agreement to settle with the putative class of broiler chicken farmers all claims raised in this consolidated action on terms not material to the Company for which the Company recorded an accrual in its Consolidated Financial Statements as of October 2, 2021. The Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on August 23, 2021 and final approval on February 18, 2022, and the Company paid the settlement during fiscal 2022. The DOJ s Antitrust Division opened a civil investigation into broiler chicken grower contracts and alleged non-competitive practices involving performance-based compensation sharing for the purpose of stabilizing compensation below competitive levels. We continue to cooperate with the investigation. 
 Pork Antitrust Litigation 
 Beginning June 18, 2018, a series of putative class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our pork subsidiaries, as well as several other pork processing companies, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota styled In re Pork Antitrust Litigation (the Pork Antitrust Civil Litigation ). The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that beginning in January 2009, the defendants conspired and combined to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilize the price of pork and pork products in violation of federal antitrust laws. The complaints on behalf of the putative classes of indirect purchasers also include causes of action under various state unfair competition laws, consumer protection laws, and unjust enrichment common laws. The plaintiffs seek treble damages, injunctive relief, pre- and post-judgment interest, costs, and attorneys fees on behalf of the putative classes. Since the original filing, certain putative class members have opted out of the matter and are proceeding with individual direct actions making similar claims, and others may do so in the future. The Company has not recorded any liability for this matter as it does not believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable because the Company believes that it has valid and meritorious defenses against the allegations. 
 The Offices of the Attorney General in New Mexico and Alaska have filed complaints against us and certain of our pork subsidiaries, as well as several other pork processing companies and Agri Stats. The complaints are based on allegations similar to those asserted in the Pork Antitrust Civil Litigation and allege violations of state antitrust, unfair trade practice, and unjust enrichment laws based on allegations of conspiracies to exchange information and manipulate the supply of pork. The Company has not recorded any liability for the foregoing matters as it does not believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time.

million in damages and fees. From 2004 through 2014, the parties filed numerous appeals, motions for reconsideration and petitions for review, certain of which remained outstanding for several years. On December 15, 2016, we learned that the NLRC rendered its decision on November 29, 2016, regarding the respondents appeals from the labor arbiter s 2004 ruling in favor of the complainants. The NLRC increased the award for of the total complainants to approximately million. However, the NLRC approved a prior settlement reached with the group comprising approximately of the class of complainants, pursuant to which The Hillshire Brands Company agreed to pay each settling complainant approximately . The parties filed numerous appeals, motions for reconsideration and petitions for review related to the NLRC award and settlement payment. The Court of Appeals subsequently vacated the NLRC s award on April 12, 2018. Complainants have filed motions for reconsideration with the Court of Appeals which were denied. Claimants have since filed petitions for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the Philippines, which has accepted. The Company continues to maintain an accrual for estimated probable losses for this matter in the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Various claims have been asserted against the Company, its subsidiaries, and its officers and agents by, and on behalf of, team members who claim to have contracted COVID-19 in our facilities. The Company has not recorded any liability for these matters as it does not believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time because it believes the allegations in the claims are without merit.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Tyson Foods, Inc. 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tyson Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, including the related notes and the schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 appearing under Item 15 (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Third and Fourth Quarter Interim Goodwill Impairment Assessments Certain Reporting Units in the Chicken, Beef and Pork Segments and in International/Other 
 As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s consolidated goodwill balance was 9,878 million as of September 30, 2023, which included 3,064 million, 343 million, 423 million and 144 million for reporting units in the Chicken, Beef and Pork segments and in International/Other, respectively. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If it is determined, based on qualitative factors, the fair value of the reporting unit may more likely than not be less than carrying amount, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. Management estimates the fair value of reporting units considering the use of various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being an income approach (discounted cash flow method) and another technique being a market approach (guideline public company method). The determination of fair value using these techniques includes assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, discount rates and valuation multiples which consider budgets, business plans, economic projections and marketplace data. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company experienced lower than anticipated operating results and changing market fundamentals, as well as a drop in its market capitalization to below book value. Consequently, management performed an interim assessment of goodwill and recorded a 448 million goodwill impairment charge, of which 210 million and 238 million was recognized in the Chicken segment and International/Other, respectively. Management performed its annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter in fiscal 2023, and it did not result in an additional goodwill impairment. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, long-term treasury rates increased, which caused an increase in the discount rates used in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Consequently, management determined it was necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for the Beef, Pork and two of the Chicken segment reporting units as of September 30, 2023, and management recognized a 333 million goodwill impairment charge related to the Beef reporting unit. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the third and fourth quarter interim goodwill impairment assessments of certain reporting units in the Chicken, Beef and Pork segments and in International/Other is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of the reporting units; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to (a) for the third quarter interim impairment assessment: sales growth, operating margins, and discount rates used in the discounted cash flow method for the Beef, Pork and certain Chicken and International/Other reporting units, and valuation multiples used in the guideline public company method for certain Chicken and International/Other reporting units and (b) for the fourth quarter interim impairment assessment: operating margins and discount rates used in the discounted cash flow method for the Beef reporting unit; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of the Company s controls relating to management s third and fourth quarter interim goodwill impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of certain reporting units in the Chicken, Beef and Pork segments and in International/Other. These procedures also included, among others, as applicable to the reporting units and interim impairment assessments described above, (i) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimates of certain reporting units in the Chicken, Beef and Pork segments and in International/Other; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income and market valuation approaches, as applicable; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the valuation approaches; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management s significant assumptions related to sales growth, operating margins, discount rates and valuation multiples, as applicable. Evaluating management s assumptions related to sales growth, operating margins, discount rates and valuation multiples involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting units; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company s valuation approaches and (ii) the reasonableness of the sales growth, discount rates and valuation multiples significant assumptions, as applicable to the reporting units and interim impairment assessments described above.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation was performed, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and the Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act )). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the 1934 Act. Our internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, we used criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO, management concluded the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023.

Tyson Foods, Inc. Securities Trading Policy Publication Date 06 22 2023 
 1.0 Policy Overview 
 1.1. The purpose of this policy is to assist directors and Team Members in complying with insider trading laws under federal and other applicable securities laws and to prevent directors and Team Members from performing any illegal use or exchange of information about our company or any other company, including our customers, suppliers, and business partners that one could reasonably expect to affect the price of the securities of such companies. Terms appearing in bold are defined in Section 7 of this policy. 
 2.0 Scope 
 2.1. This policy applies to all directors and Team Members . 
 3.0 Statements of Policy 
 3.1. If any director or Team Member has material non-public information obtained in the course of employment relating to our company or any other company with publicly-traded securities, including our customers, suppliers or business partners, neither that director or Team Member nor any member of that person s immediate family sharing the same household or entities under any of a foregoing person s influence or control, may buy or sell securities of our company or such other company or engage in any other action to take advantage of, or pass on, that information to another party not otherwise within the scope of this policy. 
 3.1.1. Information relating to our company includes information relating to commodities that are purchased, sold or hedged in our business. Directors and Team Members and any members of their immediate families sharing the same household are prohibited from buying or selling any such commodities and any financial or derivative instruments that relate to such commodities while in possession of material non-public information relating to such commodities. 
 3.2. In the event our company makes a public disclosure of material non-public information, directors, senior officers and designated Team Members may not engage in any transaction in our company s securities, and, if applicable, any commodities to which such material non-public information relates, until one complete trading day after the disclosure has been made i.e. , until one complete trading day has passed after such material non-public information has been released). 
 3.3. Directors, senior officers and designated Team Members may not engage in any transaction of company securities for a period of time beginning on the Monday that is one week prior to the first business day after the end of a fiscal quarter until one trading day has passed after disclosure has been made (in this case, the earnings for the prior fiscal quarter have been released). For example, if earnings are released before the market opens on Monday, such person may trade Tuesday morning if earnings are released on Monday after the market opens, such person may not trade until Wednesday morning. The time period in which these transactions are prohibited is often referred to as a blackout period. 
 3.4. Directors, officers and designated Team Members are prohibited from engaging in any hedging transactions with respect to the company's securities. 

3.5. Directors and senior officers may not engage in any transaction in our company s securities (including transferring securities from one account controlled by such Director or senior officer to another account (or to a trust) controlled by such Director or senior officer , even if there is no subsequent or related sale of our company s equity securities involved in connection with such transfer), hold our securities in a margin account or pledge our company s securities as collateral without pre-clearance of the transaction from the general counsel or other designated persons in the company s Law Department. In addition, directors, senior officers, and any Team Members that are reporting persons under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 must immediately report to the general counsel or other designated persons in the company s Law Department all transactions made in our securities by such person, any family members and any entities that such person controls subject to this policy. 
 3.6. A Team Member s failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment for cause, whether or not the Team Member received any benefit. 
 3.6.1. Twenty-Twenty Hindsight . If a transaction involving company securities becomes the subject of scrutiny, the transaction will be viewed after-the-fact with the benefit of hindsight. As a result, before engaging in any transaction, carefully consider how regulators and others might view the transaction with the benefit of hindsight. 
 3.6.2. Transactions by Family Members and Related Entities . Directors and Team Members are responsible under this policy for their immediate family members sharing the same household and any entities under any of a foregoing person s influence or control. 
 
 3.7. Every senior officer shall review on a regular basis those Team Members that report directly or indirectly to such senior officer and determine which, if any, should be identified as a designated Team Member and report those so identified to the Law Department. Failure of a senior officer to identify a designated Team Member and notify the Law Department may result in disciplinary action for the senior officer. 
 4.0 Responsibilities 
 4.1. All directors and Team Members must comply with the Statement of Policy. 
 4.2. Directors , officers , and designated Team Members must comply with annual certification and training requirements. 
 5.0 Special Circumstances 
 5.1. The trading prohibitions and restrictions set forth in this policy do not apply to purchases under the Tyson Foods, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (or any successor or replacement plan). Team Members , however, may not change participation levels in such plan, or make discretionary transfers of company securities in such plans (a) while in possession of material non-public information , (b) during a blackout period, or (c) when otherwise prohibited by this policy from trading in company securities. 

5.2. The trading prohibitions and restrictions of this policy do not apply to the exercise of company stock options if the exercise price is paid in cash to the company and the Team Member receives the requisite number of shares of company stock pursuant to the terms of the option (provided, that the company may withhold a portion of the shares underlying the options to satisfy tax withholding requirements). However, the trading prohibitions and restrictions of this policy do apply to (i) sales of the underlying stock following the option exercise and (ii) any broker-assisted cashless exercise of options that requires a sale into the market to generate proceeds for the exercise price, as well as to any other market sales for the purpose of generating the cash needed to cover the costs of exercise. 
 5.3. The trading prohibitions and restrictions of this policy do not apply when a Team Member is prohibited from trading due to a blackout period (scheduled pursuant to Section 3.3 or otherwise) the day stock options held by such Team Member are scheduled to expire (and if such day is not a business day, on the business day prior to the scheduled expiration). In such event, without any further action by the Team Member , such stock options shall automatically be exercised on such date in a cashless exercise where the underlying stock is withheld by the Company based on the market price of company stock at or about noon Central time on that date and the value of such withholding shall offset the exercise price and any required withholding taxes, and any remaining value shall be distributed to the Team Member . The foregoing assumes the noon Central time market price of the company s stock on that date is greater than the exercise price of the applicable stock options. If the exercise price of the applicable stock options at or about noon Central on that date is greater than the market price of the company s stock, then the stock options will expire as otherwise scheduled in the pertinent grant document. 
 5.4. The company s general counsel or other designated persons in the company s Law Department may, on a case-by-case basis, authorize transactions in company securities outside the applicable trading windows due to hardships for directors or Team Members or their immediate family members sharing the same household but only if (i) the director or Team Member who wishes to engage in a transaction has notified the company s general counsel or other designated persons in the company s Law Department prior to the trade in writing of the circumstances of the hardship and the amount and nature of the proposed transaction(s) and (ii) the person trading is not in possession of material non-public information concerning the company and has certified that fact in writing to the company s general counsel or other designated persons in the company s Law Department. 
 5.5. Directors and Team Members may make gifts of company securities to charitable and non-profit organizations at any time. 
 5.6. Except as expressly set forth above, transactions that may be necessary or justifiable for independent reasons (such as the need to raise money for an emergency expenditure) are no exception. Even the appearance of an improper transaction must be avoided to preserve our reputation for adhering to the highest standards of conduct.

 7.2. Frequently Asked Questions 
 7.2.1. Why do we need this policy 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice vigorously pursue violations of insider trading laws. The insider trading laws not only target individuals directly involved in trading abuses, but they also place the onus on companies and possible other controlling persons for violations by company personnel. The purpose of this policy is to promote compliance with applicable securities laws by Tyson Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries and all directors and Team Members. 
 In addition to responding to insider trading laws, this policy was adopted to avoid even the appearance of improper conduct on the part of anyone employed by or associated with our company (not just so- called insiders ). The company works hard to maintain its reputation for integrity and ethical conduct and cannot afford to have it damaged. 
 7.2.2. What are the legal consequences of insider trading violations 
 For individuals who trade on material non-public information (or tip information to others) 
 Disgorgement of the profit or loss avoided 
 A civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided 
 A criminal fine (no matter how small the profit) of up to 5 million and 
 Jail time of up to twenty years. 
 For a company (as well as possibly any supervisory person) that fails to take appropriate steps to prevent illegal trading 
 A civil penalty of the greater of 1,000,000 or three times the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of the Team Member s violations and 
 A criminal penalty of up to 25 million. 
 Moreover, if a Team Member violates our insider trading policy, company-imposed sanctions, including termination of employment for cause, could result. Needless to say, any of the above consequences, even an SEC investigation that does not result in prosecution can tarnish one s reputation and damage a career. 
 7.2.3. Whom should I contact if I have questions or need to seek pre-clearance for a transaction 
 Any person who has any questions about specific transactions (including pre-clearance) may obtain additional guidance from our company s general counsel or other designated persons in the company s Law Department. The Law Department will endeavor to promptly respond to all inquiries. Remember, however, the ultimate responsibility for 

adhering to this policy and avoiding improper transactions rests with the Team Member . In this regard, it is imperative that all Team Members use their best judgment. 
 7.2.4. What are some examples of material information 
 In short, any information which could reasonably affect the price of the stock, whether it be of our company or another company. Common examples of information that will frequently be regarded as material are projections of future earnings or losses news of a pending or proposed merger, acquisition, tender offer or joint venture news of a significant sale of assets or the disposition of a subsidiary changes in dividend policies or the declaration of a stock split or the offering of additional securities significant litigation or government agency investigations significant write-offs or significant increases in reserves changes in senior management significant new products or discoveries impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems and the gain or loss of a substantial customer or supplier. Either positive or negative information may be considered material. 
 7.2.5. When is material information considered public information 
 One common misconception is that material information loses its non-public status as soon as a press release is issued disclosing the information. In fact, information is considered to be available to the public only when it has been released broadly to the marketplace (such as by a press release or an SEC filing) and the investing public has had time to absorb the information fully. 
 7.2.6. What is a trading window 
 This term is not used in our policy however, trading window generally refers to a period of time when Team Members or subsets of Team Members are permitted to engage in transactions of our company s securities. 
 7.2.7. Do these policy restrictions apply to an individual living in my household who is not an immediate family member 
 These policy restrictions do not specifically apply to an individual living in your household who is not an immediate family member however, all persons are prohibited by law from effecting a securities transaction while in possession of material non-public information about the company in whose securities they are trading

Exhibit 97 

 Recovery Events 
 
 A. Miscalculation of Financial Reporting Measure Results Constituting a Restatement Event 
 
 This Policy shall be triggered as to all Subject Employees if a Restatement Event occurs. Subject to the Policy s enforcement provisions and in compliance with the Clawback Rules, in the event of a Restatement Event, the Company shall seek to recover an amount equal to the Excess Incentive Compensation related to the applicable performance period(s) to which the Restatement Event relates reasonably promptly after the Company discovers that such a recovery is owed pursuant to this Policy. 
 
 For purposes of this Part A, Incentive Compensation is related to a Restatement Event if the Incentive Compensation relates to any portion of the Lookback Period, regardless of the timing of payment, distribution or exercise of any award. 
 
 To the extent Excess Incentive Compensation relates to awards that are unpaid or unvested, the Company shall cancel such unpaid or unvested awards of Incentive Compensation in an amount equal to the Excess Incentive Compensation related to such awards. 
 
 B. Improper Conduct 
 
 If the CLDC concludes that a Subject Employee has engaged in Improper Conduct, and that such Improper Conduct occurred during the Lookback Period, subject to the enforcement provisions of the Policy, the Company shall seek recovery of any amount of Incentive Compensation paid with respect to the Recovery Period. To the extent Recoverable Incentive Compensation relates to awards that are unpaid or unvested, the Company shall cancel such unpaid or unvested awards of Incentive Compensation in an amount equal to the Recoverable Incentive Compensation related to such awards. 
 
 In each such instance of Improper Conduct, the amount required to be returned, repaid or forfeited by the Subject Employee shall be determined by the CLDC. A recovery or forfeiture under these circumstances may be effected even if the Improper Conduct did not result in an award or payment greater than what would have been awarded or paid absent the Improper Conduct. 
 
 Enforcement 
 
 In pursuing the enforcement of Part A of the Recovery Events section of this Policy, and in accordance with any applicable laws or regulations requiring the recovery of any amount of Incentive Compensation, including the Clawback Rules, the CLDC will consider whether recovery of any Excess Incentive Compensation would be impracticable, which for purposes of this Policy means that 
 
 (a) the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy against a Subject Employee would exceed the amount to be recovered, after the Company has made a reasonable attempt to recover the applicable Excess Incentive Compensation, documented such reasonable attempt(s) and provided such documentation to the New York Stock Exchange 
 (b) the recovery would violate any applicable law that was adopted prior to November 28, 2022, provided that the Company has obtained an opinion of local counsel, acceptable to the New York Stock Exchange, that recovery would result in such a violation and a copy of such opinion is provided to the New York Stock Exchange or 
 (c) the recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. 

Exhibit 97 

 In pursuing the enforcement of Part B of the Recovery Events section of this Policy, and in accordance with any applicable laws or regulation requiring the recovery of any amount of Incentive Compensation, the CLDC will consider 
 
 (a) the nature, extent, and egregiousness of any Improper Conduct 
 (b) the financial and reputational harm caused to Tyson resulting from such Improper Conduct 
 (c) whether asserting a claim against the Subject Employee may violate any applicable law or prejudice Tyson s interests in any way 
 (d) whether the cost and administrative burden of attempting to recover any amount of Incentive Compensation is likely to exceed the amount to be recovered and 
 (e) any other factors it deems relevant to the determination. 
 The CLDC shall seek to recover any Excess Incentive Compensation or Recoverable Incentive Compensation, as applicable, owed by a Subject Employee through one or more of the following methods, as selected by the CLDC and subject to applicable law, including Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Clawback Rules 
 
 (a) reimbursement of the amount of an affected cash payment received as Incentive Compensation 
 
 (b) recovery of shares, or an equivalent cash value as of the date the Subject Employee constructively receives such award (e.g., date of settlement or delivery of shares under a restricted stock unit award, exercise of a nonqualified stock option or SAR, etc.), of any affected equity-based award received as Incentive Compensation 
 
 (c) offset of the Incentive Compensation from any compensation otherwise owed to the Subject Employee by Tyson 
 
 (d) cancellation of an affected equity award received as Incentive Compensation, whether vested or unvested or 
 
 (e) any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law. 
 
 The CLDC shall reasonably promptly seek recovery of Excess Incentive Compensation or Recoverable Incentive Compensation, as applicable, by first making a written demand for repayment from the Subject Employee and, if the individual does not tender timely repayment in response to such demand, the CLDC shall then pursue the other remedies contemplated by the Policy, including seeking a court order against the individual for such repayment. 
 
 The CLDC shall make a reasonable determination of the amount of any Excess Incentive Compensation or Recoverable Incentive Compensation, as applicable, subject to recovery or cancellation under this Policy. For example, where the recovery is triggered by the adjustment of a Financial Reporting Measure that has been established on a formulaic basis, the Company shall seek to recover, at the direction of the CLDC, any amount awarded or paid in excess of the amount that would have been paid based on the correctly calculated Financial Reporting Measure result. Where the matter is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information adjusted, the CLDC shall seek to recover the amount, if any, by which the payment or award should have been reduced as a result of such adjustment, based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement on the applicable Financial Reporting Measure result. In making a determination of the amount of any Excess Incentive Compensation or Recoverable Incentive Compensation, as applicable, attributable to equity-based awards, the amount of Incentive Compensation considered to be received by a Subject Employee shall be determined on the basis of the value of each such equity-based award at the time the Subject Employee constructively receives such award (e.g., date of settlement or delivery of shares under a restricted stock unit award, exercise of a nonqualified stock option or SAR, etc.), whether such award has vested in full or in part. 

Exhibit 97 

The amount of any Incentive Compensation subject to recovery shall be determined without regard to any taxes paid, or other amounts withheld, from the wages of the Subject Employee on such Incentive Compensation. 
 
 Reporting and Disclosure 
 
 The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of U.S. federal securities laws, including any disclosure required by applicable SEC rules. 
 
 No Indemnification 
 
 The Company shall not indemnify any Subject Employee against the loss of any Incentive Compensation effected pursuant to this Policy and or pursuant to the Clawback Rules, including any payment or reimbursement for the cost of third-party insurance purchased by any Subject Employee to cover any such loss under this Policy and or pursuant to the Clawback Rules. Further, the Company shall not enter into any agreement that exempts any Excess Incentive Compensation from the application of this Policy or the Clawback Rules or that waives the Company s right to recovery of any Excess Incentive Compensation, and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered into before, on or after the Effective Date). Any purported indemnification shall be null and void ab initio . 
 
 Amendment or Termination 
 
 The CLDC may amend or terminate this Policy from time to time in its discretion, including as required to comply with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange implementing Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Any such amendments shall be binding on awards or grants of Incentive Compensation made after the effective date of such amendment(s). No such amendments may be given a retroactive effective date. 
 
 Other Recoupment Rights 
 
 The CLDC intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The CLDC may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement entered into on or after the Effective Date expressly require a Subject Employee to abide by the terms of this Policy however, the absence of any such express provision in any such agreement shall not prevent application of the Policy to Subject Employees. Any right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to Tyson pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement or any other legal remedies available to Tyson. 
 
 Non-Exclusivity of Remedies 
 
 Application of the Policy does not preclude the Company from taking any other action to enforce a Subject Employee s obligations to Tyson, including termination of employment or institution of civil or criminal proceedings or any other remedies that may be available to Tyson with respect to inappropriate conduct on the part of the Subject Employee. 

Exhibit 97 

 Interpretation and Non-Exclusivity of Policy 
 The CLDC is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Clawback Rules. The terms of this Policy shall also be construed and enforced in such a manner as to comply with applicable law, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and any other law or regulation that the CLDC determines is applicable. In the event any provision of this Policy is determined to be unenforceable or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be applied to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the extent necessary to conform to any limitations required by applicable law. The terms of this Policy are in addition to any recoupment required or permitted by contract or by law. 
 
 Beneficiaries and Representatives 
 
 The Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Subject Employees and their beneficiaries, estates, executors, administrators, and other legal representatives.
