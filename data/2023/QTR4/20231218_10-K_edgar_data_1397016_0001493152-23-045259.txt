Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K by Optex Systems Holdings, Inc. Optex Systems Holdings, the Company, we, 
 us, or our ), in particular Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the Exchange Act ). Any statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not statements of historical
fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10- K and other reports, statements, and
information we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Commission or SEC ), in our press releases,
presentations to securities analysts or investors, or in oral statements made by or with the approval of an executive officer, the words
or phrases believes, may, will, expects, should, continue, 
 anticipates, intends, will likely result, estimates, projects or
similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. 

These
forward-looking statements represent our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies concerning future events, including, but not
limited to, any statements regarding our growth strategy; product and development programs; financial performance and financial condition
(including revenue, net income, profit margins and working capital); orders and backlog; expected timing of contract deliveries to customers
and corresponding revenue recognition; increases in the cost of materials and labor; costs remaining to fulfill contracts; contract loss
reserves; labor shortages; follow-on orders; supply chain challenges; the continuation of historical trends; the sufficiency of our cash
balances for future liquidity and capital resource needs; the expected impact of changes in accounting policies on our results of operations,
financial condition or cash flows; anticipated problems and our plans for future operations; and the economy in general or the future
of the defense industry. 

We
caution that these statements by their nature involve risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control, and actual results
may differ materially depending on a variety of important factors. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, continued
funding of defense programs and military spending, the timing of such funding, general economic and business conditions, including unforeseen
weakness in the Company s markets, effects of continued geopolitical unrest and regional conflicts, competition, changes in technology
and methods of marketing, delays in completing engineering and manufacturing programs, changes in customer order patterns, changes in
product mix, continued success in technological advances and delivering technological innovations, changes in the U.S. Government s
interpretation of federal procurement rules and regulations, changes in spending due to policy changes in any new federal presidential
administration, market acceptance of the Company s products, shortages in components, production delays due to performance quality
issues with outsourced components, inability to fully realize the expected benefits from acquisitions and restructurings or delays in
realizing such benefits, challenges in integrating acquired businesses and achieving anticipated synergies, changes to export regulations,
increases in tax rates, changes to generally accepted accounting principles, difficulties in retaining key employees and customers, unanticipated
costs under fixed-price service and system integration engagements, changes in the market for microcap stocks regardless of growth and
value and various other factors beyond our control. Some of these risks and uncertainties are identified in this Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the section Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K and you are urged to review that section. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all
such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete list of all potential risks or uncertainties. 

We
do not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. You should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors
described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item
1. Business 

Current
Lines of Business 

We
manufacture optical sighting systems and assemblies for the U.S. Department of Defense, foreign military applications and commercial
markets. Our products are installed on a variety of U.S. military land vehicles, such as the Abrams and Bradley fighting vehicles, light
armored and advanced security vehicles and the Stryker family of vehicles. We also manufacture and deliver numerous periscope configurations,
rifle and surveillance sights and night vision optical assemblies. Our products consist primarily of build-to-customer print products
that are delivered both directly to the armed services and to other defense prime contractors. Less than 1 of our revenue is related
to the resale of products substantially manufactured by others. In this case, the product would likely be a simple replacement part of
a larger system previously produced by us. 

We
continue to field new product opportunities from both domestic and international customers. We believe that given continuing unrest in
multiple global hot spots, the need for precision optics continues to increase. Most of these requirements are for observation and situational
awareness applications; however, we continue to see requests for higher magnification and custom reticles in various product modifications.
The basic need to protect the soldier while providing information about the mission environment continues to be the primary driver for
these requirements. 

Recent
Events 

May
2023 Grants 

On
May 9, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a grant of 40,000 shares of restricted stock to independent board member Dayton Judd. The
shares vest 50 on each of January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025. As of the grant date, the fair value of the shares was 124 thousand,
to be amortized on a straight-line basis through December 31, 2024. 

On
May 3, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a grant of 100,000 and 35,000 performance shares to Danny Schoening, CEO, and Karen Hawkins,
CFO, respectively. Each performance share represents a contingent right to receive one share of common stock. The performance shares
vest in five equal increments if, in each case and during a five-year performance period beginning on October 2, 2023, the average VWAP
per share of common stock over a 30 consecutive trading day period equals or exceeds 3.70, 4.45, 5.35, 6.40, or 7.70. The fair value
of the shares as of the grant date was 320 thousand and will be amortized through December 31, 2025 based on the derived service periods
using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. On October 2, 2023, 20,000 of Mr. Schoening s performance shares and 7,000 of Ms.
Hawkins performance shares vested, resulting in the net issuance of 15,600 and 5,460 shares of common stock, respectively. 

On
May 1, 2023, the Company granted an aggregate of 39,000 restricted stock units to eleven employees under its 2023 Equity Incentive
Plan. The restricted stock units will vest at a rate of 33.33 annually beginning on the anniversary date of the grant and any
unvested restricted stock units will be forfeited if employment terminates prior to the relevant vesting date. As of the grant date,
assuming a 23.1 forfeiture rate based on expected turnover across the three years, the aggregate value of the restricted stock
units is 90 thousand which will be amortized across the three-year period on a straight-line basis. On August 14, 2023, the Company
granted an additional 3,000 restricted stock units to one new employee under the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. The restricted stock
units will vest at a rate of 33.33 annually beginning on the anniversary date of the grant and any unvested restricted stock units
will be forfeited if employment terminates prior to the relevant vesting date. The fair value of the 3,000 restricted stock units at
grant date was 11 thousand. During the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, there were 3,000 restricted stock units
forfeited.

New
Loan Agreement 

On
March 22, 2023, the Company and its subsidiary, Optex Systems, Inc. (collectively with the Company, the Borrowers ), entered
into a Business Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement with Texas Capital Bank (the Lender ), pursuant to which
the Lender will make available to the Borrowers a revolving line of credit in the principal amount of 3 million (the Texas Capital
Facility ). The Texas Capital Facility replaced the Borrowers previous line of credit facility with PNC Bank, National Association,
successor to BBVA USA, which had been increased from 1.125 million to 2 million on November 21, 2022. 

The
commitment period for advances under the Texas Capital Facility is twenty-six months expiring on May 22, 2025. We refer to the expiration
of that time period as the Maturity Date. Outstanding advances under the Texas Capital Facility will accrue interest at
a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus a specified margin, subject to a specified floor interest rate. As of
October 1, 2023 the interest rate was 8.07 per annum and is currently 8.08 per annum. 

The
Loan Agreement contains customary events of default (including a 25 change in ownership) and negative covenants, including but not limited
to those governing indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes (including changes in management), investments, and restricted payments (including
cash dividends). The Loan Agreement also requires the Borrowers to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1 and a total
leverage ratio of 3.00:1. The Texas Capital Facility is secured by substantially all of the operating assets of the Borrowers as collateral.
The Borrowers obligations under the Texas Capital Facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default
as defined in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement further provides for a 125,000 Letter of Credit sublimit. 

The
outstanding balance under the Texas Capital Facility was 1.0 million as of October 1, 2023.

Contracts 

Some
of our contracts may allow for government contract financing in the form of contract progress payments pursuant to Federal Acquisition
Regulation 52.232-16, Progress Payments . Subject to certain limitations, this clause provides for government payment of
up to 90 of incurred program costs prior to product delivery for small businesses like us. To the extent any contracts allow for progress
payments and the respective contracts would result in significant preproduction cash requirements for design, process development, tooling,
material or other resources which could exceed our current working capital or line of credit availability, we intend to utilize this
benefit to minimize any potential negative impact on working capital prior to receipt of payment for the associated contract deliveries. 

Our
government contracts allow for Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.243-1 which entitles the contractor to an equitable adjustment 
for contract or statement of work changes eaffecting cost or time of performance. In essence, an equitable price adjustment request is
a request for a contract price modification (generally an increase) that allows for the contractor to be made whole for
additional costs incurred which were necessitated by some modification of the contract effort. This modification may come from an overt
change in U.S. Government requirements or scope, or it may come from a change in the conditions surrounding the contract (e.g., differing
site conditions or late delivery of U.S. Government-furnished property) which result in statement of work additions, deletions, part
substitutions, schedule or other changes to the contract which impact the contractor s overall cost to complete. 

Each
contract with our customers has specific quantities of material that need to be purchased, assembled, and then shipped. Prior to bidding
for a contract, we contact potential sources of material and receive qualified quotations for each material. In some cases, the entire
volume is given to a single supplier and in other cases, the volume might be split between several suppliers. If a contract has a single
source supplier and that supplier fails to meet their obligations (e.g., quality, delivery), then we would attempt to find an acceptable
alternate supplier, and if successful, we would then renegotiate contractual deliverables (e.g., specifications, delivery or price).
As of December 6, 2023, approximately 9 of our material requirements are single-sourced across 13 suppliers representing approximately
27 of our active supplier order values. Single-sourced component requirements span across all of our major product lines. Of these single-sourced components, we have material contracts (purchase orders) with firm pricing and delivery schedules in place with each of the suppliers
to supply the parts necessary to satisfy our current contractual needs. See Item 1.A. Risk Factors Risks Relating to
Our Business Certain of our products are dependent on specialized sources of supply potentially subject to disruption which could
have a material, adverse impact on our business for a description of certain supplier risks we face, which description is
incorporated herein by reference. 

Approximately
92 of our contracts contain termination clauses for convenience. In the event these clauses should be invoked by our customer, future
revenues against these contracts could be affected. However, these clauses allow for a full recovery of any incurred contract costs plus
a reasonable fee up through and as a result of the contract termination. We are currently unaware of any pending terminations on our
existing contracts. 

7 

In
some cases, contract awards may be issued that are subject to renegotiation at a date (up to 180 days) subsequent to the initial award
date. Generally, these subsequent negotiations have had an immaterial impact (zero to 5 on the contract price of the affected contracts.
Currently, none of our awarded contracts are subject to renegotiation. 

We
are subject to, and must comply with, various governmental regulations that impact, among other things, our revenue, operating costs,
profit margins and the internal organization and operation of our business. The material regulations affecting our U.S. government business
are summarized in the table below. 

Regulation 
 
 Summary 

Federal
 Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
 
 The
 principal set of rules in the Federal Acquisition Regulation System. This system consists of sets of regulations issued by agencies
 of the federal government of the United States to govern what is called the acquisition process, which is the process
 through which the government acquires goods and services. That process consists of three phases: (1) need recognition and acquisition
 planning, (2) contract formation, and (3) contract administration. This system regulates the activities of government personnel in
 carrying out that process. It does not regulate the purchasing activities of private sector firms, except to the extent that those
 activities involve government solicitations and contracts by reference.

 States government regulations that control the export and import of defense-related articles and services on the United States Munitions
 List. These regulations implement the provisions of the Arms Export Control Act. 

Truth
 in Negotiations Act (TINA) 
 
 A
 public law enacted for the purpose of providing for full and fair disclosure by contractors in the conduct of negotiations with the
 government. The most significant provision included is the requirement that contractors submit certified cost and pricing data for
 negotiated procurements above a defined threshold of 2 million for contracts entered into after June, 30, 2018. The law requires
 contractors to provide the government with an extremely broad range of cost or pricing information relevant to the expected costs
 of contract performance, and it requires contractors and subcontractors to submit cost or pricing data to the government and to certify
 that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, the data are current, accurate, and complete. A contracting officer may still request
 cost or price data, if necessary, without certification, to determine whether the proposed cost or price is fair and reasonable for
 contracts which are below the threshold. 

We
are responsible for full compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Upon award, the contract may identify certain regulations
that we need to meet. For example, a contract may allow progress billing pursuant to specific FAR clauses incorporated into the contract.
Other contracts may call for specific first article acceptance and testing requirements. The FAR will identify the specific regulations
that we must follow based on the type of contract awarded and contains guidelines and regulations for managing a contract after award,
including conditions under which contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, at the government s convenience or for default.
These regulations also subject us to financial audits and other reviews by the government of our costs, performance, accounting and general
business practices relating to our government contracts, which may result in adjustment of our contract-related costs and fees and, among
other things and impose accounting rules that define allowable and unallowable costs governing our right to reimbursement under certain
contracts. 

First
Article Acceptance and Testing requirements consist of specific steps which could be comprehensive and time consuming. The
dimensions and material specifications of each piece of the assembly must be verified, and some products may have in excess of 100
assembled parts. Once the individual piece parts are verified to be compliant to the specification, the assembly processes are
documented and verified. A sample of the production (typically three units) is verified to meet final performance specifications.
Once the units meet the final performance specification, they are then subjected to accelerated life testing, a series of tests
which simulate the lifetime use of the product in the field. This consists of exposing the units to thermal extremes, humidity,
mechanical shock, vibration, and other physical exposure tests. Once completed, the units undergo a final verification process to
ensure that no damage has occurred as a result of the testing and that they continue to meet the performance specification. All of
the information and data is recorded into a final first article inspection and test report and submitted to the customer along with
the test units for final approval. First Article Acceptance and Testing is generally required on new contracts/product awards but
may also be required on existing products or contracts where there has been a significant gap in production, or where the product
has undergone significant manufacturing process, material, tooling, equipment or product configuration changes.

We
are also subject to laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information deemed classified for
national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data as covered by the International Traffic in Arms
Regulation (ITAR). In order to import or export items listed on the U.S. Munitions List, we are required to be registered with the Directorate
of Defense Trade Controls office. The registration is valid for one year, and the registration fees are established based on the number
of license applications submitted the previous year. We currently have an approved and current registration on file with the Directorate
of Defense Trade Controls office. Once the registration is approved, each import/export license must be filed separately. License approval
requires the company to provide proof of need, such as a valid contract or purchase order requirement for the specific product or technical
data requested on the license and requires a detailed listing of the items requested for export/import, the end-user, the end-user statement,
the value of the items, consignees/freight forwarders and a copy of a valid contract or purchase order from the end-user. The approval
process for the license can vary from several weeks to six months or more. The licenses we currently use are the Department of State
licenses: DSP-5 (permanent export), DSP-6 (license revisions) and DSP-73 (temporary export) and Department of Commerce: BIS-711 (export). 

The
above licenses are valid for 48 months from date that each license is issued. A summary of our active ITAR licenses is presented below

These
licenses are subject to termination if a licensee is found to be in violation of the Arms Export Control Act or the ITAR requirements.
If a licensee is found to be in violation, in addition to a termination of its licenses, it can be subject to fines and penalties by
the government. 

Our
contracts may also be governed by the Truth in Negotiation Act (TINA) requirements where certain of our contracts or proposals exceed
the TINA threshold 2 million for awards after June 30, 2018), and/or are deemed as sole source, or non-competitive awards, covered
under this act. For these contracts, we must provide a vast array of cost and pricing data in addition to certification that our pricing
data and disclosure materials are current, accurate and complete upon conclusion of the negotiation. Due to the additional disclosure
and certification requirements, if a post contract award audit were to uncover that the pricing data provided was in any way not current,
accurate or complete as of the certification date, we could be subjected to a defective pricing claim adjustment with accrued interest.
We have no history of defective pricing claim adjustments and have no outstanding defective pricing claims pending. Additionally, as
a result of this requirement, contract price negotiations may span from two to six months and can result in undefinitized or not to exceed
ceiling priced contracts subject to future downward negotiations and price adjustments. Currently, we do not have any undefinitized contracts
subject to further price negotiation. 

Our
failure to comply with applicable regulations, rules and approvals or misconduct by any of our employees could result in the imposition
of fines and penalties, the loss of security clearances, the loss of our U.S. government contracts or our suspension or debarment from
contracting with the U.S. government generally, any of which could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows. We are currently in compliance with all applicable regulations and do not have any pending claims
as a result of noncompliance.

During
the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, approximately 74 of our business was in support of U.S. military products. The chart below
was derived from public government spending sources and depicts total U.S. military spending from 2018 through 2023 and estimated spending
through 2028. The purpose of including this chart is to provide the reader with historical trend data and projected U.S. military defense
and procurement spending over time. For fiscal year 2024, the total projected military spending is estimated at 863 billion, an overall
increase of 11.9 over estimated 2023 spending. The chart below also depicts increased spending through 2028 of 6.1 from the 2024 plan
level, reflecting an average increase of 1.5 per year for years 2025 through 2028. Military procurement spending, a subset of total
military spending, depicts an overall increase of 15.3 billion, or 10.8 , in fiscal year 2024 as compared to the estimated spending
in fiscal year 2023. 

The
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2024 was enacted by Congress in December 2023 for 886 billion, an increase
of 28 billion, or 3 over the prior year NDAA. The 2024 NDAA includes DOD military procurement of 169 billion, 8 above the Department
of Defense procurement budget request of 156.4 billion. The Chart below depicts the original estimated funding levels from the U.S.
Department of Defense based on the FY2024 budget request.

The
table below depicts the U.S. Department of Defense budget request for fiscal year 2024 for major ground system programs. The last five
years have experienced a significant reduction in spending for U.S ground system military programs, and more specifically on the Abrams
Tank Modifications/Upgrades, which has a direct impact on the Optex Systems Richardson segment revenue. The total fiscal year 2024 budget
request for major ground system programs decreased by 2.3 from the fiscal year 2023 levels and by 10.8 from the fiscal year 2020 levels.
Although it is difficult to directly tie the budget request to specific components provided by Optex Systems, we provide periscopes,
collimator assemblies, vision blocks and laser interface filters to the U.S. armed forces on almost all of the ground system platforms
categorized below.

2024 appropriation budget years. There is generally a six- to eighteen-month delay between U.S. defense budget requests and program delivery
orders related to our products from government agencies and our prime defense customers. In addition, DoD budget requests are often changed
throughout the congressional NDAA Budgeting and Budget appropriations process. The DoD budget requests exclude any foreign military sales
as they are funded separately from the annual NDAA budgets. We are carefully watching the projected trends in both DoD military spending
and FMS as defense allocation priorities change, as well as challenges which are presented from the global recession and changes in political
climate to ascertain any potential impact to the Company s future revenue. 

The
Applied Optics Center supports numerous other military platforms outside of the ground system vehicles budget, such as infantry rifle
scopes, night vision monoculars, infantry and navy binoculars, night goggles, and infrared aircraft filters. The Applied Optics Center
has seen a substantial increase in orders from new and existing customers in support of the other platforms, which we expect to offset
the impact of the ground systems reductions to their base revenue. 

Market
Opportunity Foreign Military 

Our
products directly support FMS combat vehicles globally, including Canada, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Morocco, Egypt, South
America, and Israel. We have increased efforts to promote our proven military products, as well as newly improved product solutions directly
to foreign military representatives and domestic defense contractors supporting the FMS initiatives. 

We
were successful with the Israeli Ministry of Defense (IMOD) in refurbishing a small quantity of their Night Vision Rifle Scopes. Given
this success, in November 2022, the IMOD awarded us a 3.4 million follow on contract to continue this activity. We anticipate deliveries
against the contract to begin during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. If we successfully execute this contract, we would expect
another contract award of similar size and duration. 

15 

We
are also exploring possibilities to adapt some of our products for commercial use in those markets that demonstrate potential for solid
revenue growth, both domestically and internationally. 

Market
Opportunity Commercial 

Our
products are currently sold to military and related government markets. We believe there may be opportunities to commercialize various
products we presently manufacture to address other markets. Our initial focus will be directed in three product areas. 

Big
 Eye Binoculars While the military application we produce is based on mature military designs, we own all castings, tooling
 and glass technology. These large fixed mount binoculars could be sold to cruise ships, personal yachts and cities/municipalities.
 The binoculars are also applicable to fixed, land-based outposts for private commercial security as well as border patrols and regional
 law enforcement. 

Thin
 Film Coatings The acquisition of the Applied Optics Center (AOC) also creates a new sector of opportunity for commercial
 products for us. Globally, commercial optical products use thin film coatings to create product differentiation. These coatings can
 be used for redirecting light (mirrors), blocking light (laser protection), absorbing select light (desired wavelengths), and many
 other combinations. They are used in telescopes, rifle scopes, binoculars, microscopes, range finders, protective eyewear, photography,
 etc. Given this broad potential, the commercial applications are a key opportunity going forward. 

Optical
 Assemblies Through the Applied Optics Center, we are utilizing our experience in military sighting systems to pursue commercial
 opportunities associated with products that incorporate multi-lens optical cell assemblies, bonded optical elements and mechanical
 assemblies. There are a wide variety of products in the medical, machine vision, automotive and outdoor recreation fields that can
 benefit from our capabilities. Support to domestic customers for these type products has driven significant increases in Applied
 Optics Segment sales during the last five years. 

Customer
Base 

We
serve customers in four primary categories: as prime defense contractor (Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Land and Maritime, DLA Warren,
DLA Aviation, U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps), as defense subcontractor (General Dynamics, L-3 Communications, Elbit Systems, BAE,
Sig Sauer, Enterprise Cabling and Vortex Optics), as a military supplier to foreign governments (Israel, Australia, South America and
Canada) and also as a commercial optical assembly supplier (Nightforce Optics, Gables Engineering, Amazon). During the twelve months
ended October 1, 2023, we derived approximately 72 of our gross business revenue from five major customers: U.S. government agencies
(22 ), three U.S. defense contractors (14 , 7 , and 6 and one major commercial customer (23 ). We have approximately 151 discrete contracts
for items that are utilized in vehicles, optical product lines and as spare parts. Due to the high percentage of prime and subcontracted
U.S. defense revenues, large customer size and the fact that there are multiple contracts with each entity, which are not interdependent,
we are of the opinion that this provides us with a fairly well diversified revenue pool. 

Marketing
Plan 

We
believe we are well positioned to service both U.S. and foreign military needs by our focus on delivering products that satisfy the following
factors important to the U.S. military : 

Product
 reliability failure can cost lives 

Speed
 to delivery and adherence to delivery schedule 

System
 life cycle extension 

Low
 cost/best value 

Visual
 aids for successful execution of mission objectives 

Mission
 critical products specifically related to soldier safety. 

16 

Potential
Entrants Low Risk to us. In order to enter this market, potential competitors must overcome several barriers to entry. The first
hurdle is that an entrant would need to prove to the government agency in question the existence of a government approved accounting
system for larger contracts. Second, the entrant would need to develop the processes required to produce the product. Third, the entrant
would then need to produce the product and submit successful test requirements (many of which require lengthy government consultation
for completion). Finally, in many cases, the customer has an immediate need and therefore cannot wait for this qualification cycle and
therefore must issue the contracts to existing suppliers. Given the expense of development and qualification testing, the barrier to
entry is high for new competitors. 

Buyers
 Medium Risk to us. In most cases the buyers (usually government agencies or defense contractors) have two fairly strong suppliers.
It is in their best interest to keep at least two, and therefore, in some cases, the contracts are split between suppliers. In the case
of larger contracts, the customer can request an open book policy on costs and expects a reasonable margin to have been applied. 

Substitutes
 Low Risk to us. We have both new vehicle contracts and replacement part contracts for the same product. Three combat vehicles
have a long history of service in the U.S. Army. The first M-1 Abrams Tank entered service with the Army in 1980; the M-2/M-3 Bradley
Fighting Vehicle in 1981; and the Stryker Combat Vehicle in 2001. Under current Army modernization plans, the Army envisions all three
vehicles in service with Active and National Guard forces beyond FY2028. Optex Systems provides periscopes and optical sighting systems
in support of all three vehicle platforms. Since it was first fielded in 1980, the Abrams tank has undergone near-continuous upgrades
and improvements; however, as illustrated above, spending on modifications and upgrades of the Abrams tank by the U.S. military has significantly
decreased in the past five years and we expect this trend to continue. The Abrams is the principal battle tank of the United States Army
and Marine Corps, and the armies of Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and since 2007, Australia. On average, there has been a new improvement
package every seven years. The Army is currently upgrading the Abrams with a System Enhancement Package Version 3 (SEPv3), with additional
upgrades in development. Additionally, the US Army has announced contracts to produce 742 Stryker DVH vehicles, redesigned (dual v-hulled
vehicles) to be more resistant to land mines, as retrofits and as new production vehicles. The Abrams, Bradley and Striker vehicles are
the only production tanks currently in production by the government. We believe that this, in conjunction with the 30-year life span,
supports our expectation that they will continue to be used through approximately 2040. 

17 

Suppliers
 Low to Medium Risk to Optex Systems Holdings. The suppliers of standard processes (e.g., casting, machining and plating) need
to be very competitive to gain and/or maintain contracts. Those suppliers of products that use top secret clearance processes have a
slight advantage; however, there continues to be multiple avenues of supply and therefore only moderate power. 

Consistent
with our marketing plan and business model, the AOC acquisition strengthened our overall position by decreasing the bargaining power
of their suppliers through the backwards integration of a key supplier and created additional barriers of entry for potential competitors. 

The
following matrix reflects the current focus of our four basic approaches for sales and development: 

1) 
 Sell
 existing products to existing customers. 

2) 
 Sell
 existing products to new customers. 

3) 
 Develop
 new products to meet the needs of our existing customers. 

4) 
 Develop
 new products to meet the needs of new customers.

Operations
Plan 

Our
operations plan can be broken down into three distinct areas: material management, manufacturing space planning and efficiencies associated
with economies of scale. 

18 

Materials
Management 

The
largest portion of our costs is materials. We have completed the following activities in order to demonstrate continuous improvement: 

- 
 Successful
 completion of annual surveillance audit for ISO 9001:2008 certificate, with no major nonconformance issues 

- 
 Weekly
 cycle counts on inventory items 

- 
 Weekly
 material review board meeting on non-moving piece parts 

- 
 Kanban
 kitting on products with consistent ship weekly ship quantities 

- 
 Daily
 cross functional floor meetings focused on delivery, yields and labor savings 

- 
 Redesigned
 floor layout using tenant improvement funds 

- 
 Daily
 review of yields and product velocity 

- 
 Bill
 of material reviews prior to work order release 

Future
continuous improvement opportunities include installation and training of shop floor control module within the ERP system and organizational
efficiencies of common procurement techniques among buyers. 

Manufacturing
Space Planning 

We
currently lease 93,967 square feet of manufacturing space (see Properties ). Our current facilities are sufficient to meet
our immediate production needs without excess capacity. As our processes are primarily labor driven, we are able to easily adapt to changes
in customer demand by adjusting headcounts, overtime schedules and shifts in line with production needs. In the event additional floor
space is required to accommodate new contracts, Optex has the option to lease adjacent floor space at the current negotiated lease cost
per square foot. Consistent with the space planning, we will drive economies of scale to reduce support costs on a percentage of sales
basis. These cost reductions can then be either passed through directly to the bottom line or used for business investment. 

Our
manufacturing process is driven by the use of six sigma techniques and process standardization. Initial activities in this area have
been the successful six sigma projects in several production areas which have led to improved output and customer approval on the aesthetics
of the work environment. In addition, we use many tools including 5S programs and six sigma processes, and define, measure, analyze,
improve, control (DMAIC) problem solving techniques to identify bottlenecks within the process flow, reduce cost and improve product
yields. Successful results can then be replicated across the production floor and drive operational improvements. 

Economies
of Scale 

Plant
efficiencies fluctuate as a function of program longevity, complexity and overall production volume. Our internal processes are primarily
direct labor intensive and can be more easily adapted to meet fluctuations in customer demand; however, our material purchases, subcontracted
operations and manufacturing support costs are extremely sensitive to changes in volume. As our volume increases, our support labor,
material and scrap costs decline as a percentage of revenue as we are able to obtain better material pricing, and scrap, start up and
support labor (fixed) costs and they are spread across a higher volume base. Conversely, as production volumes decline, our labor and
material costs per unit of production generally increase. Additional factors that contribute to economies of scale relate to the longevity
of the program. Long running, less complex programs (e.g., periscopes) do not experience as significant of an impact on labor costs as
production volumes change, as the associated workforce is generally less skilled and can be ramped quickly as headcounts shift. Our more
complex thin laser filter coatings, Howitzer and thermal day/night programs are more significantly impacted by volume changes as they
require a more highly-skilled workforce and ramp time is longer as the training is more complex. We continually monitor customer demand
over a rolling twelve-month window and in order to anticipate any changes in necessary manpower and material which allows us to capitalize
on any benefits associated with increased volume and minimize any negative impact associated with potential declines in product quantities.

Intellectual
Property 

We
utilize several highly specialized and unique processes in the manufacture of our products. While we believe that these trade
secrets have value, it is probable that our future success will depend primarily on the innovation, technical expertise,
manufacturing and marketing abilities of our personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the confidentiality of
our trade secrets or that our non-disclosure agreements will provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets, know-how or other
proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or other disclosure. The confidentiality agreements
that are designed to protect our trade secrets could be breached, and we might not have adequate remedies for the breach.
Additionally, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how might otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others. We
possess three utility patents and three design patents. 

Our
competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources, may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for and
obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make and sell some of our products. Although we believe that
our products do not infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties, we cannot assure you that third parties will
not assert infringement claims against us or that such claims will not be successful. 

The
following patents generally expire 20 years after issuance. 

On
April 4, 2023, we were issued U.S. Patent No. 11,619,824 B2 titled Selectable Offset Image Wedge which is a mechanical
wedge used to offset the image anywhere in the selectable range of circular travel within the defined offset field of view. This application
is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent No. 10,324,298 and claims priority to U.S. Patent No. 10,324,298, issued on June 18, 2019. 

On
November 4, 2021 we were issued U.S. Patent No. 2021/0341746A1 titled Selectable Offset Image Wedge which is a mechanical
wedge used to offset the image anywhere in the selectable range of circular travel within the defined offset field of view. This application
is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent No. 10,324,298 and claims priority to U.S. Patent No. 10,324,298, issued on June 18, 2019. 

On
June 18, 2019 we were issued U.S. Patent No. 10,324,298 titled Offset Image Wedge with Dual Capability and Alignment Technique .
The invention relates to an offset image wedge for use on a bore-sighted rifle mounted directly onto the scope via a clamp mounting device.
The wedge allows for a dual image which can be aligned in the field and provides the user with a choice of either a bore-sighted image
or an offset image without removing the wedge. 

On
July 11, 2017, we were issued U.S. Patent No. D791,852 S, for our Red Tail Digital Spotting Scope. We have a retail sales relationship
with Cabela s Inc. and Amazon, to distribute these scopes. They are currently the only digital spotting scope offered by Cabela s.
Our Red Tail Digital Spotting Scopes also received a favorable review from Trigger Magazine in 2017. 

In
May 2015, we announced the issuance to us of U.S. Patent No. 13,792,297 titled ICWS Periscope . This invention improves
previously accepted levels of periscope performance that, in turn, improve soldier s safety. 

In
December 2013, Optex Systems, Inc. was issued U.S. Patent No. 23,357,802 titled Multiple Spectral Single Image Sighting System
Using Single Objective Lens Set. The technology platform, designed for our DDAN program, is applicable to all ground combat vehicles
used by the US and foreign militaries. This invention presents a single image to both day and night sensors using precision optics, which
in turn allows the user to individually observe day, night, or day and night simultaneously. In addition, it has proven to be especially
useful in light transition points experienced at dusk and dawn. We are in production and currently delivering sighting systems with this
advanced technology, a significant upgrade in the goal of supporting our customers as they modernize the worldwide inventory of aging
armored vehicles. This technology is applicable to many sighting systems, and it has already been designed for implementation on the
Light Armored Vehicles, the Armored Security Vehicle, the Amphibious Assault Vehicle, and the M60 Main Battle Tank. Digital Day and Night
technology has advanced the capabilities of these installed weapon systems and is the first in a series of patents we have applied for
to protect our Intellectual Property portfolio in support of the warfighters who use these systems. 

20 

In
May 2012, we purchased a perpetual, non-exclusive license, with a single up-front license fee of 200,000 to use Patent 7,880,792 Optical
and Infrared Periscope with Display Monitor (issued in 2011 and owned by Synergy International Optronics, LLC). We believe the
purchase of the license agreement may allow us to extend and expand our market potential for the M113APC vehicle type which has the highest
number of commonly used armored vehicles in the world. The current estimated active M113 APC worldwide inventory is over 80,000 units.
This licensing of this patent allows us to develop additional products for this vehicle type, including the M17 Day/Thermal and M17 Day/Night
periscopes. We are actively marketing the new periscopes internationally and completed our first international shipment utilizing this
technology in March 2014. We continue to prototype these products and demonstrate them to potential customers. 

Competition 

The
markets for our products are competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of our ability to design and engineer products to meet performance
specifications set by our customers. Our customers include military and government end users as well as prime contractors that purchase
component parts or subassemblies, which they incorporate into their end products. Product pricing, quality, customer support, experience,
reputation and financial stability are also important competitive factors. 

There
are a limited number of competitors in each of the markets for the various types of products that we design, manufacture and sell. At
this time, we consider our primary competitors for the Optex, Richardson site to be Kent Periscopes and Synergy International Optronics,
LLC. The Applied Optics Center thin film and laser coatings products compete primarily with Materion-Barr, Artemis and Alluxa. 

Our
competitors are often well entrenched, particularly in the defense markets. While we believe that the quality of our technologies and
product offerings provides us with a competitive advantage over certain manufacturers, some of our competitors have substantially greater
financial and other resources than we do to spend on the research and development of their technologies and for funding the construction
and operation of commercial scale plants. 

We
expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products. We cannot assure investors that our competitors
will not develop enhancements to, or future generations of, competitive products that will offer superior price or performance features,
or that new technology or processes will not emerge that render our products less competitive or obsolete. Increased competitive pressure
could lead to lower prices for our products, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Also, competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost, and we may not be able to successfully
develop or expend the financial resources necessary to acquire new technology. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully
in the future. 

Employees
and Human Capital 

We
had 106 full time equivalent employees as of October 1, 2023 and 102 employees as of December 6, 2023, which include a small temporary
work force to handle peak loads as needed. We are in compliance with local prevailing wage, contractor licensing and insurance regulations,
and have good relations with our employees, who are not currently unionized. We use outside consultants for various services. We have
not experienced any work stoppages and are not a party to a collective bargaining agreement. Management considers labor relations to
be good. 

We
are dedicated to preserving operational excellence and remaining an employer of choice. We provide and maintain a work environment that
is designed to attract, develop and retain top talent through offering our employees an engaging work experience that contributes to
their career development. We recognize that our success is based on the collective talents and dedication of those we employ, and we
are highly invested in their success. We value our employees and believe that employee loyalty and enthusiasm are key elements of our
operating performance.

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Investing
in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together
with all of the other information included or referred to in this Annual Report, before purchasing shares of our common stock. There
are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. The risks described below are not the
only risks we face. If any of these risks actually materializes, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially
adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors in our common stock could lose all
or part of their investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not exclusive and are intended to reflect the material risks
that are specific to us, our industry and companies that have securities trading on an over-the-counter market. 

Risks
Related to our Business 

Our
results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions globally and the effects of these conditions on
our customers businesses and levels of business activity. 

Economic
and political events in the past few years have altered the landscape in which we and other U.S. companies operate in a variety of ways.
In response to inflationary pressures, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates, resulting in an increase in the cost of borrowing
for us, our customers, our suppliers, and other companies relying on debt financing. World events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine
and the resulting economic sanctions, have impacted the global economy, including by exacerbating inflationary and other pressures linked
to COVID-related supply chain disruptions. In addition, the threat of a larger war in the Middle East after the Hamas terrorist attacks
on Israel could affect oil prices and have other, potentially recessionary, effects on the global economy. Prolonged inflationary conditions
and prolonged periods of high interest rates could further negatively affect U.S. and international commerce and exacerbate or prolong
the period of high energy prices and supply chain constraints. At this time, the extent and duration of these economic and political
events and their effects on the economy and the Company are impossible to predict. 

Low
unemployment and tight labor markets may adversely affect our labor costs and our ability to hire and retain a sufficient workforce required
to meet the backlog and customer demands. If we are not able to maintain a sufficient workforce and attract and retain additional personnel
as required, we may not be able to implement our business plan and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

We
compete with several other large defense contractors, as well as homebuilding, industrial manufacturing and warehousing industries within
the immediate area of our manufacturing facilities for both lower and higher skill level manufacturing employees. The limited supply
of available workers for hire, combined with increasing competition among other local industries, may result in increased production
costs associated with higher wages, employee bonuses, overtime premiums and enhanced employee benefits in addition to cost increases
associated with employee recruitment, employee turnover, training and learning curve inefficiencies. We may be unable to fill the labor
positions required to meet our customer demands in a timely or cost-effective manner, which would impede our ability to meet current
or increasing production levels in line with our customer expectations and adversely affect our ability to grow revenue or maintain our
current margin levels. 

Our
ability to fulfill our backlog may have an effect on our long-term ability to procure contracts and fulfill current contracts. 

Our
ability to fulfill our backlog may be limited by our ability to devote sufficient financial and human capital resources and limited by
available material supplies. Disruptions in our supply chain and transportation delays, combined with inflationary pressures and tight
labor market conditions could impede our ability to meet customer requirements. If we do not fulfill our backlog in a timely manner,
we may experience delays in product delivery which would postpone receipt of revenue from those delayed deliveries. Additionally, if
we are consistently unable to fulfill our backlog, this may be a disincentive to customers to award large contracts to us in the future
until they are comfortable that we can effectively manage our backlog. 

22 

Our
historical operations depend on government contracts and subcontracts. We face risks related to contracting with the federal government,
including federal budget issues and fixed price contracts. 

Future
general political and economic conditions, which cannot be accurately predicted, may directly and indirectly affect the quantity and
allocation of expenditures by federal agencies. Even the timing of incremental funding commitments to existing, but partially funded,
contracts can be affected by these factors. Therefore, cutbacks or re-allocations in the federal budget could have a material adverse
impact on our results of operations. Obtaining government contracts may also involve long purchase and payment cycles, competitive bidding,
qualification requirements, delays or changes in funding, budgetary constraints, political agendas, extensive specification development,
price negotiations and milestone requirements. In addition, our government contracts are primarily fixed price contracts, which may prevent
us from recovering costs incurred in excess of budgeted costs. Fixed price contracts require us to estimate the total project cost based
on preliminary projections of the project s requirements. The financial viability of any given project depends in large part on
our ability to estimate such costs accurately and complete the project on a timely basis. Some of those contracts are for products that
are new to our business and are thus subject to unanticipated impacts to manufacturing costs. Even if our estimates are reasonable at
the time made, prices of materials are subject to unanticipated adverse fluctuation. In the event our actual costs exceed the fixed costs
determined under our product contracts, we will not be able to recover the excess costs which could have a material adverse effect on
our business and results of operations. We examine these contracts on a regular basis and accrue for anticipated losses on these contracts,
if necessary. 

We have several multiyear IDIQ contracts at
fixed prices which have open ordering periods and are currently at low profit rates or in a loss condition. These contracts are
typically three-year IDIQ contracts with two optional award years, and as such, we are obligated to accept new task awards against
these contracts until the contract expiration. Should contract costs continue to increase above the negotiated selling price, or in
the event the customer should release substantial quantities against these existing loss contracts, the losses could be material.
For contracts currently in a loss status based on the estimated per unit contract costs, losses are booked immediately on new task
order awards. As of October 1, 2023, there was 243
thousand in accrued loss provisions for loss contracts or cost overruns. 

Approximately
92 of our contracts contain termination clauses for convenience. In the event these clauses should be invoked by our customer, future
revenues against these contracts could be affected, however these clauses allow for a full recovery of any incurred contract costs plus
a reasonable fee up through and as a result of the contract termination. We are currently unaware of any pending terminations on our
existing contracts. 

In
some cases, contract awards may be issued that are subject to renegotiation at a date (up to 180 days) subsequent to the initial award
date. Generally, these subsequent negotiations have had an immaterial impact (zero to 5 on the contract price of the affected contracts.
Currently, none of our awarded contracts are subject to renegotiation. 

We
have sought to minimize the adverse impact from the slower pace of U.S. military orders on our results of operations by seeking to obtain
foreign military orders, expanding our customer base as well as seeking new commercial business. We do not expect these markets to completely
mitigate the negative impact of lower U.S. defense spending. 

If
we fail to scale our operations appropriately in response changes in demand, we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit
potential market opportunities, and our business could be materially and adversely affected. 

Significant
fluctuations in customer demand place a significant strain on our management personnel, infrastructure and resources. To implement our
current business and product plans, we need to appropriately manage our cost base, as well as train, manage and motivate our workforce,
while continuing to maintain our critical operational and financial systems and our manufacturing and service capabilities. All of these
endeavors require substantial management effort and potential capital. If we are unable to effectively manage our operations to our customer
demand levels, we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities,
and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected. 

We
do not have employment agreements with our key personnel, other than our Chief Executive and Financial Officers, and our management has
minimal unencumbered equity ownership in us. If we are not able to retain our key personnel or attract additional key personnel as required,
we may not be able to implement our business plan and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

We
depend to a large extent on the abilities and continued participation of our executive officers and other key employees. The loss of
either executive officer or any other key employee could have a material adverse effect on our business. We currently have only two employment
agreements. We do not presently
maintain key man insurance on any other key employees. We believe that experienced personnel will continue to be required
to implement our business plan. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that they will be available when
required, or that we will have the ability to attract and retain them. In addition, due to our small size, we do not presently have depth
of staffing in our executive, operational and financial management areas in order to have an effective succession plan should the need
arise. Thus, in the event of the loss of one or more of our management employees, our results of operations could be vulnerable to challenges
associated with recruiting additional key personnel, if such recruiting efforts are not successful in a timely manner.

Certain
of our products are dependent on specialized sources of supply potentially subject to disruption which could have a material, adverse
impact on our business. 

We
expect recent supply chain disruptions driven by the pandemic and Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the related sanctions, combined
with raw material shortages, labor shortages, transportation delays and inflationary pressures, to continue for the foreseeable future.
These conditions have strained our suppliers and extended supplier delivery lead times, affecting their ability to sustain operations.
We are experiencing market wide material shortages for paint and resin products as well as critical epoxies and chemicals used in our
manufacturing process. In addition, we are seeing substantial increases in the costs of aluminum, steel and acrylic commodities. In addition,
we have experienced supplier schedule delays for other key components which are driven by supplier labor and material shortages. In several
cases, spotty supply and material shortages have resulted in stocking higher inventory safety stock levels to ensure adequate
lead time to replenish critical supplies. 

We
have selectively single-sourced some of our material components in order to mitigate excess procurement costs associated with significant
tooling and startup costs. Furthermore, because of the nature of government contracts, we are often required to purchase selected items
from U.S. government approved suppliers, which may further limit our ability to utilize multiple supply sources for these key components. 

To
the extent any of these single sourced or government approved suppliers may have disruptions in deliveries due to production, quality,
or other issues, we may also experience related production delays or unfavorable cost increases associated with retooling and qualifying
alternate suppliers. The impact of delays resulting from disruptions in supply for these items could negatively impact our revenue, our
reputation with our customers, and our results of operations. In addition, significant price increases from single-source suppliers could
have a negative impact on our profitability to the extent that we are unable to recover these cost increases on our fixed price contracts. 

Each
contract has a specific quantity of material which needs to be purchased, assembled, and shipped. Prior to bidding on a contract, we
contact potential sources of material and receive qualified quotations for this material. In some cases, the entire volume is given to
a single supplier and in other cases; the volume might be split between several suppliers. If a contract has a single source supplier
and that supplier fails to meet their obligations (e.g., quality, delivery), then we would seek to find an alternate supplier and bring
this information back to the final customer. Contractual deliverables would then generally be re-negotiated (e.g., specifications, delivery,
price). As of December 1, 2023, approximately 9 of our material requirements are single-sourced across 13 suppliers representing approximately
27 of our active supplier order value. Single-sourced component requirements span across all of our major product lines. 

We
consider it a material financial or schedule risk if we believe it will take us at least three months to identify and qualify a suitable
replacement for specialized single source suppliers. In the table below, we identify those specialized single source suppliers with respect
to which we face such a material risk and the product lines supported by those materials utilized by us as of December 6, 2023.

The
defense technology supply industry is subject to technological change and if we are not able to keep up with our competitors and/or they
develop advanced technology as response to our products, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. 

The
market for our products is generally characterized by technological developments, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements,
frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product life cycles and severe price competition. Our competitors could also
develop new, more advanced technologies in reaction to our products. Currently accepted industry standards may change. Our success depends
substantially on our ability, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce
new products that take advantage of technological advances and adhere to evolving industry standards. An unexpected change in one or
more of the technologies related to our products, in market demand for products based on a particular technology or of accepted industry
standards could materially and adversely affect our business. We may or may not be able to develop new products in a timely and satisfactory
manner to address new industry standards and technological changes, or to respond to new product announcements by others. In addition,
new products may or may not achieve market acceptance. 

Unexpected
warranty and product liability claims could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

The
possibility of future product failures could cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products. We warrant
the quality of our products to meet customer requirements and be free of defects for twelve months subsequent to delivery. We establish
reserves for warranty claims based on our historical rate of returned shipments against these contracts. There can be no assurance that
this reserve will be sufficient if we were to experience an unexpectedly high incidence of problems with our products. Significant increases
in the incidence of such claims may adversely affect our sales and our reputation with consumers. Costs associated with warranty and
product liability claims could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

25 

We
rely on the proper function, availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber-attack or
other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

We
rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Similar to
other companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion,
breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment
of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes
in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards. 

On
July 13, 2021, we experienced a ransomware attack. While we do not expect that attack to have material adverse consequences, similar
attacks, if not caught and effectively addressed in a timely manner, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

Any
failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions
or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or
other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Any
of these events may cause us to have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, be subject to legal claims and liability,
have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of
a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

We
derive almost all of our revenue from a small number of customers and the loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse
effect on our revenues. 

For
the year ended October 1, 2023, the Company s consolidated revenues were derived from U.S. government agencies (22 ), three U.S.
defense contractors (14 , 7 , and 6 ), one major commercial customer (23 and all other customers (28 ). Approximately 95 of total
Company revenue is generated from domestic customers and 5 is derived from foreign customers, primarily Canada. In particular, a decision
by one of our major defense contract customers, U.S. government agencies, or major commercial customers to cease issuing contracts to
us could have a significant material impact on our business and results of operations given that they represent over 72 of our gross
business revenue. There can be no assurance that we could replace these customers on a timely basis or at all. 

We
have approximately 151 discrete contracts with major defense contractors and the U.S. Government (primarily Defense Logistics Agencies
(DLA), and other prime U.S. defense contractors. If they choose to terminate these contracts, we are entitled to fully recover all contractual
costs and reasonable profits incurred up to or as a result of the terminated contract. 

We
only possess six patents and rely primarily on trade secrets to protect our intellectual property. 

We
utilize several highly specialized and unique processes in the manufacture of our products, for which we rely solely on trade secrets
to protect our innovations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or that our
non-disclosure agreements will provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event
of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or other disclosure. The non-disclosure agreements that are designed to protect our trade secrets
could be breached, and we might not have adequate remedies for the breach. 

It
is also possible that our trade secrets will otherwise become known or independently developed by our competitors, many of which have
substantially greater resources than us, and these competitors may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for or obtain,
patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make and sell some of our products. Although based upon our general
knowledge (and we have not conducted patent searches), we believe that our products do not infringe on the patents or other proprietary
rights of third parties; however, we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us or that such
claims will not be successful. 

26 

We
may need to raise additional capital in the future beyond any cash flow from our existing business; additional funds may not be available
on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. 

We
may need to raise additional capital in the future to finance our future working capital needs. We cannot assure you that any additional
capital will be available on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. Future equity or debt financings may be difficult to obtain.
If we are not able to obtain additional capital as may be required, our business, financial condition and results of operations could
be materially and adversely affected. 

We
anticipate that our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

our
 ability to fulfill backlog; 

our
 ability to procure additional production contracts; 

our
 ability to control costs; 

the
 timing of payments and reimbursements from government and other contracts, including but not limited to changes in federal government
 military spending and the federal government procurement process; 

increased
 sales and marketing expenses; 

technological
 advancements and competitors response to our products; 

capital
 improvements to new and existing facilities; 

our
 relationships with customers and suppliers; and 

general
 economic conditions including the effects of future economic slowdowns, acts of war or terrorism and the current international conflicts. 

Even
if available, financings may involve significant costs and expenses, such as legal and accounting fees, diversion of management s
time and efforts, and substantial transaction costs. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable
to finance our operations, develop or enhance our products, expand our sales and marketing programs, take advantage of future opportunities
or respond to competitive pressures. 

Risks
Related to our Credit Facility and Liquidity 

Our
level of debt and restrictions in our credit agreement could negatively affect our operations and limit our liquidity and our ability
to react to changes in the economy. 

Our
Loan Agreement with Texas Capital Bank contains restrictive covenants that require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at
least 1.25:1 and a total leverage ratio of 3.00:1, which we may fail to meet if there is a material decrease in our profitability or
liquidity. In addition, the Loan Agreement contains restrictive covenants governing indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes (including
changes in management), investments, and restricted payments (including cash dividends). The borrowings under the Loan Agreement are
secured by substantially all of our operating assets as collateral. 

A
breach of any of the restrictions and covenants could result in a default under our Loan Agreement, which, if not cured or waived, could
cause any outstanding indebtedness under the agreement (or under any future financing arrangements) to become immediately due and payable,
and result in the termination of commitments to extend further credit. We may not have sufficient funds on hand to repay the loan, and
if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, or are unable to refinance at all, our results of operations
and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by increased costs and rates. 

If
our debt level significantly increases in the future, it could have significant consequences on our ongoing operations including requiring
us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing debt rather than using it to execute our strategic
initiatives; limiting our ability to obtain additional debt financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, or other worthwhile
endeavors; and limiting our ability to react to changes in the market. 

27 

Risks
Related to Our Stock 

Our
stock typically trades in low volumes daily which could lead to illiquidity, volatility, or depressed stock price. 

Our
stock is listed on Nasdaq, but typically trades in low daily volumes. Because of a history of low trading volume, our stock is relatively
illiquid and its price may be volatile. This may make it more difficult for our stockholders to resell shares when desired or at attractive
prices. Some investors view low-volume stocks as unduly speculative and therefore not appropriate candidates for investment. Also, due
to the low volume of shares traded on any trading day, persons buying or selling in relatively small quantities may easily influence
prices of our stock. 

Any
analysts covering our stock could negatively impact the stock price. 

The
trading market for our common stock will likely be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish
about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any such analysts downgrade their evaluation of our stock, the price of our
stock could decline. Furthermore, if our operating results fail to meet analysts expectations, our stock price would likely decline. 

Our
stock price has been and will likely continue to be extremely volatile, and, as a result, stockholders may not be able to resell shares
at or above their purchase price, and we may be more vulnerable to securities class action litigation. 

Since
our common stock was listed on Nasdaq in March 2023, our stock price, as reported by Nasdaq, has ranged from a low of 2.87 to a high
of 4.47. As a result, the market price and trading volume of our common stock is likely to be similarly volatile in the future, and
investors in our common stock may experience a decrease, which could be substantial, in the value of their stock, including decreases
unrelated to our results of operations or prospects, and could lose part or all of their investment. 

In
the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has
often been brought against that company. Because of the potential volatility of our stock price, we may become the target of securities
litigation in the future. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could result in substantial costs, divert management s
attention and resources from our business and adversely affect our business. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined in SEC regulations, and the reduced disclosure requirements
applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined under SEC regulations and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various
reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies including, among other
things, reduced financial disclosure requirements including being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements
and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information
that they may deem important. We could remain a smaller reporting company indefinitely. As a smaller reporting company, investors may
deem our stock less attractive and, as a result, there may be less active trading of our common stock, and our stock price may be more
volatile. 

General
Risk Factors 

Changes
in current economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to continue operations. 

Changes
in current economic conditions may cause a decline in business, consumer and defense spending and capital market performance, which could
adversely affect our business and financial performance. Our ability to raise funds, which could be required for business continuity
or expansion of our operations, may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, such as a reduction in the availability
of credit, financial market volatility and economic recession. 

28 

In
the future, we may look to acquire other businesses in our industry and the acquisitions will require us to use substantial resources. 

In
the future, we may decide to pursue acquisitions of other businesses in our industry. In order to successfully acquire other businesses,
we would be forced to spend significant resources for both acquisition and transactional costs, which could divert substantial resources
in terms of both financial and personnel capital from our current operations. Additionally, we might assume liabilities of the acquired
business, and the repayment of those liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our cash flow. Furthermore, when a new business
is integrated into our ongoing business, it is possible that there would be a period of integration and adjustment required which could
divert resources from ongoing business operations. 

The
elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Delaware law and the existence of indemnification
rights to our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our
directors, officers and employees . 

We
provide indemnification to our directors and officers to the extent provided by Delaware law. The foregoing indemnification obligation
could result in our incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers,
which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against directors
and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders
against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. 

Our
stock price is speculative, and there is a risk of litigation. 

The
trading price of our common stock has in the past and may in the future be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as
the following: 

revenue
 or results of operations in any quarter failing to meet the expectations, published or otherwise, of the investment community; 

speculation
 in the press or investment community; 

wide
 fluctuations in stock prices, particularly with respect to the stock prices for other defense industry companies; 

announcements
 of technological innovations by us or our competitors; 

new
 products or the acquisition of significant customers by us or our competitors; 

changes
 in investors beliefs as to the appropriate price-earnings ratios for us and our competitors; 

changes
 in management; 

sales
 of common stock by directors and executive officers; 

rumors
 or dissemination of false or misleading information, particularly through Internet chat rooms, instant messaging, and other rapid-dissemination
 methods; 

conditions
 and trends in the defense industry generally; 

the
 announcement of acquisitions or other significant transactions by us or our competitors; 

adoption
 of new accounting standards affecting our industry; 

general
 market conditions; 

domestic
 or international terrorism and other factors; and 

other
 factors as described in this section. 

29 

Fluctuations
in the price of our common stock may expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits. Although no such lawsuits are currently
pending against us and we are not aware that any such lawsuit is threatened to be filed in the future, there is no assurance that we
will not be sued based on fluctuations in the price of our common stock. Defending against such suits could result in substantial cost
and divert management s attention and resources. In addition, any settlement or adverse determination of such lawsuits could subject
us to significant liability. 

Adverse
developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance
by financial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 

Events
involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional
counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other
similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon
Valley Bank SVB was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC as receiver; on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each
swept into receivership; and on May 1, 2023, First Republic Bank failed and regulators sold substantially all of its assets to JPMorgan
Chase Co. The failure of First Republic Bank occurred despite a previous attempt by some of the nation s largest banks to
shore up First Republic s capital. Although we assess our banking and customer relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate,
our access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future
business operations could be significantly impacted. 

In
addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing
terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit
and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in available
funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our operating expenses,
financial obligations or other obligations, result in breaches of our contractual obligations or result in violations of federal or state
wage and hour laws. Any of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the factors described above or other related or similar
factors not described above, could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity and our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that are set forth
in our financial statements elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

This
management s discussion and analysis reflects information known to management as of our fiscal year end, October 1, 2023, and the
date of filing. This MD A is intended to supplement and complement our audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year
ended October 1, 2023, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). You are encouraged to read our
financial statements in conjunction with this MD A. The financial information in this MD A has been prepared in accordance with
GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. In addition, we use non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental indicators of our operating performance
and financial position. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for comparing actual results from one period to another,
as well as for planning purposes. We will also report non-GAAP financial results as supplemental information, as we believe their use
provides more insight into our performance. When a non-GAAP measure is used in this MD A, it is clearly identified as a non-GAAP
measures and reconciled to the most closely corresponding GAAP measure. 

The
following discussion highlights the principal factors that have affected our financial condition and results of operations as well as
our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please see Special
cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements and Risk factors for a discussion of the uncertainties,
risks and assumptions associated with these forward-looking statements. The operating results for the periods presented were not significantly
affected by inflation.

Systems, Inc. manufactures optical sighting systems and assemblies for the U.S. Department of Defense, foreign military applications
and commercial markets. Its products are installed on a variety of U.S. military land vehicles, such as the Abrams and Bradley fighting
vehicles, light armored and advanced security vehicles and the Stryker family of vehicles. Optex Systems, Inc. (Delaware) also manufactures
and delivers numerous periscope configurations, rifle and surveillance sights and night vision optical assemblies. Optex Systems, Inc.
(Delaware) products consist primarily of build-to-customer print products that are delivered both directly to the armed services and
to other defense prime contractors. Less than 1 of our revenue is related to the resale of products substantially manufactured by others.
In this case, the product would likely be a simple replacement part of a larger system previously produced by Optex Systems, Inc. (Delaware). 

We
are both a prime and sub-prime contractor to the Department of Defense. Sub-prime contracts are typically issued through major defense
contractors such as General Dynamics Land Systems, Raytheon Corp., BAE, ADS Inc. and others. We are also a military supplier to foreign
governments such as Israel, Australia and NAMSA and South American countries and as a subcontractor for several large U.S. defense companies
serving foreign governments. 

By
way of background, the Federal Acquisition Regulation is the principal set of regulations that govern the acquisition process of government
agencies and contracts with the U.S. government. In general, parts of the Federal Acquisition Regulation are incorporated into government
solicitations and contracts by reference as terms and conditions effecting contract awards and pricing solicitations . 

Many
of our contracts are prime or subcontracted directly with the Federal government and, as such, are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation
Subpart 49.5, Contract Termination Clauses and more specifically Federal Acquisition Regulation clauses 52.249-2 Termination
for Convenience of the Government Fixed-Price) , and 49.504 Termination of fixed-price contracts for default . These
clauses are standard clauses on our prime military contracts and generally apply to us as subcontractors. It has been our experience
that the termination for convenience is rarely invoked, except where it is mutually beneficial for both parties. We are currently not
aware of any material pending terminations for convenience or for default on our existing contracts. 

In
the event a termination for convenience were to occur, Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.249-2 provides for full recovery of all
contractual costs and profits reasonably occurred up to and as a result of the terminated contract. In the event a termination for default
were to occur, we could be liable for any excess cost incurred by the government to acquire supplies from another supplier similar to
those terminated from us. We would not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond
the control and without the fault or negligence of the Company as defined by Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.249-8. 

In
addition, some of our contracts allow for government contract financing in the form of contract progress payments pursuant to Federal
Acquisition Regulation 52.232-16, Progress Payments . Subject to certain limitations, this clause provides for government
payment of up to 90 of incurred program costs prior to product delivery for small businesses like us. To the extent our contracts allow
for progress payments, we intend to utilize this benefit, thereby minimizing the working capital impact on Optex Systems Holdings for
materials and labor required to complete the contracts. 

Material
Trends and Recent Developments 

Recent
supply chain disruptions have strained our suppliers and extended supplier delivery lead times, affecting their ability to sustain operations.
We anticipate market wide material shortages for paint and resin products as well as critical epoxies and chemicals used in our manufacturing
process. In addition, we are seeing substantial increases in the costs of aluminum, steel and acrylic commodities, which has affected
our net income in the year ended October 1, 2023 and is expected to continue to have a negative effect on the margins expected to be
generated under our long-term fixed contracts over the next three years. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related
to Our Business - Certain of our products are dependent on specialized sources of supply potentially subject to disruption which
could have a material, adverse impact on our business. 

We
have experienced significant material shortages during the year ended October 1, 2023 and extending into the first three months of
fiscal year 2024 from several significant suppliers of our periscope covers and housings. These shortages affect several of our
periscope products at the Optex Richardson segment. The delays in key components, combined with labor shortages during the year
ended October 1, 2023, which continue into the first three months of fiscal year 2024, have negatively impacted our production
levels and have pushed the expected delivery dates into the first half of fiscal year 2024. We are aggressively seeking alternative
sources and actively expediting our current suppliers for these components as well as increasing employee recruitment initiatives
and overtime to attempt to mitigate any continuing risks to the periscope line. While we are encouraged by recent improvements in
supplier performance for the Optex Richardson segment periscope line which yielded increased revenue performance during the second
through fourth quarters, our suppliers have yet to ramp up deliveries sufficiently to keep pace with our current customer demands.
As such, we cannot give any assurances that expected customer delivery dates for our periscope products will not experience further
delays. 

32 

In
March 2023, we moved our line of credit from PNC Bank to Texas Capital Bank and increased our available line of credit to 3.0 million
from the previous 2.0 million line with PNC. The increase in credit limit helps us meet our working capital requirements in light of
the increased backlog and delay of revenues from the fiscal year 2023. 

We
refer also to Item 1. Business Market Opportunity: U.S. Military for a description of current trends in
U.S. government military spending and its potential impact on Optex, which may be material, including particularly the tables included
in that section and disclosure on the significant reduction in spending for U.S ground system military programs, which has a direct impact
on the Optex Systems Richardson segment revenue, all of which is incorporated herein by reference. 

We
refer to Item 1. Business Recent Events of this report for recent developments affecting the Company. 

Results
of Operations by Segment 

We
have presented the operating results by segment to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. Management
of Optex Systems Holdings uses the selected financial measures by segment internally to evaluate its ongoing segment operations and to
allocate resources within the organization accordingly. Segments are determined based on differences in products, location, internal
reporting and how operational decisions are made. Management has determined that the Optex Systems, Richardson plant (to which we refer
below as the Optex Systems segment or Optex Systems), and the Applied Optics Center, Dallas plant, which was acquired on November 3,
2014 (to which we refer below as the Applied Optics Center segment or Applied Optics Center), are separately managed, organized, and
internally reported as separate business segments. The table below provides a summary of selective statement of operations data by operating
segment for the years ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022 reconciled to the Audited Consolidated Results of Operations as presented
in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .

Our
total external sales revenues increased by 3.3 million in the fiscal year 2023, or 14.6 compared to the 2022 fiscal year. The Optex
Systems segment realized a 2.6 million, or 27.1 increase, and the Applied Optics Center segment realized an increase of 0.7 million,
or 5.4 , in external revenue compared to the prior year period. Intersegment revenues were 0.9 million for 2023 and 2022. Intersegment
revenues relate primarily to coated filters provided by the Applied Optics Center to Optex Systems in support of the Optex Systems periscope
line. 

Gross
profit increased 1.7 million and the gross margin percentage increased by 3.9 points from 21.9 in the 2022 fiscal year to 25.8 in
the 2023 fiscal year. Optex Systems gross profit increased by 1.3 million and the gross margin percentage increased to 19.7 as
compared to 11.5 in the prior year period on significantly higher revenue. Applied Optics Center gross profit increased by 0.4
million and the gross margin percentage increased to 29.3 as compared to 27.7 in the prior year period. The increase in consolidated
gross profit is primarily attributable to higher absorption of the fixed overhead cost base associated with higher revenue levels at
both operating segments combined with shifts in revenue mix in the Applied Optics Center. 

Consolidated
general and administrative costs increased from 3.2 million for the twelve months ended October 2, 2022 to 3.8 million for the twelve
months ended October 1, 2023. During the years ended 2023 and 2022, Applied Optics Center absorbed 1.3 million and 1.1 million, respectively, of fixed
general and administrative costs incurred by Optex Systems for support services. The increase in allocated general and administrative
expenses during the 2023 year is directly attributable to the increase of 0.6 million in general and administrative spending during
the twelve-month period combined with a shift in revenue volume between segments. These expenses cover accounting, executive, human resources,
information technology, board fees and other corporate expenses paid by Optex Systems and shared across both operating segments. 

Consolidated
operating income increased by 1.2 million in the year ended October 1, 2023 to an income of 2.8 million as compared to the prior year
operating income of 1.6 million. The increase in operating income is primarily attributable to operating income of 1.0 million at the
Optex Systems segment and increased operating income of 0.2 million at the Applied Optics Center segment on higher revenue and gross
profit. The increased segment operating income is slightly offset by a decrease in operating income of 0.1) million in other unallocated
costs for increases in general and administrative and interest costs as compared to the prior year. 

Income
before taxes increased 1.1 million, to 2.7 million in the 2023 fiscal year from a prior year income before taxes of 1.6 million. The
increase in income before taxes year over year is primarily due to the increase in revenue and gross profit in both segments. 

New
Orders and Backlog 

Product
backlog represents the value of unfulfilled customer manufacturing orders yet to be recognized as revenue. While backlog is not a non-GAAP
financial measure, it is also not defined by GAAP. Therefore, our methodology for calculating backlog may not be consistent with methodologies
used by other companies. The booked backlog by period may also not be fully indicative of the predicted revenues for those periods as
many of our orders provide for accelerated delivery without penalty and may additionally provide customers the option to adjust schedules
to meet their most recent projected demand quantities. However, we provide customer order and backlog information as we believe it provides
significant insight into forward demand, with some predictive power to short term future revenues. 

During
the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, the Company booked 34.6 million in new orders, representing a 23.6 increase from the prior
year period orders of 28.0 million. The orders for the most recently completed twelve months consist of 23.3 million for our Optex
Richardson segment and 11.3 million attributable to the Applied Optics Center segment.

The
Company has seen significant increases in orders for many of its defense products during the fiscal year 2023 inclusive of two new customers
for our sighting systems and filter programs. On November 1, 2022, the Company announced it has been awarded a 3.4 million sighting
system order to repair and refurbish night vision equipment for the Government of Israel. The order represents a significant increase
in our Optex Richardson sighting systems business base for a new customer and includes an additional potential award value with a 100 
optional award quantity clause. Deliveries under this contract are expected to begin in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our Optex
Richardson periscope orders have increased 6.7 million, or 72.8 over the prior year, including 9.0 million in task delivery awards
against our long term IDIQ contracts. On June 30, 2023, we booked a 3.0 million delivery order at our Applied Optics segment for the
delivery of laser interface filters against a five-year IDIQ contract. On September 18, 2023, the Company announced it was awarded a
five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract from the U.S. Government, for M22 (7 x 50) Binoculars with an estimated
value of 2.12 million. As of October 1, 2023, the Applied Optics Center had received task orders valuing 0.5 million against this award. 

The
Optex Systems Richardson segment currently has six open US Government IDIQ type military contracts for periscopes and two open IDIQ
contracts with another prime contractor for periscopes and unity mirrors with unspent funding which covers base year and option year
requirement periods into 2029. We anticipate additional orders throughout the next five years for these ongoing contracts. In
addition, the Company has three open bid requests for new multi-year IDIQ contracts pending with the U.S. Government for additional
periscopes that are expected to be awarded in the next twelve months. 

Backlog
as of October 1, 2023 was 41.8 million as compared to a backlog of 32.9 million as of October 2, 2022, representing an increase of
27.1 . The following table depicts the current expected delivery by quarter of all contracts awarded as of October 1, 2023, as well as

Optex
Systems - Richardson 

During
the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, backlog for our Optex Richardson segment increased by 76.7 , or 11.5 million to 26.5 million,
as compared to the prior year ending backlog of 15.0 million. 

Backlog
for our periscope product line has increased 96.1 or 7.3 million to 14.9 million, from our 2022 fiscal year end level of 7.6 million,
primarily on new order releases against our long term IDIQ contracts. Our projected periscope revenue over the next twelve months is
currently exceeding our supplier and headcount capacity. We are currently working with our suppliers to ramp up material deliveries in
addition to adding automated buffing equipment and manpower to increase production capacity in line with our increasing customer demands
over the next twelve months. 

Sighting
Systems product line backlog increased 176.5 , or 3.0 million, to 4.7 million, from our 2022 fiscal year end level of 1.7 million. The
increased backlog is primarily driven by the 3.4 million order from Israel for the repair and refurbishment of night vision equipment.
Deliveries against the new award are expected to begin in the second fiscal quarter of 2024, pending the approval of export licenses. 

The
Howitzer contract awarded in July 2020 continues to experience customer driven delays related to customer furnished materials. This program
is currently on hold pending statement of work changes and materials furnished by the customer. 

Our
backlog in other product groups increased by 1.2 million or 35.3 from 3.4 million in 2022 to 4.6 million in 2023 on new orders booked
during the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, primarily for muzzle reference systems and spare components for a major U.S. defense
contractor, combined with 0.3 million in optical wedge assemblies for a commercial customer. 

Applied
Optics Center Dallas 

The
Applied Optics Center backlog decreased by 2.6 million, or 14.5 , for the year ended October 1, 2023, from 17.9 million in 2022 to
 15.3 million in 2023. 

Backlog
for our optical assemblies decreased by 4.0 million, or 58.8 , as compared to the prior year on lower customer demand from one of our
commercial customers. We anticipate new order bookings during the next six months, although we are projecting an overall revenue reduction
in optical assemblies of approximately 40 over the next twelve months compared to fiscal year 2023. 

36 

Laser
filter backlog increased by 1.2 million, or 13.8 , during the year due to 3.5 million in new order releases against our U.S.
Government long term laser interface filter contract in addition to several new orders booked from other U.S. defense contractors
for laser interface filters and laser filter units. We are anticipating additional order bookings for delivery in the fourth fiscal
quarter of 2024 and a substantial increase in laser filter revenue of 55-60 over the next twelve months from the 2023
levels. 

Day
window backlog decreased by 0.3 million during the period as compared to the prior year as we continue to deliver against the existing
orders from our ending 2022 backlog. We anticipate a slight increase in deliveries for day windows over the next twelve months based
on the customer contract schedules. 

Other
Applied Optics backlog increased by 0.5 million, or 125.0 for the year ended October 1, 2023, on new orders booked during the period
for M22 binoculars. On September 18, 2023, the Company announced it was awarded a 5-year IDIQ contract from the U.S. Government, for
M22 (7 x 50) Binoculars with an estimated value of 2.12 million and during the month of September, the Company received 0.5 million
in task award orders against this contract. Deliveries against the contract are expected to begin in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024. 

Please
refer to Material Trends and Recent Events above or Liquidity and Capital Resources below for
more information on recent developments and trends with respect to our orders and backlog, which information is incorporated herein by
reference. 

The
Company continues to pursue domestic, international and commercial opportunities in addition to maintaining its current footprint with
U.S. vehicle manufactures, with existing as well as new product lines. We are also reviewing potential products outside our traditional
product lines.
Further, we continue to look for strategic businesses to acquire that will strengthen our existing product line, expand our operations,
and enter new markets.

filter revenue increased by 0.5 million, or 8.5 , during the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 as compared to the prior twelve-month
period on higher demand for laser interface filters and laser filter units from multiple defense contract customers. 

Revenues
on our day windows decreased by 0.4 million, or 40.0 , during the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 as compared to October 2, 2022
as we continue to ship against our existing customer contract schedule. 

Applied
Optics Center revenue for other product lines decreased by 0.1 million, or 9.1 , during the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 as compared
to the prior twelve-month period on decreased revenue for unity mirrors. 

Gross
Margin . The gross margin for the year ended October 1, 2023 was 25.8 of revenue as compared to a gross margin of 21.9 of revenue
for the year ended October 2, 2022. Cost of sales increased by 1.6 million to 19.0 million for 2023 compared to 17.5 million for 2022.
The gross profit increased by 1.7 million to 6.6 million in 2023 as compared to 4.9 million in 2022. The increase is primarily due
to higher revenue and shifts between segments and product lines combined with higher fixed cost absorption at both the Applied Optics
Center and Optex Richardson segments related to increased production volume. 

G A
Expenses . For the years ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, we recorded operating expenses of 3.83 million and 3.25 million,
respectively. General and administrative cost increases of 0.6 million, or 17.8 , for fiscal year 2023 as compared to the prior year,
are primarily attributable to increases of 0.2 million relating to labor expenses and 0.2 million relating to office, legal, IT and
audit expenses, combined with a 0.1 million increase in stock compensation and a 0.1 million increase in bank fees. During the twelve
months ended October 1, 2023, approximately 0.1 million of the increase in office and legal expense are directly related to our uplisting
to the NASDAQ market in March 2023. 

Operating
Income . For the year ended October 1, 2023, we recorded operating income of 2.8 million as compared to operating income of 1.6
million during the year ended October 2, 2022. The 1.2 million increase in operating income is primarily due to higher revenue and gross profit, partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses. 

Net
income applicable to common shareholders . During the year ended October 1, 2023, we recorded net income applicable to common shareholders
of 2.3 million as compared to net income applicable to common shareholders of 1.3 million during the year ended October 2, 2022. The
increase of net income of 1.0 million is primarily attributable to the increase in operating profit, offset by increased interest expense
of 0.1 million and increased income tax expense of 0.1 million over the prior year period.

Non
GAAP Adjusted EBITDA 

We
use adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as an additional measure for evaluating the performance
of our business as net income includes the significant impact of noncash valuation gains and losses on warrant liabilities,
noncash compensation expenses related to equity stock issues, as well as depreciation, amortization, interest expenses and federal income
taxes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of our operating performance because it permits period-over-period comparisons
of our ongoing core operations before the excluded items, which we do not consider relevant to our operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial
measure not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). 

Adjusted
EBITDA has limitations and should not be considered in isolation or a substitute for performance measures calculated under GAAP. This
non-GAAP measure excludes certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate
Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, which limits the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a comparative
measure. 

The
table below summarizes our twelve-month operating results for the periods ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, in terms of both
the GAAP net income measure and the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA measure.

during the twelve months ended October 2, 2022. The increase in EBITDA is primarily driven by increased revenue and operating profit
during the current year as compared to the prior year twelve-month period. Operating segment performance is discussed in greater detail
throughout the previous sections. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of October 1, 2023, Optex Systems Holdings had working capital of 13.5 million, as compared to 10.0 million as of October 2, 2022.
During the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, we used operating cash of 0.3) million, primarily driven by increased inventory,
and spent 0.4) million on acquisitions of property and equipment. During the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, our net
borrowing against the credit facility was 1.0 million. 

Backlog
as of October 1, 2023 was 41.8 million as compared to a backlog of 32.9 million as of October 2, 3022, representing an increase of
27.1 . For further details, see Results of Operations New Orders and Backlog 
above. 

The
Company has historically funded its operations through cash from operations, convertible notes, common and preferred stock offerings
and bank debt. The Company s ability to generate positive cash flows depends on a variety of factors, including the continued
development and successful marketing of the Company s products. At October 1, 2023, the Company had approximately 1.2 million
in cash and an outstanding payable balance of 1.0 against its 3.0 million line of credit. As of October 1, 2023, our outstanding
accounts receivable balance was 3.6 million, which has been collected during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. During the first
quarter of 2024, we paid down our credit facility to zero. 

We
refer to the disclosure above under Material Trends and Recent Developments with respect to recent supply chain
disruptions and material shortages, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. 

39 

In
the short term, the Company plans to utilize its current cash, available line of credit and operating cash flow to fund inventory purchases
in support of the backlog growth and higher anticipated revenue during the next twelve months. Short term cash in excess of our working
capital needs may be also be used to fund the purchase of product lines and other assets, including property and equipment required to
maintain or meet our growing backlog, in addition to repurchasing common stock against our current stock repurchase plan. Longer term,
excess cash beyond our operating needs may be used to fund new product development, company or product line acquisitions, or additional
stock purchases as attractive opportunities present themselves. 

In
some instances, new contract awards may allow for government contract financing in the form of contract progress payments pursuant to
Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.232-16, Progress Payments. Subject to certain limitations, this clause provides for government
payment of up to 90 of incurred program costs prior to product delivery for small businesses like us. To the extent any contracts allow
for progress payments and the respective contracts would result in significant preproduction cash requirements for design, process development,
tooling, material or other resources which could exceed our current working capital or line of credit availability, we intend to utilize
this benefit to minimize any potential negative impact on working capital prior to receipt of payment for the associated contract deliveries.
Currently none of our existing contracts allow for progress payments. 

We
refer to Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies Rental Payments under Non-cancellable Operating
Leases for a tabular depiction of our remaining minimum lease and estimated CAM payments under such leases as of October
1, 2023, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. 

The
Company expects to generate net income and positive cash flow from operating activities over the next twelve months. To remain
profitable, we need to maintain a level of revenue adequate to support our cost structure. Management intends to manage operations
commensurate with its level of working capital and line of credit facility during the next twelve months and beyond; however, uneven
revenue levels driven by changes in customer delivery demands, first article inspection requirements or other program delays
associated with the pandemic could create a working capital shortfall. In the event the Company does not successfully implement its
ultimate business plan, certain assets may not be recoverable. 

On
March 22, 2023, the Company and its subsidiary, Optex Systems, Inc. Optex , and with the Company, the Borrowers ),
entered into a Business Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement with Texas Capital Bank (the Lender ), pursuant
to which the Lender will make available to the Borrowers a revolving line of credit in the principal amount of 3 million (the Credit
Facility ). The commitment period for advances under the Credit Facility is twenty-six months expiring on May 22, 2025. We refer
to the expiration of that time period as the Maturity Date. Outstanding advances under the Credit Facility will accrue
interest at a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus a specified margin, subject to a specified floor interest
rate. The interest rate is currently at 8.08 per annum. As of October 1, 2023, the interest rate was 8.07 per annum. 

The
Loan Agreement contains customary events of default (including a 25 change in ownership) and negative covenants, including but not limited
to those governing indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes (including changes in management), investments, and restricted payments (including
cash dividends). The Loan Agreement also requires the Borrowers to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1 and a total
leverage ratio of 3.00:1. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the operating assets of the Borrowers as collateral.
The Borrowers obligations under the Credit Facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default as
defined in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement further provides for a 125,000 Letter of Credit sublimit. As of October 1, 2023, there
was 1.0 million borrowed under the Credit Facility which was fully repaid during the first three months of fiscal year 2024. As of October 1,
2023, the Company is in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility. 

The
Credit Facility replaced the prior 2 million line of credit with PNC Bank, National Association. 

On
September 22, 2021 the Company announced authorization for an additional 1 million stock repurchase program. As of July 2, 2023, there
was an authorized balance of 560 thousand remaining to be spent against the repurchase program. During the year ended October 1, 2023,
there were no stock repurchases against the plan. 

During
the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 the Company declared and paid no dividends. As of October 1, 2023, there are no outstanding declared
and unpaid dividends.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

A
critical accounting estimate is an estimate that: 

is
 made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, 

involves
 a significant level of estimation uncertainty, and 

has
 had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operation. 

Our
significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Some accounting policies
require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. These policies
are described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data of this report. 

Our
critical accounting estimates include warranty costs, contract losses and the deferred tax asset valuation. Future warranty costs are
based on the estimated cost of replacement for expected returns based upon our most recent experience rate of defects as a percentage
of warranty covered sales. Our warranty covered sales primarily include the Applied Optics Center optical assemblies. While our warranty
period is 12 months, our reserve balances assume a general 90-day return period for optical assemblies previously delivered plus any
returned backlog in-house that has not yet been repaired or replaced to our customer. If our actual warranty returns should significantly
exceed our historical rates on new customer products, significant production changes, or substantial customer changes to the 90-day turn-around
times on returned goods, the impact could be material to our operating profit. We have not experienced any significant changes to our
warranty trends in the preceding three years and do not anticipate any significant impacts in the near term. We monitor the actual warranty
costs incurred to the expected values on a quarterly basis and adjust our estimates accordingly. As of October 1, 2023, the Company had
accrued warranty costs of 75 thousand, as compared to 169 thousand as of October 2, 2022. The primary reason for the 94 thousand decrease
in reserve balances relates to lower customer returns on warrantied product being sold during the twelve months ended October 1, 2023,
combined with a decrease in customer returned backlog pending repair or replacement to our customer as compared to the warranty backlog
as of October 2, 2022. 

As
of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, we had 243 thousand, and 289 thousand, respectively, of contract loss reserves included in
our balance sheet accrued expenses. These loss contracts are related to some of our older legacy periscope IDIQ contracts which were
priced in 2018 through early 2020, prior to Covid-19 and the subsequent decline in revenue at the Optex Systems Richardson segment combined
with significant inflationary pressures on materials and labor in the last two years. Due to inflationary price increases on component
parts and higher internal manufacturing costs (as a result of escalating labor costs and higher burden rates), some of these contracts
are in a loss condition, or at marginal profit rates. These contracts are typically three-year IDIQ contracts with two optional award
years, and as such, we are obligated to accept new task awards against these contracts until the contract expiration. Should contract
costs continue to increase above the negotiated selling price, or in the event the customer should release substantial quantities against
these existing loss contracts, the losses could be material. For contracts currently in a loss status based on the estimated per unit
contract costs, losses are booked immediately on new task order awards. During the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, the accrued contract
losses decreased by 46 thousand on shipments against the active IDIQ contract backlog combined with improvements in manufacturing overhead
rates on higher revenue volume. There is no way to reasonably estimate future inflationary impacts, or customer awards on the existing
loss contracts. We continue to monitor these contracts throughout the year for any significant changes in addition to seeking potential
cost saving strategies to mitigate risk. 

As
of October 1, 2023, Optex Systems Inc. had a net carrying value of 0.9 million in deferred tax assets consisting of deferred tax assets
of 1.7 million and valuation reserves of 0.8) million. As of October 2, 2022, Optex Systems Inc. had a net carrying value of 0.9
million in deferred tax assets consisting of deferred tax assets of 1.8 million and valuation reserves of 0.9) million. The valuation
allowance covers certain deferred tax assets where we believe we will be unlikely to recover those tax assets through future operations.
The valuation reserve includes assumptions related to future taxable income which would be available to cover net operating loss carryforward
amounts. Because of the uncertainties of future income forecasts combined with the complexity of some of the deferred assets, these forecasts
are subject to change over time. While we believe our current estimate to be reasonable, changing market conditions and profitability,
changes in equity structure and changes in tax regulations may impact our estimated reserves in future periods.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We

stockholders equity, and cash flows for the twelve months then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
 financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for the twelve months then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and

compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
has conducted, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, an assessment, including
testing of the effectiveness, of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2023. Management s assessment of
internal control over financial reporting was conducted using the criteria in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. In connection with our management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as required
under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we have not identified any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting as of October 1, 2023. We have thus concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October
1, 2023.

to, prescribe rules pursuant to which the Grantee may elect to defer settlement of the Restricted Stock Units. Any deferral election
must be made in compliance with such rules and procedures as the Committee deems advisable. If the Grantee is deemed a specified
employee within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, as determined by the Committee, at a time when the Grantee becomes eligible
for settlement of the RSUs upon his separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, then to the
extent necessary to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, such settlement will be delayed until the
earlier of: (i) the date that is six months following the Grantee s separation from service and (ii) the Grantee s death. 

(c)
 No Rights in Forfeited Units . To the extent that the Grantee does not vest in any Restricted Stock Units, all interest in such
Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited. The Grantee has no right or interest in any Restricted Stock Units that are forfeited. 

5.
TAX WITHHOLDING 

When
the Restricted Period ends with respect to any Restricted Stock Units, Grantee shall make appropriate arrangements with the Company,
in accordance with the Plan and in a manner deemed satisfactory to the Committee, to provide for the withholding or payment of the amount
that the Company considers necessary to satisfy its withholding obligations, as applicable. 

6.
DEFINITION 

(a)
 Disabilit y means permanently and totally disabled within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended. 

6.
REGISTRATION 

(a)
 Timing of Registration. If the Company is advised by its counsel that shares deliverable upon settlement of the Restricted Stock
Units are required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 Act or any applicable state securities laws, or
that delivery of the shares must be accompanied or preceded by a prospectus meeting the requirements of that Act or such state securities
laws, and such registration has not then occurred or such prospectus has not then been delivered, then the Company will use its best
efforts to effect the registration or provide the prospectus within a reasonable time following the initial vesting date, but delivery
of shares by the Company may be deferred until the registration is effected or the prospectus is available. The Grantee shall have no
interest in shares of Common Stock covered by the Restricted Stock Units until certificates for the shares are issued or such shares
are issued in book-entry form. 

(b)
 Legend. If the shares deliverable upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units are not registered upon issuance, they shall bear
the following legend, in addition to any other legend deemed necessary or desirable by the Committee: 

The
transferability of this certificate and the shares of stock represented hereby are subject to federal and state securities laws and,
to the extent the issuance of such shares is not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on an effective registration
statement, such shares are considered restricted securities for purposes of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, and may not be transferred in the absence of an opinion from counsel to the Company that such transfer does not violate federal
securities laws.

with the terms of the Plan. 

8.
LIMITED INTEREST

nor interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate the Grantee as an employee at any time. 

(b)
 Capital Structure. The grant of this Award shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company or any of its subsidiaries

OPTEX
SYSTEMS HOLDINGS, INC. 

 CLAWBACK
POLICY 

(Adopted
November 16, 2023) 

I.
 Overview . The Board of Directors (the Board of Optex Systems Holdings, Inc. (the Company has adopted this Clawback Policy (the Policy to provide for the recovery of erroneously awarded executive compensation
in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the federal
securities laws. This Policy is designed to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ), Rule 10D-1 thereunder Rule 10D-1 and the applicable Nasdaq listing rules (the Nasdaq
Rules ). 

II.
 Administration . This Policy shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (if composed entirely of independent
directors, or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of independent directors serving on the Board) (the Committee ).
Any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding on all affected individuals. 

III.
 Covered Executives . This Policy applies to the Company s current and former executive officers as defined in Rule 10D-1
from time to time, which at the Effective Date (as defined below) include the Company s president, principal financial officer,
principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge
of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making
function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company, and also applies to such other senior executives
who may from time to time be deemed subject to the Policy by the Committee (the Covered Executives ). 

IV.
 Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation; Accounting Restatement . In the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting
restatement due to the Company s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including
any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously
issued financial statements (a Big R restatement), or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected
in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (a little r restatement), the Committee shall determine
the amount of any excess Incentive-based Compensation (as defined below) received (a) during the three completed fiscal years immediately
preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement (and if the Company changes its fiscal year,
any transition period of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years) (b) by a person (i)
on or after the effective date of the applicable Nasdaq listing rule, (ii) after beginning service as a Covered Executive, (iii) who
served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for the Incentive-based Compensation award, (c) while the Company
has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association. 

The
date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement is the earlier to occur of: (i) the date on which the Board,
a committee of the Board, or any of the Company s officers authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, conclude
or reasonably should have concluded that the Company is required to prepare such an accounting restatement or (ii) the date a court,
regulator, or legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare such an accounting restatement. 

The
date on which Incentive-based Compensation is deemed received is the Company s first fiscal period during which the performance
measure specified in the Incentive-based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the income-based compensation
occurs after the end of that period. 

V.
 Incentive-based Compensation . For purposes of this Policy, Incentive-based Compensation means any compensation
that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of any financial reporting measure, and includes, without
limitation, any such compensation granted under the Company s short-term incentive compensation programs, executive employment
agreements, 2023 Equity Incentive Plan and any other compensation arrangements, programs or plans that the Company may adopt from time
to time in the future. For these purposes, a financial reporting measure is a measure determined and presented in accordance
with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and all other measures that are derived wholly
or in part from such measures, including non-GAAP financial measures, stock price or total shareholder return. For the avoidance of doubt,
a financial reporting measure need not be presented in the Company s financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission SEC ). 

VI.
 Excess Incentive-based Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery . The amount to be recovered shall be the excess of the Incentive-based
Compensation paid to the Covered Executive based on the erroneous data over the Incentive-based Compensation that would have been paid
to the Covered Executive had it been based on the restated results, computed without regard to any taxes paid, all as determined by the
Committee. 

If
the Committee cannot determine the amount of excess Incentive-based Compensation received by the Covered Executive directly from the
information in the accounting restatement, then it will make its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting
restatement. 

VII.
 Method of Recovery . The Company will recover the amounts of erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation reasonably promptly,
as determined in compliance with the applicable Nasdaq Rules. The Committee will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recovering
Incentive-based Compensation hereunder which may include, without limitation: 

(a)
requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive-based Compensation previously paid; 

(b)
seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based
awards; 

(c)
offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive; 

(d)
cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or 

2 

(e)
taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Committee. 

To
the extent that any Covered Executive fails to repay any erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation to the Company when due, the
Company shall take all actions reasonable and appropriate to recover such any erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation from the
Covered Executive. The applicable Covered Executive shall be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred
(including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence. 

VIII.
 Prohibition of Indemnification and Waiver . The Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executive against (a) the loss of any
erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation or (b) any claims relating to the Company s enforcement of its rights under this
Policy. Further, the Company shall not enter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive-based Compensation that is granted, paid or
awarded to a Covered Executive from the application of this Policy or that waives the Company s right to recovery hereunder, and
this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered into before, on or after the Effective Date of this Policy). 

IX.
 Disclosure Requirements . The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy required by applicable SEC filings
and rules. 

X.
 Interpretation . The Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary,
appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy and for the Company s compliance with Nasdaq Rules, Section 10D
of the Exchange Act, Rule 10D-1 thereunder and any other applicable law, regulation, rule or interpretation of the SEC or Nasdaq promulgated
or issued in connection therewith. 

XI.
 Effective Date . This Policy shall be effective as of the date it is adopted by the Board (the Effective Date ). 

XII.
 Amendment; Termination . The Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy
as it deems necessary. The Committee may terminate this Policy at any time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
XII, no amendment or termination of the Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any
action taken by the Company contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any federal securities
laws, SEC rule or Nasdaq rule. 

XIII.
 Other Recovery Rights . The Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent required by applicable law
and the Nasdaq Rules. Any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan or similar agreement or arrangement entered
into with a Covered Executive shall be deemed to include, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, an agreement by such
Covered Executive to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of,
any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment
agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company. However, to the extent
that the Covered Executive has already reimbursed the Company for any erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation received under
any duplicative recovery obligations established by the Company or applicable law, it shall be appropriate for any such reimbursed amount
to be credited to the amount of erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy. 

XIV.
 Impracticability . The Committee shall recover any excess Incentive-based Compensation in accordance with this Policy unless
such recovery would be impracticable, as determined by the Committee, in accordance with Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and the applicable
Nasdaq listing rule. 

XV. Successors .
This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors,
administrators or other legal representatives.
