TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Item 1. Business 
 GENERAL 
 
 We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. 
 
 We were formed in August 2017 to make investments and generate current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in one stop loans (a loan that combines characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans that are often referred to by other middle market lenders as unitranche loans) and other senior secured loans of U.S. middle-market companies that are, in most cases, sponsored by private equity firms. GC Advisors structures these one stop loans as senior secured loans, and we obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio company that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral often takes the form of first-priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company. In many cases, we are the sole lender, or we, together with our affiliates, are the sole lenders of one stop loans, which can afford us additional influence over the borrower in terms of monitoring and, if necessary, remediating any underperformance. 
 
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the term middle-market generally refers to companies having earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of less than 100.0 million annually. 
 
 Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in senior secured and one stop loans of U.S. middle-market companies. We also selectively invest in second lien and subordinated (a loan that ranks senior only to a borrower's equity securities and ranks junior to all of such borrower's other indebtedness in priority of payment) loans of, and warrants and minority equity securities in, middle-market companies. We intend to achieve our investment objective by (1) accessing the established loan origination channels developed by Golub Capital, a leading lender to middle-market companies that had over 60.0 billion of capital under management as of July 1, 2023, (2) selecting investments within our core middle-market company focus, (3) partnering with experienced private equity firms, or sponsors, in many cases with whom Golub Capital has invested alongside in the past, (4) implementing the disciplined underwriting standards of Golub Capital and (5) drawing upon the aggregate experience and resources of Golub Capital. 
 
 We commenced operations on October 2, 2017. We have sold and continue to offer and sell shares of our common stock in private placement transactions pursuant to certain exemptions of Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act and the laws of the states and jurisdictions where any offering is made. 
 
 We seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily senior secured and one stop loans by primarily investing approximately 5.0 million to 45.0 million of capital, on average, in the securities of U.S. middle-market companies. We expect to selectively invest more than 45.0 million in some of our portfolio companies and generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. 
 
 We generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which are often referred to as junk, have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which could increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment.

Our Adviser 
 
 Our investment activities are managed by our investment adviser, GC Advisors. GC Advisors is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research and due diligence on prospective investments and equity sponsors, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. GC Advisors was organized in September 2008 and is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act. Under our Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay GC Advisors a base management fee and an incentive fee for its services. See Business - Management Agreements - Management Fee for a discussion of the base management fee and incentive fee, including the cumulative incentive fee and the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to GC Advisors. Unlike most closed-end funds whose fees are based on assets net of leverage, our base management fee is based on our average-adjusted gross assets (including leverage but adjusted to exclude cash and cash equivalents so that investors do not pay the base management fee on such assets), and, therefore, GC Advisors benefits when we incur debt or use leverage. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, cash equivalents means U.S. government securities and commercial paper instruments maturing within 270 days of purchase. Additionally, under the incentive fee structure, GC Advisors benefits when capital gains are recognized and, because it determines when a holding is sold, GC Advisors controls the timing of the recognition of capital gains. Our board of directors is charged with protecting our interests by monitoring how GC Advisors addresses these and other conflicts of interest associated with its management services and compensation. While not expected to review or approve each borrowing, our independent directors periodically review GC Advisors services and fees as well as its portfolio management decisions and portfolio performance. In connection with these reviews, our independent directors consider whether our fees and expenses (including those related to leverage) remain appropriate. See Business - Management Agreements - Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
 
 GC Advisors is an affiliate of Golub Capital and pursuant to a staffing agreement, or the Staffing Agreement, Golub Capital LLC makes experienced investment professionals available to GC Advisors and provides access to the senior investment personnel of Golub Capital LLC and its affiliates. The Staffing Agreement provides GC Advisors with access to deal flow generated by Golub Capital LLC and its affiliates in the ordinary course of their businesses and commits the members of GC Advisors investment committee to serve in that capacity. As our investment adviser, GC Advisors is obligated to allocate investment opportunities among us and its other clients fairly and equitably over time in accordance with its allocation policy. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Related Party Transactions. However, there can be no assurance that such opportunities will be allocated to us fairly or equitably in the short-term or over time. GC Advisors seeks to capitalize on the significant deal origination, credit underwriting, due diligence, investment structuring, execution, portfolio management and monitoring experience of Golub Capital LLC s investment professionals. 
 
 Our Administrator 
 
 Golub Capital LLC, our Administrator and an affiliate of GC Advisors, provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. See Business - Management Agreements - Administration Agreement for a discussion of the fees and expenses (subject to the review and approval of our independent directors) we are required to reimburse to the Administrator.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Market Trends 
 
 We have identified the following trends that may affect our business: 
 
 Target Market. We believe that small and middle market companies in the United States with annual revenues between 10 million and 2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Golub Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us. We continue to focus our portfolio on borrowers in what we believe are recession resistant industries that are insulated from the effects of economic disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Specialized Lending Requirements . We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to U.S. middle market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle market and (3) also requires more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender. 
 
 Demand for Debt Capital . We believe there is a large pool of committed but uninvested private equity capital for middle market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and subordinated debt from other sources, such as us. 
 
 Competition from Bank Lenders. We believe that many traditional bank lenders to middle market businesses have either exited or de-emphasized their service and product offerings in the middle market. These traditional lenders have instead focused on lending and providing other services to large corporate clients. We believe this has resulted in fewer key players and the reduced availability of debt capital to the companies we target. 
 
 Market Environment: We believe middle market investments are likely to excel in uncertain market environments and that these investments have historically generated premium yields with more desirable structures for lenders as compared to large corporate loans. (1) In addition, we believe the recent credit market dislocation will accelerate the market share shift toward well-positioned larger platforms. On the other hand, we believe that there has been increased competition for direct lending to middle market businesses, which would be expected to result in less favorable pricing terms for our potential investments. If we match our competitors pricing, terms and structure, we would expect to experience decreased net interest income, lower yields and increased risk of credit loss. However, we believe that Golub Capital s scale, product suite, entrenched relationships and strong market position will continue to allow us to find investment opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 
 (1) Standard Poor s High-End Middle-Market Lending Review Q4 2021 New-issue first-lien yield-to-maturity. Middle-Market loans have, on average, generated higher yields in comparison to large corporate loans based on data starting in June 2005 . 
 
 Competitive Strengths 
 
 Deep, Experienced Management Team . We are managed by GC Advisors, which has access through the Staffing Agreement to the resources and expertise of Golub Capital s more than 850 employees, led by our chairman, Lawrence E. Golub, and our chief executive officer, David B. Golub. As of September 30, 2023, Golub Capital s more than 170 investment professionals had an average of approximately 13 years of investment experience and were supported by more than 650 administrative and back office personnel that focus on operations, finance, legal and compliance, accounting and reporting, marketing, information technology and office management. GC Advisors also manages (i) Golub Capital BDC Inc., a Delaware corporation, or GBDC; (ii) Golub Capital Direct Lending Corporation, a Maryland corporation, or GDLC; (iii) Golub Capital BDC 4, Inc., a Maryland corporation, or GBDC 4; (iv) Golub Capital Direct Lending Unlevered Corporation, a Maryland corporation, or GDLCU; and (v) Golub Capital Private Credit Fund, a Delaware statutory trust, or GCRED, each of which has elected to be regulated as a business development company, have investment mandates similar to ours, and primarily focus on investing in one stop and other senior secured loans and, in the case of GBDC, whose shares of common stock are publicly traded on

the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Golub Capital seeks to hire and retain high-quality investment professionals and reward those personnel based on investor returns. 
 
 Leading U.S. Debt Platform Provides Access to Proprietary Relationship-Based Deal Flow . GC Advisors gives us access to the deal flow of Golub Capital, one of the leading middle-market lenders in the United States. Golub Capital has been a top 3 Traditional Middle Market Bookrunner each year from 2008 through Q1 2023 for senior secured loans of up to 500.0 million for leveraged buyouts based on number of deals completed according to Thomson Reuters LPC and internal data. We believe this market position makes Golub Capital the first choice lender to many sponsors. Since its inception, Golub Capital has closed deals with over 370 middle-market sponsors and repeat transactions with over 260 sponsors. We believe that Golub Capital receives relationship-based early looks and last looks at many investment opportunities in the U.S. middle-market market, allowing it to be highly selective in the transactions it pursues. 
 
 Disciplined Investment and Underwriting Process. GC Advisors utilizes the established investment process of Golub Capital for reviewing lending opportunities, structuring transactions and monitoring investments. Using its disciplined approach to lending, GC Advisors seeks to minimize credit losses through effective underwriting, comprehensive due diligence investigations, structuring and the implementation of restrictive debt covenants. We expect that GC Advisors will continue to select borrowers whose businesses will retain significant value, even in a depressed market or a distressed sale. GC Advisors intends to reduce risk further by focusing on repeat transactions with proven, successful sponsors. While emphasizing thorough credit analysis, GC Advisors intends to maintain strong relationships with sponsors by offering rapid initial feedback from senior investment professionals on each investment opportunity. 
 
 Regimented Credit Monitoring. Following each investment, GC Advisors implements a regimented credit monitoring system. This careful approach, which involves ongoing review and analysis by teams of professionals, has enabled GC Advisors to identify problems early and to assist borrowers before they face difficult liquidity constraints. If necessary, GC Advisors can assume the role of deal sponsor in a work-out situation and has extensive restructuring experience, both in and out of bankruptcy. GC Advisors believes in the need to prepare for possible negative contingencies in order to address them promptly should they arise. 
 
 Concentrated Middle-Market Focus . Because of our focus on the middle-market, we understand the following general characteristics of middle-market lending: 
 
 middle-market companies are generally less leveraged than large companies and, we believe, offer more attractive investment returns in the form of upfront fees, prepayment penalties and higher interest rates; 
 
 middle-market issuers are more likely to have simple capital structures; 
 
 carefully structured covenant packages enable middle-market lenders to take early action to remediate poor financial performance; and 
 
 middle-market lenders can undertake thorough due diligence investigations prior to investment.

The following chart illustrates the stages of Golub Capital s evaluation and underwriting process: 
 
 ILLUSTRATIVE DEAL EVALUATION PROCESS 

Execution. In executing transactions for us, GC Advisors utilizes the due diligence process developed by Golub Capital. Through a consistent approach to underwriting and careful attention to the details of execution, Golub Capital seeks to maintain discipline with respect to credit, pricing and structure to ensure the ultimate success of the financing. Upon completion of due diligence, the investment team working on an investment delivers a final memorandum to GC Advisors investment committee. Once an investment has been approved by the investment committee, it moves through a series of steps generally, including initial documentation using standard document templates, final documentation, including resolution of business points and the execution of original documents held in escrow. Upon completion of final documentation, a loan is funded upon the execution of an investment committee memorandum by members of GC Advisors investment committee. 
 
 Monitoring. We view active portfolio monitoring as a vital part of our investment process. We consider board observation rights, where appropriate, regular dialogue with company management and sponsors and detailed, internally generated monitoring reports to be critical to our performance. Golub Capital has developed a monitoring template that is designed to reasonably ensure compliance with these standards. This template is used by GC Advisors as a tool to assess investment performance relative to our plan. In addition, our portfolio companies often rely on GC Advisors to provide them with financial and capital markets expertise.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

As part of the monitoring process, GC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal system developed by Golub Capital and its affiliates. This system is not generally accepted in our industry or used by our competitors. It is based on the following categories, which we refer to as GC Advisors internal performance ratings: 
 
 Internal Performance Ratings Rating Definition 5 Involves the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. 4 Involves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. 3 Involves a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased somewhat since origination. The borrower could be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, loan payments are generally not past due. 2 Involves a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments could be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due). 1 Involves a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 1 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered. 
 
 Our internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments. 
 
 For any investment rated 1, 2 or 3, GC Advisors increases its monitoring intensity and prepares regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. 
 
 GC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the internal performance ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, GC Advisors and our board of directors review these internal performance ratings on a quarterly basis. 
 
 The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 internal performance rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2023 and 2022: September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Internal Performance Rating Investments at Fair Value (In thousands) Percentage of Total Investments Investments at Fair Value (In thousands) Percentage of Total Investments 5 16,485 0.6 76,118 3.3 4 2,335,700 89.3 2,153,284 92.9 3 264,699 10.1 82,973 3.6 2 132 0.0 3,728 0.2 1 Total 2,617,016 100.0 2,316,103 100.0

Investment Committee 
 
 The purpose of GC Advisors investment committee, which is comprised of officers of GC Advisors, is to evaluate and approve all of our investments, subject to the oversight of our board of directors. The investment committee process is intended to bring the diverse experience and perspectives of the committee s members to the analysis and consideration of each investment. The investment committee currently consists of Lawrence E. Golub, David B. Golub, Andrew H. Steuerman, Gregory W. Cashman, Spyro G. Alexopoulos, Marc C. Robinson, Robert G. Tuchscherer and Jason J. Van Dussen. The investment committee serves to provide investment consistency and adherence to our core investment philosophy and policies. The investment committee also determines appropriate investment sizing and suggests ongoing monitoring requirements. 
 
 In addition to reviewing investments, investment committee meetings serve as a forum to discuss credit views and outlooks. Potential transactions and deal flow are reviewed on a regular basis. Members of the investment team are encouraged to share information and credit views with the investment committee early in their analysis. We believe this process improves the quality of the analysis and assists the deal team members to work more efficiently. 
 
 Each transaction is presented to the investment committee in a formal written report. Each investment opportunity generally receives the unanimous approval of the investment committee. Each member of the investment committee performs a similar role for other investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles, collectively referred to as accounts, sponsored or managed by Golub Capital and its affiliates. 
 
 Investment Structure 
 
 Once GC Advisors determines that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, GC Advisors typically works with the private equity sponsor, if applicable, the management of that company and its other capital providers to structure our investment. GC Advisors negotiates with these parties to agree on how our investment should be structured relative to other capital in the portfolio company s capital structure. 
 
 GC Advisors structures our investments, which typically have maturities of three to seven years, as follows: 
 
 Senior Secured Loans . GC Advisors structures investments in senior secured loans, where we obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio company that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral often takes the form of first-priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company. Our senior secured loans often provide for moderate loan amortization in the early years of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. Our senior secured loans may include a payment in kind, or PIK, feature. 
 
 One Stop Loans. GC Advisors structures our one-stop loans as senior secured loans. A one-stop loan is a single loan that blends the characteristics of traditional senior debt and traditional junior debt. The structure generally combines the stronger lender protections associated with first lien senior secured debt with the superior economics of junior capital. We obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio company that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral often takes the form of first-priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company. In some cases, one-stop loans are provided to borrowers experiencing high revenue growth supported by a high level of discretionary expenditures. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate. One-stop loans typically provide for moderate loan amortization in the initial years of the facility, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. Our one stop loans may include a PIK feature. One-stop loans generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term and there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. In many cases, we are the sole lender or we, together with our affiliates, are the sole lenders of a one stop loan, which can afford us additional influence over the borrower in terms of monitoring and, if necessary, remediating any underperformance. 

11 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

One stop loans include loans to technology companies undergoing strong growth due to new services, increased adoption and/or entry into new markets. We refer to loans to these companies as recurring revenue loans. Other targeted characteristics of recurring revenue businesses include strong customer revenue retention rates, a diversified customer base and backing from growth equity or venture capital firms. In some cases, the borrower s high revenue growth is supported by a high level of discretionary spending. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate. 
 
 Second Lien Loans. GC Advisors structures these investments as subordinated, secured loans for which our claims on the related collateral are subordinated. We obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio company that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral typically takes the form of second priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. Second lien loans typically provide for minimal loan amortization in the initial years of the facility, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. 
 
 Subordinated Loans. GC Advisors structures these investments as unsecured, subordinated loans that provide for relatively high, fixed interest rates and provide us with significant current interest income. These loans typically have interest-only payments (often representing a combination of cash pay and PIK interest) in the early years, with all or the majority of amortization of principal deferred until loan maturity. Subordinated loans generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term, and there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. 
 
 Second lien loans and subordinated loans are generally more volatile than first lien, senior secured loans and may involve a greater risk of loss of principal. In addition, the PIK feature of many subordinated loans, which effectively operates as negative amortization of loan principal, increases credit risk exposure over the life of the loan. Subordinated loans are more likely to include a PIK feature. 
 Equity Investments. GC Advisors structures these investments as direct or indirect minority equity co-investments in a portfolio company, usually on terms similar to the controlling private equity sponsor and in connection with our loan to such portfolio company. As a result, if a portfolio company appreciates in value, we can achieve additional investment return from these equity co-investments. GC Advisors can structure these equity co-investments to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, which could include a put, or right to sell such securities back to the issuer, upon the occurrence of specified events or demand and piggyback registration rights. However, because these equity co-investments will typically be in private companies, there is no guarantee that we, as a minority-interest holder, will control the timing or value of our realization of any gains on such investments. Our equity co-investments will typically include customary tag-along and/or drag-along rights that will permit or require us to participate in a sale of such equity co-investments at such time as the majority owners, not GC Advisors, determine. 
 GC Advisors tailors the terms of each investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its operating results. GC Advisors seeks to limit the downside potential of our investments by: 
 
 selecting investments that we believe have a very low probability of loss; 
 requiring a total return on our investments that we believe will compensate us appropriately for credit risk; and 
 negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with the preservation of our capital. Such restrictions could include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights. 
 We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may sell some of our investments earlier if a liquidity event occurs, such as a sale, recapitalization or worsening of the credit quality of the portfolio company.

Investments 
 
 We seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily one stop and other senior secured loans by investing approximately 5.0 million to 45.0 million of capital, on average, in the securities of middle-market companies. We also selectively invest more than 45.0 million in some of our portfolio companies and generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. Set forth below is a list of our ten largest portfolio company investments as of September 30, 2023, as well as the top ten industries in which we were invested as of September 30, 2023, calculated as a percentage of our total investments at fair value as of such date.

 Managerial Assistance 
 
 As a business development company, we offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. The Administrator or an affiliate of the Administrator provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. We could receive fees for these services and reimburse the Administrator or an affiliate of the Administrator, as applicable, for 
 13 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

its allocated costs in providing such assistance, subject to the review and approval by our board of directors, including our independent directors. 

Competition 
 
 Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, other business development companies, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a business development company or to the source-of-income, asset diversification and distribution requirements we must satisfy to maintain our qualification as a RIC. 
 
 We use the expertise of the investment professionals of Golub Capital and its affiliates to which we have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, the relationships of the senior members of Golub Capital and its affiliates enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle-market companies in the industries in which we invest. See Risk Factors - Risks Relating to our Business and Structure - We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses. 
 
 Administration 
 
 We do not have any direct employees, and our day-to-day investment operations are managed by GC Advisors. Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our board of directors. We have a chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer, managing director and director of corporate strategy, and to the extent necessary, our board of directors can elect to appoint additional officers going forward. Our officers are officers and/or employees of Golub Capital LLC, an affiliate of GC Advisors, and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs is paid by us pursuant to the administration agreement, or the Administration Agreement, with the Administrator. See Business - Management Agreements - Administration Agreement. 

SUMMARY RISK FACTORS 
 
 The risk factors described below are a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us. These are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other reports and documents filed by us with the SEC. 
 
 We are subject to risks relating to our business and structure 
 
 We are subject to risks associated with the current interest rate environment and to the extent we use debt to finance our investments, changes in interest rates will affect our cost of capital and net investment income. 
 We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses. 
 Rising interest rates could affect the value of our investments and could make it more difficult for portfolio companies to make periodic payments on their loans. 
 We are subject to risks associated with the transition away from LIBOR, which will affect our cost of capital and net investment income. 
 We are dependent upon GC Advisors for our success and upon its access to the investment professionals and partners of Golub Capital and its affiliates.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Our business model depends to a significant extent upon strong referral relationships with sponsors and investing in companies backed by private equity sponsors. Any inability of GC Advisors to maintain or develop these relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business. 
 There are significant potential conflicts of interest as a result of our arrangements with GC Advisors and its affiliates and GC Advisors investment committee that could affect our investment returns. 
 GC Advisors could make certain investment decisions for the purpose of receiving transaction fees. 
 GC Advisors could prioritize its relationship with a borrower or private equity sponsor instead of seeking the most advantageous terms for our investments. 
 GC Advisors operates in multiple business lines and could pursue additional business lines, which could create a conflict of interest in the allocation of its time and focus. 
 Golub Capital could pursue strategic transactions, which could create a conflict of interest in the allocation of GC Advisors time and focus. 
 We and GC Advisors could be the target of litigation or regulatory investigations. 
 We are subject to certain risks related to our ability to qualify as a RIC and to related regulations governing our operation as a business development company. 
 We finance our investments with borrowed money, which will accelerate and increase the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and could increase the risk of investing in us. 
 We are subject to risks associated with the Debt Securitizations and any Credit Facility. 
 Investors in shares of our common stock could fail to fund their capital commitments when due. 
 The majority of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors and, as a result, there could be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments. 
 Our board of directors could change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval. 
 Each of GC Advisors and the Administrator can resign on 60 days notice, and we can provide no assurance that we could find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to risks relating to our investments 
 
 Economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and defaults by our portfolio companies will harm our operating results. 
 Inflation could adversely affect the business, result of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies. 
 Our investments in debt, leveraged portfolio companies, and private and middle-market portfolio companies are risky and we could lose all or part of our investment. 
 The lack of liquidity in our investments could adversely affect our business. 
 Price declines and illiquidity in the corporate debt markets could adversely affect the fair value of our portfolio investments, reducing our net asset value through increased net unrealized depreciation. 
 Our portfolio companies could prepay loans, which could reduce our yields if capital returned cannot be invested in transactions with equal or greater expected yields. 
 We are subject to credit and default risk and our portfolio companies could be unable to repay or refinance outstanding principal on their loans at or prior to maturity. 
 Our portfolio could be concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies and industries, which will subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt instruments or if there is a downturn in a particular industry. 
 We could hold the debt securities of leveraged companies that could, due to the significant volatility of such companies, enter into bankruptcy proceedings. 
 Our failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our portfolio. 
 Because we generally do not hold controlling equity interests in our portfolio companies, we generally will not be able to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments. 
 15 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Our portfolio companies could incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies and such portfolio companies could fail to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations to us. 
 The disposition of our investments could result in contingent liabilities. 
 GC Advisors liability is limited, and we have agreed to indemnify GC Advisors against certain liabilities, which could lead GC Advisors to act in a riskier manner on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account. 
 We could be subject to risks if we engage in hedging transactions and could become subject to risks if we invest in foreign securities. 
 We could suffer losses from our equity investments. 
 We could be subject to lender liability claims with respect to our portfolio company investments. 
 
 Investors are subject to risks relating to an investment in our securities 
 There is no public market for shares of our common stock, and we do not expect there to be a market for shares of our common stock. 
 There are restrictions on the ability of holders of our common stock to transfer shares. 
 Investing in our securities could involve an above average degree of risk. 
 There is a risk that investors in our equity securities will not receive distributions or that our distributions may will not grow over time and a portion of our distributions could be a return of capital. 
 We are subject to risks associated with a Liquidity Event.

MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS 
 GC Advisors is located at 200 Park Avenue, 25th Floor, New York, NY 10166. GC Advisors is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The beneficial interests in GC Advisors are majority owned, indirectly, by two affiliated trusts. The trustees of those trusts are Stephen A. Kepniss and David L. Finegold. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors and in accordance with the 1940 Act, GC Advisors manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory services to us. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, GC Advisors: 
 determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; 
 identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make; 
 executes, closes, services and monitors the investments we make; 
 determines the securities and other assets that we purchase, retain or sell; 
 performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies; and 
 provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds. 
 GC Advisors services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive. Subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act, GC Advisors can enter into one or more sub-advisory agreements under which GC Advisors would obtain assistance in fulfilling its responsibilities under the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
 Management Fee 
 
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay GC Advisors a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components - a base management fee, or Base Management Fee, and an incentive fee, or Incentive Fee. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee is ultimately borne by our stockholders. 
 
 The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate equal to 1.375 of the fair value of our average adjusted gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters (excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds, securitization related assets, and cash collateral on deposit with custodian) and is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is adjusted, based on the actual number of days elapsed relative to the total number of days in such calendar quarter, for any share issuances or repurchases during such calendar quarter. For periods ending on or prior to the date of the closing of a Liquidity Event, GC Advisors has irrevocably agreed to waive any base management fee in excess of 1.00 of the fair value of our average adjusted gross assets as calculated in accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement and as described above. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the term Liquidity Event means the earlier of (1) the date of the pricing of an initial public offering or listing on a national securities exchange of our securities, (2) a distribution to our stockholders of either (a) cash proceeds from an orderly liquidation of our investments or (b) securities or other assets of ours as a distribution-in-kind, or (3) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets to, or other liquidity event with, an entity for consideration of either cash and/or publicly listed securities of the acquirer. 
 
 Incentive Fee 
 
 We pay GC Advisors an incentive fee. The Incentive Fee is calculated in arrears and consists of three parts: (1) the income component, or the Income Incentive Fee, (2) the capital gains component, or the Capital Gain Incentive Fee, and (3) the subordinated liquidation incentive component, or the Subordinated Liquidation Incentive Fee, and are collectively referred to as the Incentive Fee. 
 
 The components of the Incentive Fee are calculated as described below. The Income Incentive Fee is payable quarterly in arrears and the Capital Gain Incentive Fee is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears (or, in each case, upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date). The Subordinated Liquidation Incentive Fee is payable upon a liquidation of GBDC 3. 
 
 Prior to the closing of a Liquidity Event, we will deposit one-third of each Income Incentive Fee and Capital Gain Incentive Fee payment into an escrow account, or the Escrow Account, to be administered by U.S. Bank National Association, or the Escrow Agent. Assets in the Escrow Account will be held by the Escrow Agent until the closing of a Liquidity Event at which time the Escrow Agent will release the assets to GC Advisors. If no Liquidity Event occurs prior 
 17 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

to October 2, 2023, the Escrow Agent will return all assets in the Escrow Account to us for the benefit of our stockholders. 
 
 The fees and expenses of the Escrow Account and the Escrow Agent will be borne by us. 
 
 Incentive Fee Cap 
 
 We have structured the calculation of the Incentive Fee to include a fee limitation such that the Income Incentive Fee and the Capital Gain Incentive Fee will not be paid at any time if, after such payment, the cumulative Income Incentive Fees and Capital Gain Incentive Fees paid to date would exceed an incentive fee cap, or the Incentive Fee Cap. For periods ending on or prior to the date of the closing of a Liquidity Event, the Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter is equal to the difference between (a) 15.0 of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income and (b) cumulative incentive fees of any kind paid to GC Advisors by us since September 29, 2017. For periods beginning after the date of the closing of a Liquidity Event, the Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter will be equal to the difference, if positive, between (a) the sum of (i) 20.0 of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income for the period beginning on the date immediately following the closing of a Liquidity Event and (ii) 15.0 of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income for the period from September 29, 2017 and ending on the date of the closing of a Liquidity Event and (b) cumulative Income Incentive Fees and Capital Gain Incentive Fees paid to GC Advisors by us since September 29, 2017. To the extent the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value in any quarter, no incentive fee would be payable in that quarter. Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income is equal to the sum of (a) Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined below) for each period since September 29, 2017 and (b) cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, cumulative aggregate realized capital losses, cumulative aggregate unrealized capital depreciation and cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation since September 29, 2017. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the calendar quarter (including the base management fee, taxes, any expenses payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, any expenses of securitizations and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock to the extent such amounts are supported by our taxable earnings, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends, and zero coupon securities, accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. GC Advisors does not return to us amounts paid to it on accrued income that we have not yet received in cash if such income is not ultimately received by us in cash. If we do not ultimately receive income, a loss would be recognized, reducing future fees. 
 
 If, for any relevant period, the Incentive Fee Cap calculation results in our paying less than the amount of the Income Incentive fee and the Capital Gain Incentive Fee calculated pursuant to the Income and Capital Gain Incentive Fee Calculation, then the difference between (a) the sum of the Income Incentive Fee and the Capital Gain Incentive Fee and (b) the Incentive Fee Cap will not be paid by us, and will not be received by GC Advisors as an Incentive Fee either at the end of such relevant period or at the end of any future period. For the avoidance of doubt, our stockholders benefit from a reduction in the amount of Incentive Fees that we pay, and that they pay indirectly, equal to the sum of the differences, if any, between (a) the sum of the Income Incentive Fee and the Capital Gain Incentive Fee and (b) the Incentive Fee Cap. 
 
 Income and Capital Gain Incentive Fee Calculation 
 
 The Income and Capital Gain Incentive Fee Calculation has two parts: the Income Incentive Fee component and the Capital Gain Incentive Fee component. The Income Incentive Fee component is calculated quarterly in arrears based on our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. 
 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the Income Incentive Fee component, it is possible that an Incentive Fee may be calculated under this formula with respect to a period in which we have incurred a loss. For example, if we receive Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in excess of the hurdle rate (as defined below) for a calendar quarter, the income component will result in a positive value and an Incentive Fee will be paid even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and/or unrealized capital losses unless the payment of such Incentive Fee would cause us to pay Incentive Fees on a cumulative basis that exceed 20.0 of our Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income. 
 
 18 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a fixed hurdle rate of 1.5 quarterly. If market interest rates rise, we may have the ability to invest funds in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which would increase our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income and make it easier for GC Advisors to surpass the fixed hurdle rate and receive an Income Incentive Fee. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income used to calculate this part of the Incentive Fee is also included in the amount of our total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds and leverage) used to calculate the base management fee. 
 
 We calculate the Income Incentive Fee component of the Income and Capital Gains Incentive Fee Calculation with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income quarterly, in arrears, as follows: 
 
 zero in any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate; 
 50.0 of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than the percentage at which amounts payable to GC Advisors pursuant to the Income Incentive Fee equals 20.0 of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply. We refer to this portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as the catch-up provision; and 
 20.0 of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the catch-up provision in any calendar quarter. 
 The sum of these calculations yields the Income Incentive Fee . This amount is appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the quarter. For periods prior to the closing of a Liquidity Event, GC Advisors agreed to waive that portion of the Income Incentive Fee calculated in excess of the Income Incentive Fee calculated with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income quarterly, in arrears, as follows: 
 
 zero in any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate; 
 50.0 of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than the percentage at which amounts payable to GC Advisors pursuant to the Income Incentive Fee equals 15.0 of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply. We refer to this portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as the catch-up provision; and 
 15.0 of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the catch-up provision in any calendar quarter. 
 The Capital Gain Incentive Fee equals (a) 20.0 of our Capital Gain Incentive Fee Base (as defined below), if any, calculated in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing with the calendar year ending December 31, 2017, less (b) the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gain Incentive Fees. Our Capital Gain Incentive Fee Base equals (1) the sum of (A) our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative positive basis from September 29, 2017 through the end of each calendar year, (B) all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis and (C) all unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less (2) our unamortized deferred financing costs as of the date of calculation, if and to the extent such costs exceed all unrealized capital appreciation on a cumulative basis. 
 
 The cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price of each investment in our portfolio when sold is less than (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. 
 The cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in our portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. 
 The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation is calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in our portfolio as of the applicable Capital Gain Incentive Fee calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Prior to the closing of a Liquidity Event, GC Advisors has agreed to waive that portion of the Capital Gain Incentive Fee, calculated as described above, in excess of 15.0 of the Capital Gain Incentive Fee Base, provided that any amounts so waived shall be deemed to have been paid to GC Advisors for purposes of determining the Capital Gain Incentive Fee payable after the closing of a Liquidity Event. 
 
 Realized capital gains and losses include gains and losses on investments, foreign currencies, including gains and losses on derivative contracts and any income tax related to cumulative aggregate realized gains and losses. There was no Capital Gain Incentive Fee payable as calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement (as described above) for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. However, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we are required to accrue for a capital gain incentive fee on a quarterly basis and are further required to include the aggregate unrealized capital appreciation on investments when calculating the capital gain incentive fee accrual, as if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. If the Capital Gain Incentive Fee Base, adjusted as required by GAAP to include unrealized appreciation, is positive at the end of a period, then GAAP requires us to accrue a capital gain incentive fee equal to 15.0 of such amount prior to the closing of a Liquidity Event (20.0 following the closing of a Liquidity Event), less the aggregate amount of the actual Capital Gain Incentive Fees paid or capital gain incentive fees accrued under GAAP in all prior periods. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. The resulting accrual under GAAP for any capital gain incentive fee payable in a given period may result in additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reversal of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. From inception through September 30, 2023, we have not made any Capital Gain Incentive Fee payments. For the year ended September 30, 2023, we did not accrue a capital gain incentive fee under GAAP. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we accrued (reversed) a capital gain incentive fee, net of waiver, under GAAP of (2.1) million and 2.1 million, respectively. There was no cumulative accrual for capital gain incentive fee, net of waiver under GAAP as of both September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022. 
 
 Subordinated Liquidation Incentive Fee 
 
 The third part of the Incentive Fee, which we refer to as the Subordinated Liquidation Incentive Fee, equals 15.0 of the net proceeds from a liquidation of GBDC 3 in excess of adjusted capital, as calculated immediately prior to liquidation. For purposes of this calculation, (a) liquidation includes any merger of our common stock with another entity or the acquisition of all or substantially all of the shares of our common stock in a single or series of related transactions and (b) adjusted capital means our net asset value calculated immediately prior to liquidation in accordance with GAAP less unrealized capital appreciation that would have been subject to the Capital Gain Incentive Fee had capital gain been recognized on the transfer of such assets in the liquidation. The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that no Subordinated Liquidation Incentive Fee shall be payable for any liquidation that occurs more than six months after the date of an initial public offering of our common stock or a listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange. For periods prior to the date of the closing of a Liquidity Event, GC Advisors has agreed to waive the Subordinated Liquidation Incentive Fee.

 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.35 
 
 (1) The hypothetical amount of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income shown is based on a percentage of total net assets. In addition, the example assumes that during the most recent four full calendar quarter period ending on or prior to the date the payment set forth in the example is to be made, the sum of (a) our aggregate distributions to our stockholders and (b) our change in net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) is at least 6.0 of our net assets at the beginning of such period (as adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases). 
 (2) Represents a quarter of the 6.0 annualized hurdle rate. 
 (3) Excludes offering expenses.

 Example 2 - Capital Gain Incentive Fee: 
 
 Alternative 1 
 
 Assumptions Year 1: 20 million investment made in Company A Investment A and 30 million investment made in Company B Investment B Year 2: Investment A is sold for 15 million and fair market value FMV of Investment B determined to be 29 million Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be 27 million Year 4: Investment B sold for 25 million 
 
 Both prior to and following a Liquidity Event, the Capital Gain Incentive Fee, if any, would be: 
 Year 1: None (No sales transactions) Year 2: None (Sales transaction resulted in a realized capital loss on Investment A) Year 3: None (No sales transactions) Year 4: None (Sales transaction resulted in a realized capital loss on Investment B) 
 
 Each quarterly incentive fee calculated quarterly, in arrears, pursuant to the Income and Capital Gains Incentive Fee Calculation is subject to the Incentive Fee Cap. Below are the necessary adjustments to the Incentive Fee payable to adhere to the Incentive Fee Cap. 
 Year 1: No adjustment; no realized capital losses or unrealized capital depreciation. Year 2: Investment A sold at a 5 million loss. Investment B has unrealized capital depreciation of 1 million. Therefore, GC Advisors would not be paid on the 6 million realized/unrealized loss, which would result in a lower Incentive Fee by 0.9 million prior to a Liquidity Event, or 1.2 million following a Liquidity Event. Year 3: Investment B has unrealized capital depreciation of 2 million. Therefore, GC Advisors would not be paid on the 2 million unrealized capital depreciation, which would result in a lower Incentive Fee by 300,000 prior to a Liquidity Event, or 400,000 following a Liquidity Event. Year 4: Investment B sold at a 5 million loss. Investment B was previously marked down by 3 million; therefore, we would realize a 5 million loss on Investment B and reverse the previous 3 million in unrealized capital depreciation. The net effect would be a loss of 2 million. GC Advisors would not be paid on the 2 million loss, which would result in a lower Incentive Fee by 300,000 prior to a Liquidity Event, or 400,000 following a Liquidity Event.

Therefore, GC Advisors would not be paid on the 7 million unrealized capital depreciation which would result in a lower Incentive Fee by 1.05 million prior to a Liquidity Event, or 1.4 million following a Liquidity Event. Year 3: Investment A sold at a 2 million loss. Investment A was previously marked down by 2 million; therefore, we would realize a 2 million loss on Investment A and reverse the previous 2 million in unrealized capital depreciation. Investment B has additional unrealized capital depreciation of 1 million. The net effect would be a loss of 1 million. GC Advisors would not be paid on the 1 million loss, which would result in a lower Incentive Fee by 150,000 prior to a Liquidity Event, or 200,000 following a Liquidity Event. Year 4: Investment B has additional unrealized capital depreciation of 2 million. Investment C sold at a 1 million realized loss. Therefore, GC Advisors would not be paid on the 3 million realized/unrealized loss, which would result in a lower Incentive Fee by 450,000 prior to a Liquidity Event, or 600,000 following a Liquidity Event. Year 5: Investment B sold at a 10 million loss. Investment B was previously marked down by 8 million; therefore, we would realize a 10 million loss on Investment B and reverse the previous 8 million in unrealized capital depreciation.

 Payment of Our Expenses 
 
 All investment professionals of GC Advisors and/or its affiliates, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of personnel allocable to these services to us, are provided and paid for by GC Advisors and/or its affiliates and not by us. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Expenses. 
 
 Duration and Termination 
 
 Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will continue in effect from year to year if approved annually by our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and, in either case, if also approved by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, of us or GC Advisors. The Investment Advisory Agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, by GC Advisors and could be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days written notice to the other. The holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, by vote, can also terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement without

penalty. See Risk Factors - Risks Relating to our Business and Structure - We are dependent upon GC Advisors for our future success and upon their access to the investment professionals and partners of Golub Capital and its affiliates. 
 
 Indemnification 
 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, GC Advisors and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of GC Advisors services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser. 
 
 Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement 
 
 At a meeting of our board of directors held in May 2023, our board of directors voted unanimously to re-approve the Investment Advisory Agreement. In reaching a decision to approve the Investment Advisory Agreement, the board of directors reviewed a significant amount of information and considered, among other things: 
 
 the nature, extent and quality of services provided to us by GC Advisors; 
 the relative investment performance of us since inception; 
 the relative investment performance of GBDC, GDLC, GBDC 4, and GDLCU; 
 the fees paid by other comparable business development companies; and 
 various other matters. 
 
 Based on the information reviewed and the considerations detailed above, our board of directors, including all of the directors who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, of us or GC Advisors, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates and terms are fair and reasonable in relation to the services provided and approved the Investment Advisory Agreement for a one-year term. 
 
 Administration Agreement 
 
 Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities and equipment and provides clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services at such facilities. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Administrator assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. The Administrator can retain third parties to assist in providing administrative services to us. To the extent that the Administrator outsources any of its functions, we pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without profit to the Administrator. We reimburse the Administrator for the allocable portion (subject to review and approval of our board of directors) of the Administrator s overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. Our board of directors reviews the expenses reimbursed to the Administrator, including any allocation of expenses among us and other entities for which the Administrator provides similar services, to determine that these expenses are reasonable and comparable to administrative services charged by unaffiliated third-party asset managers. In addition, if requested to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, the Administrator is paid an additional amount based on the cost of the services provided, which shall not exceed the amount we receive from such portfolio companies for providing this assistance. In May 2023, the Administration Agreement was renewed for a one-year term with the unanimous approval of our board of directors. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days written notice to the other party.

REGULATION 
 
 General 
 
 We are a business development company under the 1940 Act and have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between business development companies and their affiliates (including any investment advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors of a business development company be persons other than interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we cannot change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a business development company without the approval of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 
 
 We can invest up to 100 of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we could, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an underwriter, as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we could enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate or foreign currency fluctuations. However, we could purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we could acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company in excess of the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments could subject our stockholders to additional expenses. None of these policies, or any of our other policies, is fundamental and each could be changed without stockholder approval. To the extent we adopt any fundamental policies; no person from whom we borrow will have, in his or her capacity as lender or debt holder, either a veto power or a vote in approving or changing any of our fundamental policies.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Qualifying Assets 
 
 Under the 1940 Act, a business development company is restricted from acquiring any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70 of the company s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 
 
 (1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as could be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer that: 
 a is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 
 b is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company, or SBIC, wholly owned by the business development company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 
 c satisfies either of the following: 
 i does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or has any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange subject to a 250.0 million market capitalization maximum; or 
 ii is controlled by a business development company or a group of companies including a business development company, the business development company actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result, the business development company has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company. 
 (2) Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control. 
 (3) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident to such a private transaction, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. 
 (4) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60 of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. 
 (5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. 
 (6) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities that mature in one year or less from the date of investment. 
 The regulations defining and interpreting qualifying assets can change over time. We could adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area. 
 
 We look through our consolidated subsidiaries to the underlying holdings (considered together with portfolio assets held outside of our consolidated subsidiaries) for purposes of determining compliance with the 70 qualifying assets requirement of the 1940 Act. At least 70 of our assets will be eligible assets. 
 
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
 
 A business development company must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70 test, the business development company must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance; except that, when the business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group could make available such managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby 
 29 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

the business development company, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. The Administrator or an affiliate of the Administrator provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. 
 
 Temporary Investments 
 
 Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments could consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70 of our assets are qualifying assets or temporary investments. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, so long as the agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that could be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25 of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would generally not meet the diversification tests described in Section 851(b)(3) of the Code in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. GC Advisors will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
 
 Senior Securities 
 
 We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200 (or 150 upon receipt of certain approvals and subject to the requirement that we make an offer to repurchase the shares of our stockholders) immediately after each such issuance (or such other percentage as could be prescribed by law from time to time). As of September 30, 2023, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 212.55 . 
 
 In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We can also borrow amounts up to 5 of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage, provided that any such borrowings in excess of 5 of the value of our total assets would be subject to the asset coverage ratio requirements of the 1940 Act, even if for temporary or emergency purposes. We consolidate our financial results with all of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including GBDC 3 Funding, GBDC 3 Holdings, the 2022-2 Issuer, the 2022 CLO 2 Depositor, the 2022 Issuer, the 2022 ABS 2022-1 Depositor, the 2021 Issuer, 2021 CLO Depositor, GBDC 3 Holdings Coinvest, Inc., GBDC 3 Holdings ED Coinvest, Inc., GCBH 3 North Haven Stack Buyer Coinvest Inc. and GBDC 3 Quick Quack Coinvest LLC for financial reporting purposes and measure our compliance with the leverage test applicable to business development companies under the 1940 Act on a consolidated basis. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Risk Factors - Risks Relating to our Business and Structure - Regulations governing our operation as a business development company affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital. As a business development company, the necessity of raising additional capital exposes us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage. 
 
 Codes of Ethics 
 
 We and GC Advisors have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code can invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code s requirements. You can read and copy the code of ethics from the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. See Business General Information Available. In addition, each code of ethics is attached as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
 
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to GC Advisors. The proxy voting policies and procedures of GC Advisors are set out below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by GC Advisors and our directors who are not interested persons and, accordingly, are subject to change. 
 
 30 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Introduction 
 
 As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, GC Advisors has a fiduciary duty to act solely in our best interests. As part of this duty, GC Advisors recognizes that it must vote our securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests. 
 
 GC Advisors policies and procedures for voting proxies for its investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 
 
 Proxy Policies 
 
 GC Advisors votes proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what it perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. GC Advisors reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its effect on the portfolio securities we hold. In most cases, GC Advisors will vote in favor of proposals that GC Advisors believes are likely to increase the value of the portfolio securities we hold. Although GC Advisors will generally vote against proposals that could have a negative effect on our portfolio securities, GC Advisors could vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
 
 Our proxy voting decisions are made by GC Advisors chief executive officer and president. To ensure that GC Advisors vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, GC Advisors requires that (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to its chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how GC Advisors intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. Where conflicts of interest could be present, GC Advisors will disclose such conflicts to us, including our independent directors, and could request guidance from us on how to vote such proxies. 
 
 Proxy Voting Records 
 
 You can obtain information without charge about how GC Advisors voted proxies during the most recent 12-month period ended September 30, 2023 by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc., Attention: Investor Relations, 200 Park Avenue, 25th Floor, New York, NY 10166, or by calling Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc. collect at (212) 750-6060. 
 
 Privacy Principles 
 
 We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their nonpublic personal information. 
 
 We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to employees of GC Advisors and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We will maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders. 
 
 Other 
 
 Under the 1940 Act, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a business development company, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person s office. 
 
 We and GC Advisors are required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of relevant federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering these policies and procedures. 
 
 We could also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our board of directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. The SEC has interpreted the business development company prohibition on transactions with affiliates to prohibit joint transactions among entities that share a common investment adviser. The staff of the SEC has 
 31 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

granted no-action relief pursuant to which purchases by us and other accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates of a single class of privately placed securities are permitted provided that the adviser negotiates no term other than price and certain other conditions are met. Any co-investment would be made subject to compliance with existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and our allocation procedures. If opportunities arise that would otherwise be appropriate for us and for another account sponsored or managed by GC Advisors to make different investments in the same issuer, GC Advisors will need to decide which account will proceed with the investment. Moreover, in certain circumstances, we could be unable to invest in an issuer in which another account sponsored or managed by GC Advisors has previously invested. 
 
 On February 27, 2017, GC Advisors and certain other funds and accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors and its affiliates, received exemptive relief from the SEC that permits us greater flexibility to negotiate the terms of co-investments if our board of directors determines that it would be advantageous for us to co-invest with other accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. We believe that co-investment by us and accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors and its affiliates could afford us additional investment opportunities and the ability to achieve greater diversification. Under the terms of this exemptive relief, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors is required to make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment strategies and policies. On January 13, 2023, the SEC issued an order amending the existing co-investment exemptive relief order to incorporate the terms of the temporary, conditional exemptive relief announced by the SEC on April 8, 2020 in order to permit those entities permitted to rely on the order to participate in certain follow-on co-investment transactions. 
 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, imposes a variety of regulatory requirements on companies with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 
 
 pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act our principal executive officer and principal financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 
 pursuant to Item 307 under Regulation S-K under the Securities Act our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; 
 pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and 
 pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 
 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated under such act. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we comply with that act. 
 
 JOBS Act 
 
 We currently are and expect to remain an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, until the earliest of: 
 
 The last day of our fiscal year in which the fifth anniversary of an initial public offering of shares of our common stock occurs; 
 The end of the fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues first exceed 1.235 billion; 
 The date on which we have, during the prior three-year period, issued more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt; and 
 The last day of a fiscal year in which we (1) have an aggregate worldwide market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates of 700 million or more, computed at the end of each fiscal year as of the last business day 
 32 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter and (2) have been an Exchange Act reporting company for at least one year (and filed at least one annual report under the Exchange Act). 
 
 Under the JOBS Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank, we can take advantage of an exemption from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which would require that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, until such time as we cease to be an emerging growth company and become an accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. This could increase the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. 
 
 Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies are eligible to delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have made an irrevocable election not to take advantage of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards. We therefore are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 
 
 Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 
 
 The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to an investment in our shares of common stock. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to such an investment. For example, we have not described certain considerations that could be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including stockholders subject to the alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, traders in securities that elect to mark-to-market their securities holdings, pension plans and trusts, persons that have a functional currency (as defined in Section 985 of the Code) other than the U.S. dollar and financial institutions. This summary assumes that investors hold our common stock as capital assets (within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code). The discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, each as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, regarding any offering of our securities. This summary does not discuss any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. It does not discuss the special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in tax-exempt securities or certain other investment assets. For purposes of this discussion, references to dividends are to dividends within the meaning of the U.S. federal income tax laws and associated regulations and can include amounts subject to treatment as a return of capital under section 19(a) of the 1940 Act. 
 A U.S. stockholder is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: 
 
 a citizen or individual resident of the United States; 
 
 a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 
 
 an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 
 
 a trust if either a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or the trust was in existence on August 20, 1996, was treated as a U.S. person prior to that date, and has made a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person. 
 
 A Non-U.S. stockholder is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is not a U.S. stockholder. 
 
 If a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A prospective investor that is a partner in a partnership that will hold shares of our common stock should consult its tax advisors with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of our common stock. 

33 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences to an investor of an investment in our shares of common stock will depend on the facts of his, her or its particular situation. We encourage investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific consequences of such an investment, including tax reporting requirements, the applicability of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, eligibility for the benefits of any applicable tax treaty, and the effect of any possible changes in the tax laws. 
 
 Election to Be Taxed as a RIC 
 
 As a business development company, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes of an amount at least equal to 90 of our investment company taxable income, which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, or the Annual Distribution Requirement. Although not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must timely distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of the excess (if any) of our realized capital gains over our realized capital losses, or capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), generally for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (3) the sum of any net ordinary income plus capital gains net income for preceding years that were recognized but not distributed during such years and on which we did not incur any liability to pay federal income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. 
 
 Taxation as a RIC 
 
 If we: 
 qualify as a RIC; and 
 satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement; 
 then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain, defined as net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses, we timely distribute as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any net income or net capital gain not distributed as dividends to our stockholders. 
 In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 
 
 qualify and have in effect an election to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; 
 derive in each taxable year at least 90 of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly traded partnerships (partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive 90 of their income from interest, dividends and other permitted RIC income), or the 90 Income Test; and 
 diversify our holdings, so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: 
 at least 50 of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5 of the value of our assets or more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and 
 no more than 25 of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (the Diversification Tests"). 
 34 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

We can invest in partnerships, including qualified publicly traded partnerships, which could result in our being subject to state, local or foreign income, franchise or other tax liabilities. 
 
 In addition, we are subject to ordinary income and capital gain distribution requirements under U.S. federal excise tax rules for each calendar year. If we do not meet the required distributions we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax on the undistributed amount. The failure to meet U.S. federal excise tax distribution requirements will not cause us to lose our RIC status, and we could choose to retain taxable income or capital gains in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year in an amount less than what would trigger payments of federal income tax under Subchapter M of the Code. We could then be required to pay a 4 excise tax on such income or capital gains. 
 
 A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its investment company taxable income. If our deductible expenses in a given taxable year exceed our investment company taxable income, we could incur a net operating loss for that taxable year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent taxable years and such net operating losses do not pass through to its stockholders. In addition, deductible expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. A RIC cannot use any net capital losses (that is, the excess of realized capital losses over realized capital gains) to offset its investment company taxable income, but could carry forward such net capital losses, and use them to offset future capital gains, indefinitely. Due to these limits on deductibility of expenses and net capital losses, we could for tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several taxable years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such taxable income is greater than the net income we actually earn during those taxable years. 
 
 Any underwriting fees paid by us are not deductible in computing our investment company taxable income. We could be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt instruments that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the taxable year of accrual, we could be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. Furthermore, a portfolio company in which we hold equity or debt instruments could face financial difficulty that requires us to work out, modify, or otherwise restructure such equity or debt instruments. Any such restructuring could, depending upon the terms of the restructuring, cause us to incur unusable or nondeductible losses or recognize future non-cash taxable income. 
 
 Certain of our investment practices could be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that could, among other things, (1) treat dividends that would otherwise constitute qualified dividend income as non-qualified dividend income, (2) treat dividends that would otherwise be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction as ineligible for such treatment, (3) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (4) convert lower-taxed long-term capital gain into higher-taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (5) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (6) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (7) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (8) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (9) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90 Income Test. We intend to monitor our transactions and could make certain tax elections to mitigate the effect of these provisions and prevent our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. There can be no assurance that we will be eligible for any such tax elections or that any adverse effects of these provisions will be mitigated. 
 
 Certain distributions reported by us as Section 163(j) interest dividends may be treated as interest income by stockholders for purposes of the tax rules applicable to interest expense limitations under Section 163(j) of the Code. Such treatment by the stockholder is generally subject to holding period requirements and other potential limitations, although the holding period requirements are generally not applicable to dividends declared by money market funds and certain other funds that declare dividends daily and pay such dividends on a monthly or more frequent basis. The amount that we are eligible to report as a Section 163(j) dividend for a tax year is generally limited to the excess of our business interest income over the sum of our (i) business interest expense and (ii) other deductions properly allocable to our business interest income. 
 
 We can invest a portion of our net assets in below investment grade instruments. Investments in these types of instruments can present special tax issues for us. U.S. federal income tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when we can cease to accrue interest, original issue discount or market discount, when and to what extent deductions can be taken for bad debts or worthless instruments, how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated 
 35 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

between principal and income and whether exchanges of debt obligations in a bankruptcy or workout context are taxable. We intend to address these and other issues to the extent necessary in order to seek to ensure that we distribute sufficient income to avoid any material amount of either U.S. federal income tax or 4 nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax. 
 
 Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. 
 
 Our investments in non-U.S. securities could be subject to non-U.S. income, withholding and other taxes. In that case, our yield on those securities would be decreased. U.S. stockholders generally will not be entitled to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit or deduction with respect to non-U.S. taxes paid by us. 
 
 If we acquire shares in a passive foreign investment company PFIC ), we could be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any excess distribution received on, or any gain from the disposition of, such shares even if we distribute such income as a taxable dividend to stockholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest generally will be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from any such excess distribution or gain. If we invest in the shares of a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a qualified electing fund under the Code (a QEF ), in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year our proportionate share of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed by the QEF. Alternatively, we could elect to mark our shares in a PFIC at the end of each taxable year to market; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent that any such decrease does not exceed prior increases in such value included in our income. Our ability to make either election will depend on factors beyond our control, and is subject to restrictions which could limit the availability of the benefit of these elections. Under either election, we could be required to recognize in a taxable year income in excess of any distributions we receive from PFICs and any proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that taxable year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of determining whether we satisfy the distribution requirements under U.S. federal excise tax rules. 
 
 Under Section 988 of the Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time we accrue income, expenses or other liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time we actually collect such income or pay such expenses or liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or loss. Similarly, gains or losses on foreign currency-denominated forward, futures and option contracts, as well as certain other financial instruments, and the disposition of debt obligations denominated in a foreign currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss. 
 
 Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain asset coverage tests are met. See Business - Regulation - Senior Securities. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements could be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our qualification as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we could make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 
 
 Some of the income and fees that we may recognize , such as fees for providing managerial assistance, certain fees earned with respect to our investments, income recognized in a work-out or restructuring of a portfolio investment, or income recognized from an equity investment in an operating partnership, will not satisfy the 90 Income Test. In order to manage the risk that such income and fees might disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy the 90 Income Test, we could be required to recognize such income and fees indirectly through one or more entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations will be subject to U.S. corporate income tax as well as state and local tax on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Failure to Qualify as a RIC 
 
 If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and are unable to cure the failure, for example, by disposing of certain investments quickly or raising additional capital to prevent the loss of RIC status, we generally would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The Code provides some relief from RIC disqualification due to failures to comply with the 90 Income Test and the Diversification Tests, although there could be additional taxes due in such cases. We cannot assure you that we would qualify for any such relief should we fail the 90 Income Test or the Diversification Tests. 
 
 Should failure occur, not only would all our taxable income be subject to tax at regular corporate rates, we would not be able to deduct dividend distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, certain corporate stockholders would be eligible to claim dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends and non-corporate stockholders would generally be able to treat such dividends as qualified dividend income, which is subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC, we could be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (i.e . , the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five taxable years. The remainder of this discussion assumes that we qualify as a RIC and have satisfied the Annual Distribution Requirement. 
 
 Taxation of U.S. Stockholders 
 
 Distributions by us generally are taxable to U.S. stockholders as ordinary income or capital gains. Distributions of our investment company taxable income (which is, generally, our net ordinary income plus net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses) will be taxable as ordinary income to U.S. stockholders to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. To the extent such distributions paid by us to non-corporate stockholders (including individuals) are attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations and certain qualified foreign corporations and if certain holding period requirements are met, such distributions generally will be treated as qualified dividend income and generally eligible for a maximum U.S. federal tax rate of either 15 or 20 , depending on whether the individual shareholder s income exceeds certain threshold amounts, and if other applicable requirements are met, such distributions generally will be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction to the extent such dividends have been paid by a U.S. corporation. In this regard, it is anticipated that distributions paid by us will generally not be attributable to dividends and, therefore, generally will not qualify for the preferential maximum U.S. federal tax rate applicable to non-corporate stockholders as well as will not be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction. 
 Distributions of our net capital gains (which is generally our realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) properly designated by us as capital gain dividends will be taxable to a U.S. stockholder as long-term capital gains (currently generally at a maximum rate of either 15 or 20 , depending on whether the individual shareholder s income exceeds certain threshold amounts) in the case of individuals, trusts or estates, regardless of the U.S. stockholder s holding period for his, her or its common stock and regardless of whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional common stock. Distributions in excess of our earnings and profits first will reduce a U.S. stockholder s adjusted tax basis in such stockholder s common stock and, after the adjusted basis is reduced to zero, will constitute capital gains to such U.S. stockholder. Stockholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares of our common stock purchased in the market should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the stockholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive, and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to such amount. Stockholders receiving dividends in newly issued shares of our common stock will be treated as receiving a distribution equal to the value of the shares received, and should have a cost basis of such amount. 
 Although we currently intend to distribute any net capital gains at least annually, we can in the future decide to retain some or all of our net capital gains but designate the retained amount as a deemed distribution. In that case, among other consequences, we will pay tax on the retained amount, each U.S. stockholder will be required to include their share of the deemed distribution in income as if it had been distributed to the U.S. stockholder, and the U.S. stockholder will be entitled to claim a credit equal to their allocable share of the tax paid on the deemed distribution by us. The amount of the deemed distribution net of such tax will be added to the U.S. stockholder s tax basis for their common stock. Since we expect to pay tax on any retained net capital gains at our regular corporate tax rate, and since that rate is in excess of the 
 37 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

maximum rate currently payable by individuals on long-term capital gains, the amount of tax that individual stockholders will be treated as having paid and for which they will receive a credit will exceed the tax they owe on the retained net capital gain. Such excess generally could be claimed as a credit against the U.S. stockholder s other U.S. federal income tax obligations or could be refunded to the extent it exceeds a stockholder s liability for U.S. federal income tax. A stockholder that is not subject to U.S. federal income tax or otherwise required to file a U.S. federal income tax return would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return on the appropriate form in order to claim a refund for the taxes we paid. In order to utilize the deemed distribution approach, we must provide written notice to our stockholders prior to the expiration of 60 days after the close of the relevant taxable year. We cannot treat any of our investment company taxable income as a deemed distribution. 
 For purposes of determining (1) whether the Annual Distribution Requirement is satisfied for any tax year and (2) the amount of capital gain dividends paid for that tax year, we could, under certain circumstances, elect to treat a dividend that is paid during the following tax year as if it had been paid during the tax year in question. If we make such an election, the U.S. stockholder will still be treated as receiving the dividend in the tax year in which the distribution is made. However, any dividend declared by us in October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to stockholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been received by our U.S. stockholders on December 31 of the calendar year in which the dividend was declared. 
 If an investor purchases shares of our common stock shortly before the record date of a distribution, the price of the shares of our common stock will include the value of the distribution and the investor will be subject to tax on the distribution even though it represents a return of their investment. 
 A U.S. stockholder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss if the stockholder sells or otherwise disposes of their shares of our common stock. Any gain or loss arising from such sale or disposition generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the stockholder has held their shares of common stock for more than one year. Otherwise, it would be classified as short-term capital gain or loss. However, any capital loss arising from the sale or disposition of shares of our common stock held for six months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of the amount of capital gain dividends received, or undistributed capital gain deemed received, with respect to such shares. In addition, all or a portion of any loss recognized upon a disposition of shares of our common stock could be disallowed if other shares of our common stock are purchased (whether through reinvestment of distributions or otherwise) within 30 days before or after the disposition. In such a case, the basis of the common stock acquired will be increased to reflect the disallowed loss. 
 In general, individual U.S. stockholders are subject to a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of either 15 or 20 (depending on whether the individual U.S. stockholder s income exceeds certain threshold amounts) on their net capital gain, i.e. , the excess of realized net long-term capital gain over realized net short-term capital loss for a taxable year, including a long-term capital gain derived from an investment in our shares of common stock. Such rate is lower than the maximum federal income tax rate on ordinary taxable income currently payable by individuals. Corporate U.S. stockholders currently are subject to U.S. federal income tax on net capital gain at the maximum 21 rate also applied to ordinary income. Non-corporate stockholders incurring net capital losses for a tax year i.e. , net capital losses in excess of net capital gains) generally can deduct up to 3,000 of such losses against their ordinary income each tax year; any net capital losses of a non-corporate stockholder in excess of 3,000 generally could be carried forward and used in subsequent tax years as provided in the Code. Corporate stockholders generally cannot deduct any net capital losses for a tax year, but can carry back such losses for three tax years or carry forward such losses for five tax years. 
 We will send to each of our U.S. stockholders, as promptly as possible after the end of each calendar year, a notice detailing, on a per share and per distribution basis, the amounts includible in such U.S. stockholder s taxable income for such year as ordinary income and as long-term capital gain. In addition, the U.S. federal tax status of each calendar year s distributions generally will be reported to the IRS. Distributions can also be subject to additional state, local and foreign taxes depending on a U.S. stockholder s particular situation. Dividends distributed by us generally will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction or the lower tax rates applicable to certain qualified dividends. 
 Until and unless we are treated as a publicly offered regulated investment company (within the meaning of Section 67 of the Code) as a result of either (i) shares of our common stock and our preferred stock collectively being held by at least 500 persons at all times during a taxable year or (ii) shares of our common stock being treated as regularly traded on an established securities market for any taxable year, for purposes of computing the taxable income of U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts or estates, (i) our earnings will be computed without taking into account such U.S. stockholders allocable shares of the management and incentive fees paid to our investment adviser and certain of our other expenses, (ii) each such U.S. stockholder will be treated as having received or accrued a dividend from us in the amount of such U.S. stockholder s allocable share of these fees and expenses for such taxable year, (iii) each 
 38 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

such U.S. stockholder will be treated as having paid or incurred such U.S. stockholder s allocable share of these fees and expenses for the calendar year and (iv) each such U.S. stockholder s allocable share of these fees and expenses will be treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions by such U.S. stockholder. We expect to be treated as a publicly offered regulated company (within the meaning of Section 67 of the Code). For taxable years beginning before 2026, miscellaneous itemized deductions generally are not deductible by a U.S. stockholder that is an individual, trust or estate. For taxable years beginning in 2026 or later, miscellaneous itemized deductions are deductible only to the extent that the aggregate of such U.S. stockholder s miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeds 2 of such U.S. stockholder s adjusted gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, are not deductible for purposes of determining a U.S. stockholder s liability for the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and are subject to the overall limitation on itemized deductions under Section 68 of the Code. 
 Backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24 , could be applicable to all taxable distributions to any non-corporate U.S. stockholder (1) who fails to furnish us with a correct taxpayer identification number or a certificate that such stockholder is exempt from backup withholding or (2) with respect to whom the IRS notifies us that such stockholder has failed to properly report certain interest and dividend income to the IRS and to respond to notices to that effect. An individual s taxpayer identification number is his or her social security number. Any amount withheld under backup withholding is not an additional tax and is generally allowed as a credit against the U.S. stockholder s U.S. federal income tax liability and could entitle such stockholder to a refund, provided that proper information is timely provided to the IRS. 
 If a U.S. stockholder recognizes a loss with respect to shares of our common stock of 2 million or more for an individual stockholder or 10 million or more for a corporate stockholder, the stockholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on Form 8886. Direct stockholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, stockholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer s treatment of the loss is proper. U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their specific circumstances. 
 An additional 3.8 Medicare tax is imposed on certain net investment income (including ordinary dividends and capital gain distributions received from us and net gains from redemptions or other taxable dispositions of our shares) of U.S. individuals, estates and trusts to the extent that such person s modified adjusted gross income (in the case of an individual) or adjusted gross income (in the case of an estate or trust) exceeds certain threshold amounts. 
 Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders 
 Whether an investment in the shares of our common stock is appropriate for a Non-U.S. stockholder will depend upon that person s particular circumstances. An investment in the shares of our common stock by a Non-U.S. stockholder could have adverse tax consequences. Non-U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisors before investing in our common stock. 
 Subject to the discussion below, distributions of our investment company taxable income to Non-U.S. stockholders (including interest income, net short-term capital gain or foreign-source dividend and interest income, which generally would be free of withholding if paid to Non-U.S. stockholders directly) will be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a 30 rate (or lower rate provided by an applicable treaty) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits unless the distributions are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. stockholder, in which case the distributions will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the rates applicable to U.S. persons. In that case, we will not be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax if the Non-U.S. stockholder complies with applicable certification and disclosure requirements. Special certification requirements apply to a Non-U.S. stockholder that is a foreign partnership or a foreign trust, and such entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors. 
 Certain properly reported dividends received by a Non-U.S. stockholder generally are exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax when they (1) are paid in respect of our qualified net interest income (generally, our U.S.-source interest income, other than certain contingent interest and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which we or the non-U.S. stockholder are at least a 10 stockholder, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income), or (2) are paid in connection with our qualified short-term capital gains (generally, the excess of our net short-term capital gain over our long-term capital loss for a tax year) as well as if certain other requirements are satisfied. Nevertheless, it should be noted that in the case of shares of our stock held through an intermediary, the intermediary could have withheld U.S. federal income tax even if we reported the payment as an interest-related dividend or short-term capital gain dividend. Moreover, depending on the circumstances, we could report all, some or none of our potentially eligible dividends as derived from such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains, or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Actual or deemed distributions of our net capital gains to a Non-U.S. stockholder, and gains realized by a Non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale of our common stock, will not be subject to federal withholding tax and generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless the distributions or gains, as the case could be, are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. stockholder and, if an income tax treaty applies, are attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. stockholder in the United States or, in the case of an individual Non-U.S. stockholder, the stockholder is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the year of the sale or capital gain dividend and certain other conditions are met. 
 If we distribute our net capital gains in the form of deemed rather than actual distributions (which we could do in the future), a Non-U.S. stockholder will be entitled to a U.S. federal income tax credit or tax refund equal to the stockholder s allocable share of the tax we pay on the capital gains deemed to have been distributed. In order to obtain the refund, the Non-U.S. stockholder must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and file a U.S. federal income tax return even if the Non-U.S. stockholder would not otherwise be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number or file a U.S. federal income tax return. For a corporate Non-U.S. stockholder, distributions (both actual and deemed), and gains realized upon the sale of our common stock that are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business could, under certain circumstances, be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate (or at a lower rate if provided for by an applicable treaty). 
 A Non-U.S. stockholder who is a non-resident alien individual, and who is otherwise subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax, could be subject to information reporting and backup withholding of U.S. federal income tax on dividends unless the Non-U.S. stockholder provides us or the dividend paying agent with a U.S. nonresident withholding tax certification (e.g., an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or an acceptable substitute form) or otherwise meets documentary evidence requirements for establishing that it is a Non-U.S. stockholder or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. 
 Pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, the applicable withholding agent is generally required to withhold U.S. tax (at a 30 rate) with respect to payments of dividends made to certain non-U.S. entities that fail to comply (or be deemed compliant) with extensive reporting and withholding requirements designed to inform the U.S. Department of the Treasury of U.S.-owned foreign investment accounts. The information required to be reported include the identity and taxpayer identification number of each account holder and transaction activity within the holder s account. Stockholders could be requested to provide additional information to enable the applicable withholding agent to determine whether withholding is required. 
 An investment in shares by a non-U.S. person could also be subject to U.S. federal estate tax. Non-U.S. persons should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax, U.S. federal estate tax, withholding tax, and state, local and foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning or disposing of our common stock.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other reports and documents filed by us with the SEC. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not presently deemed material by us could also impair our operations and performance. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, our net asset value could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risk factors described below are the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us as well as those factors generally associated with an investment company with investment objectives, investment policies, capital structure or trading markets similar to ours.

Based on our outstanding indebtedness of 1,240.9 million as of September 30, 2023 and the effective annual interest rate of 7.36 as of that date, our investment portfolio would have been required to experience an annual return of at least 7.19 to cover annual interest payments on the outstanding debt. 
 If we are unable to obtain leverage or if the interest rates of such leverage are not attractive, we could experience diminished returns. The number of leverage providers and the total amount of financing available could decrease or remain static. We could, directly or through subsidiaries, have concentrated exposure to a small number of commercial lenders or other financing providers, which could result in us being dependent on the continued availability of capital from such financing providers. Consequently, available financing could be more expensive or on terms that are less desirable than in an environment with a larger number of leverage providers. 
 As a business development company, we generally are required to meet the asset coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings and other senior securities, which include our borrowings and any preferred stock that we could issue in the future, that is applicable to us under the 1940 Act. Currently, this asset coverage ratio is 200 . However, Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act reduces the asset coverage requirement applicable to business development companies from 200 to

 Market Information 
 
 Until the completion of a Liquidity Event, our outstanding common stock will be offered and sold in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act under Section 4(a)(2) and Regulation D. There is no public market for our common stock currently, nor can we give any assurance that one will develop. 
 
 Because shares of our common stock have been acquired by investors in one or more transactions not involving a public offering, they are restricted securities and may be required to be held indefinitely. Such shares may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise disposed of unless (i) our consent is granted, and (ii) the shares are registered under applicable securities laws or specifically exempted from registration (in which case the stockholder may, at our option, be required to provide us with a legal opinion, in form and substance satisfactory to us, that registration is not required). Accordingly, an investor must be willing to bear the economic risk of investment in the shares until we are liquidated. No sale, transfer, assignment, pledge or other disposition, whether voluntary or involuntary, of the shares may be made except by registration of the transfer on our books. Each transferee will be required to execute an instrument agreeing to be bound by these restrictions and the other restrictions imposed on the shares and to execute such other instruments or certifications as are reasonably required by us. 
 
 Holders 
 
 As of November 30, 2023, we had 1,265 stockholders of record. 
 
 Distributions 
 
 Our distributions, if any, are determined by the board of directors. We elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we must distribute to our stockholders dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes each year of an amount at least equal to 90 of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of our net long-term capital losses, or investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. In addition, we are subject to ordinary income and capital gain distributions requirement under U.S. federal excise tax rules for each calendar year. If we do not meet the required distributions we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax on the undistributed amount.

 We currently intend to distribute net capital gains i.e ., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually out of the assets legally available for such distributions. However, we may decide in the future to retain such capital gains for investment and elect to treat such gains as deemed distributions to you. If this happens, you will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as if you had received an actual distribution of the capital gains that we retain and reinvested the net after tax proceeds in us. In this situation, you would be eligible to claim a tax credit (or, in certain circumstances, a tax refund) equal to your allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to you. See Item 1. Business - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Taxation of U.S. Stockholders . We cannot assure you that we will achieve results that will permit us to pay any cash distributions, and if we issue senior securities, we will be prohibited from making distributions if doing so would cause us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the 1940 Act or if such distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings. 
 
 Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 
 
 Except as previously reported by us on our current reports on Form 8-K, we did not sell any securities during the period covered by this Form 10-K that were not registered under the Securities Act. 
 
 We are party to subscription agreements with several investors, including affiliates of GC Advisors, providing for the private placement of our common stock, or the Subscription Agreements. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase our common stock, at a price per share equal to the most recent net asset value per share as determined by our board of directors (subject to adjustment to the extent required by Section 23 of the 1940 Act), up to the amount of their respective capital subscriptions on an as-needed basis as determined by us with a minimum of 10 calendar days prior notice. Common stock issued pursuant to the Subscription Agreements are exempt from registration under the Securities Act, applicable U.S. state securities laws and the laws of any non-U.S. jurisdictions by virtue of the private placement exemption from registration provided in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

Overview 
 
 We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a business development company and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code. We were formed in August 2017 and commenced operations on October 2, 2017. 

Our investment activities are managed by GC Advisors and supervised by our board of directors of which a majority of the members are independent of us, GC Advisors and its affiliates. 
 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay GC Advisors an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. The Investment Advisory Agreement was most recently approved by our board of directors in May 2023. Under the Administration Agreement, we are provided with certain administrative services by an administrator, or the Administrator, which is currently Golub Capital LLC. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our independent directors) of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement. 
 
 We seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily one stop and other senior secured loans by primarily investing approximately 5.0 million to 45.0 million of capital, on average, in the securities of U.S. middle-market companies. We also selectively invest more than 45.0 million in some of our portfolio companies and generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. 
 
 We generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which are often referred to as junk, have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which may increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, our portfolio at fair value was comprised of the following: As of September 30, 2023 As of September 30, 2022 Investment Type Investments at Fair Value (In thousands) Percentage of Total Investments Investments at Fair Value (In thousands) Percentage of Total Investments Senior secured 234,332 9.0 240,945 10.4 One stop 2,213,560 84.6 1,931,622 83.3 Second lien 11,743 0.4 8,878 0.4 Subordinated debt 16,205 0.6 10,571 0.5 Equity 141,176 5.4 124,087 5.4 Total 2,617,016 100.0 2,316,103 100.0 
 
 One stop loans include loans to technology companies undergoing strong growth due to new services, increased adoption and/or entry into new markets. We refer to loans to these companies as recurring revenue loans. Other targeted characteristics of recurring revenue businesses include strong customer revenue retention rates, a diversified customer base and backing from growth equity or venture capital firms. In some cases, the borrower s high revenue growth is supported by a high level of discretionary spending. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, one stop loans included 326.0 million and 273.1 million, respectively, of recurring revenue loans at fair value. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we had debt and equity investments in 291 and 271 portfolio companies, respectively. 
 
 The following table shows the weighted average income yield and weighted average investment income yield of our earning portfolio company investments, which represented nearly 100 of our debt investments, as well as the total return based on our average net asset value and the total return based on the change in the net asset value of our stock and assuming distributions were reinvested in accordance with our dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, in each case for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: 
 Years ended September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Weighted average income yield (1) 
 11.2 7.4 Weighted average investment income yield (2) 
 11.5 7.8 Total return based on average net asset value (3) 
 9.3 5.7 
 
 (1) Represents income from interest, fees, accrued PIK and non-cash dividend income, excluding amortization of capitalized fees and discounts, divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us. 
 (2) Represents income from interest, fees, accrued PIK and non-cash dividend income and amortization of capitalized fees and discounts, divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us. 
 (3) Total return based on average net asset value is calculated as (a) the net increase/(decrease) in net assets resulting from operations divided by (b) the daily average of total net assets. Total return does not include sales load. 
 As of September 30, 2023, GBDC 3 has earned an inception-to-date internal rate of return, or IRR, of 8.4 for stockholders taken as a whole. An individual stockholder s IRR may vary based on the timing of their capital transactions. For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, GBDC 3 earned a fiscal year-to-date IRR of 9.6 and 7.1 , respectively, for stockholders taken as a whole. The IRR is the annualized effective compound rate of return that brings a series of cash flows to the current value of the cash invested. The IRR was computed based on the actual dates of cash inflows (share issuances, including share issuances through the DRIP), outflows (capital distributions), the stockholders' net asset value, or NAV, at the end of the period and distributions declared and payable at the end of the period (residual value of the stockholders NAV and distributions payable as of each measurement date).

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Revenues: We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, one stop, second lien or subordinated loans, typically have a term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. 
 
 In addition, we generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, administrative agent fees and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. For additional details on revenues, see Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment or derivative instrument, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments and derivative instruments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Expenses: Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to GC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including: 
 
 reimbursement to GC Advisors of organizational and offering expenses up to an aggregate amount of 0.7 million; 
 calculating our NAV (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); 
 fees and expenses incurred by GC Advisors payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments, which fees and expenses include, among other items, due diligence reports, appraisal reports, any studies commissioned by GC Advisors and travel and lodging expenses; 
 expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts; 
 administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs); 
 fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies, including costs associated with meeting financial sponsors; 
 transfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses; 
 U.S. federal and state registration and franchise fees; 
 U.S. federal, state and local taxes; 
 independent directors fees and expenses; 
 costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by the SEC or other regulators; 
 costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs; 
 costs associated with individual or group stockholders; 
 costs associated with compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
 our allocable portion of any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs; 
 proxy voting expenses; and 
 all other expenses incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business. 
 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines. 
 
 GC Advisors, as collateral manager for the 2021 Issuer under the 2021 Collateral Management Agreement is entitled to receive an annual fee in an amount equal to 0.35 of the principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the 2021 Issuer at the beginning of the collection period relating to each payment date, which is payable in arrears on each payment date. Under the 2021 Collateral Management Agreement, the term collection period refers to the period commencing on the tenth business day prior to the preceding payment date and ending on (but excluding) the tenth business day prior to such payment date. 
 
 GC Advisors, as collateral manager for our indirect, wholly owned, consolidated subsidiary, Golub Capital BDC 3 ABS 2022-1 LLC, or the 2022 Issuer, under the 2022-2 Collateral Management Agreement is entitled to receive an annual fee in an amount equal to 0.35 of the principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the 2022 Issuer at the beginning of the collection period relating to each payment date, which is payable in arrears on each payment date. Under the 2022 Collateral Management Agreement, the term collection period relating to any payment date, refers to the period commencing on the tenth business day prior to the preceding payment date and ending on (but excluding) the tenth business day prior to such payment date. 
 
 GC Advisors, as collateral manager for our indirect, wholly owned, consolidated subsidiary, Golub Capital BDC 3 CLO 2 LLC, or the 2022-2 Issuer, under the 2022-2 Collateral Management Agreement is entitled to receive an annual fee in an amount equal to 0.35 of the principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the 2022-2 Issuer at the beginning of the collection period relating to each payment date, which is payable in arrears on each payment date. Under the 2022-2 Collateral Management Agreement, the term collection period refers to the period commencing on the tenth business day prior to the preceding payment date and ending on (but excluding) the tenth business day prior to such payment date. 
 
 Collateral management fees are paid directly by the 2021 Issuer, the 2022 Issuer and the 2022-2 Issuer and are offset against the management fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. In addition, the 2021 Issuer and the 2022 Issuer paid Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, structuring and placement fees for its services in connection with the structuring of the 2021 Debt Securitization and the 2022 Debt Securitization (as defined in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements). The 2022-2 Issuer paid GreensLedge Capital Markets LLC and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. structuring and placement fees for its services in connection with the structuring of the 2022-2 Debt Securitization (as defined in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements). Term debt securitizations, are also known as collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs. Term debt securitization and asset backed securitizations are a form of secured financing incurred by us, which are consolidated by us and subject to our overall asset coverage requirement. The 2021 Issuer, the 2022 Issuer and the 2022-2 Issuer also agreed to pay ongoing administrative expenses to the trustee, collateral manager, independent accountants, legal counsel, rating agencies and independent managers in connection with developing and maintaining reports, and providing required services in connection with the administration of the 2021 Debt Securitization, 2022 Debt Securitization and 2022-2 Debt Securitization, respectively. 
 
 We believe that these administrative expenses approximate the amount of ongoing fees and expenses that we would be required to pay in connection with a traditional secured credit facility. Our common stockholders indirectly bear all of these expenses. 
 
 LIBOR Transition 
 
 In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, or the FCA, announced its intention to cease sustaining the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, by the end of 2021. 
 
 87 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Following their publication on June 30, 2023, no settings of the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, continue to be published on a representative basis and publication of many non-U.S. dollar LIBOR settings has been entirely discontinued. 
 
 On December 21, 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-06 (or ASU 2022-06 ), which deferred the sunset of Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform, until December 31, 2024. The issuance of ASU 2022-06 and the deferral of the sunset of Topic 848 eases the potential burden in accounting for the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. 
 
 On July 29, 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve System, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, formally recommended replacing U.S.-dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. In April 2018, the Bank of England began publishing its proposed alternative rate, the Sterling Overnight Index Average, or SONIA. Each of SOFR and SONIA significantly differ from LIBOR, both in the actual rate and how it is calculated. 
 
 Further, on March 15, 2022, the Consolidation Appropriations Act of 2022, which includes the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, or the LIBOR Act, was signed into law in the United States. This legislation establishes a uniform benchmark replacement process for certain financial contracts that mature after June 30, 2023 that do not contain clearly defined or practicable LIBOR fallback provisions. The legislation also creates a safe harbor that shields lenders from litigation if they choose to utilize a replacement rate recommended by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. 
 
 In addition, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, which regulates the publisher of LIBOR (ICE Benchmark Administration) has announced that it will require the continued publication of the one-, three- and six-month tenors of U.S.-dollar LIBOR on a non-representative synthetic basis until the end of September 2024, which may result in certain non-U.S. law-governed contracts and U.S. law-governed contracts not covered by the federal legislation remaining on synthetic U.S.-dollar LIBOR until the end of this period. 
 
 Although the transition process away from LIBOR has become increasingly well-defined (e.g., the LIBOR Act now provides a uniform benchmark replacement for certain LIBOR-based instruments in the United States), the transition process is complex and it could cause a disruption in the credit markets generally and could have adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations, including, among other things, increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that continue to rely on LIBOR or which have been transitioned away from LIBOR to a different rate like SOFR and, in any case, could result in a reduction in the value of certain investments held by us. 
 
 In anticipation of the discontinuation of LIBOR, we assessed our debt facilities for our exposure to LIBOR. On June 24, 2022, the DB Credit Facility was amended to utilize a benchmark interest rate of thre e-month term SOFR and foreign alternative reference rates for U.S. dollar and foreign borrowings, respectively. The notes offered in the 2021 Debt Securitization, the 2022 Debt Securitization and the 2022-2 Debt Securitization currently utilize a reference rate to three-month term SOFR. We expect any new debt facilities that we enter into subsequent to September 30, 2023 will reference a benchmark interest rate other than LIBOR, such as SOFR. 

Recent Developments

Consolidated Results of Operations 
 
 The comparison of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 can be found in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 located within Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 89 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Consolidated operating results for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 are as follows: 
 Years ended Variances September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 2023 vs. 2022 
 (In thousands) Interest income 243,903 135,819 108,084 Payment-in-kind interest income 14,515 5,740 8,775 Accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums 8,088 7,933 155 Non-cash dividend income 8,443 8,443 Dividend income 20 112 (92) Fee income 631 2,208 (1,577) Total investment income 275,600 151,812 123,788 Net expenses 141,828 68,903 72,925 Net investment income before tax 133,772 82,909 50,863 Excise tax 630 630 Net investment income after tax 133,142 82,909 50,233 Net realized gain (loss) on investment transactions 384 2,441 (2,057) Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions (9,745) (21,950) 12,205 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations 123,781 63,400 60,381 Average earning portfolio company investments, at fair value 2,323,490 1,948,478 375,012 Average earning preferred equity investments, at fair value 64,852 55,591 9,261 
 
 Net income can vary substantially from period to period for various reasons, including the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation. In addition, as we have continued to raise and deploy capital, we have experienced significant growth in total assets, total liabilities and net assets during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. As a result, annual comparisons of operating results may not be meaningful. 
 
 Investment Income 
 
 Investment income increased from the year ended September 30, 2022 to the year ended September 30, 2023 by 123.8 million, primarily due to an increase in interest income due to rising LIBOR and SOFR interest base rates coupled with an increase in the average earning debt investments balance of 375.0 million and an increase in non-cash dividend income. 
 
 The annualized income yield by debt security type for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 are as follows: 
 
 Years ended September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Senior secured 9.9 6.3 One stop 11.1 7.5 Second lien 13.7 8.8 Subordinated debt 
 15.6 14.4 
 
 Income yields on senior secured and one stop loans increased for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to rising LIBOR and SOFR rates. Our loan portfolio is partially insulated from a drop in floating interest rates as 97.9 of the loan portfolio at fair value is subject to an interest rate floor. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the weighted average base rate floor of our loans was 0.79 and 0.80 , respectively . 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, we have second lien investments in four portfolio companies and subordinated debt investments in three portfolio companies as shown in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. Due to the limited number of second lien and subordinated debt investments, income yields on second lien and subordinated debt investments can be significantly impacted by the addition, subtraction or refinancing of one investment.

 Expenses 
 
 The following table summarizes our expenses for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: 
 
 Years ended Variances September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 2023 vs. 2022 (In thousands) Interest and facility fee expenses 83,614 30,754 52,860 Amortization of debt issuance costs 3,500 3,466 34 Base management fee, net of waiver 24,957 20,502 4,455 Income incentive fee, net of waiver 23,496 12,032 11,464 Capital gain incentive fee accrued under GAAP, net of waiver (2,141) 2,141 Professional fees 2,109 1,455 654 Administrative service fee 3,618 2,361 1,257 General and administrative expenses 534 474 60 Net expenses 141,828 68,903 72,925 Average debt outstanding 1,184,310 980,605 203,705 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest and other debt financing expenses, including amortization of debt issuance costs, increased by 52.9 million from the year ended September 30, 2022 to the year ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding of 203.7 million as well as rising LIBOR and SOFR rates on borrowings from our floating rate debt facilities. 
 
 For more information about our outstanding borrowings for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, including the terms thereof, see Note 8. Borrowings in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the effective annualized average interest rate, which includes amortization of debt financing costs and non-usage facility fees, on our total debt was 7.4 and 3.5 , respectively. The increase in the effective average interest rate for the year ended September 30, 2022 to the year ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to rising LIBOR and SOFR base interest rates on our floating rate debt facilities and, to a lesser extent, increased interest rate spreads made in connection with amendments on our revolving credit facilities and new debt securitizations during fiscal year 2023. 
 
 Management Fees 
 
 The base management fee, net of waiver, increased as a result of an increase in average gross assets for the year ended September 30, 2022 to the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Incentive Fees 
 
 The incentive fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement consists of two parts: (1) the Income Incentive Fee and (2) the Capital Gains Incentive Fee. 
 
 The Income Incentive Fee, net of waiver, increased by 11.5 million from the year ended September 30, 2022 to the year ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements) and a greater rate of return on the value of our net assets driven by net funds growth, the impact of rising LIBOR and SOFR rates and an increase in non-cash dividend income during fiscal year 2023. For the year ended September 30, 2022, we remained in the Income Incentive Fee catch-up provision of the calculation and an increase in Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income caused a corresponding increase in the Income Incentive Fee. 
 
 91 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 The Income Incentive Fee as a percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, net of waiver, was 15.0 and 13.0 for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 Effective April 1, 2022, GC Advisors changed its practice of retaining administrative agent fees earned in respect of co-investment transactions in which we participate. In connection with this change, for the three months ended March 31, 2022, GC Advisors voluntarily and irrevocably waived 0.7 million 1 of the Income Incentive Fee related to certain administrative agent fees received by GC Advisors prior to this change. The waiver had the net economic effect of providing us an amount equal to our pro rata portion of administrative agent fees earned by GC Advisors from our borrowers. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, there was no Capital Gain Incentive Fee payable as calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement. In accordance with GAAP, we are required to include the aggregate unrealized capital appreciation on investments in the calculation and accrue a capital gain incentive fee as if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the Capital Gain Incentive Fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. As of September 30, 2023, there was no capital gain incentive fee accrual calculated in accordance with GAAP. For the year ended September 30, 2023, there was no accrual of capital gain incentive fee under GAAP. 
 
 As of September 30, 2022, there was no capital gain incentive fee accrual calculated in accordance with GAAP, net of waiver. For the year ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a reversal of capital gain incentive fee under GAAP, net of waiver of 2.1 million, which was primarily the result of unrealized depreciation on portfolio company investments during the period. Any payment due under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement is calculated in arrears at the end of each calendar year. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, no Capital Gain Incentive Fees have been payable as calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
 
 For additional details on unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments, refer to the Net Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses see section below. 
 
 Professional Fees, Administrative Service Fee and General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 In total, professional fees, the administrative service fee, and general and administrative expenses increased by 2.0 million from the year ended September 30, 2022 to the year ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher professional fees and administrative expenses associated with servicing a growing portfolio. 
 
 The Administrator pays for certain expenses incurred by us. These expenses are subsequently reimbursed in cash. Total expenses reimbursed to the Administrator during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were 2.9 million and 1.7 million, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, included in accounts payable and accrued expenses were 0.9 million and 0.7 million, respectively, of expenses paid on behalf of us by the Administrator. 

1 The net economic effect represents 0.9 million of GBDC 3 s pro rata portion of administrative agent fees retained by GC Advisors since GBDC 3 commenced operations on October 2, 2017, reduced by 0.2 million of the additional incentive fees GC Advisors would have earned on the pro rata portion of administrative agent fees.

 Net Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses 
 
 The following table summarizes our net realized and unrealized gains (losses) for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: 
 
 Years ended Variances September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 2023 vs. 2022 (In thousands) Net realized gain (loss) from investments (321) 2,064 (2,385) Net realized gain (loss) from foreign currency transactions (210) 377 (587) Net realized gain (loss) from forward currency contracts 915 915 Net realized gain (loss) on investment transactions 384 2,441 (2,057) Unrealized appreciation from investments 24,296 11,701 12,595 Unrealized (depreciation) from investments (34,460) (32,105) (2,355) Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) from forward currency contracts (10,804) 20,154 (30,958) Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency translation 11,223 (21,700) 32,923 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions (9,745) (21,950) 12,205 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2023, we had a net realized gain of 0.4 million, primarily driven by realized gains on the sale of equity investments in multiple portfolio companies and the gain on the settlement of forward currency contracts that were partially offset by a realized loss recognized on the restructure of a portfolio company debt investment. During the year ended September 30, 2022, we had a net realized gain of 2.4 million, primarily due to realized gains on the sale of equity investments in multiple portfolio companies, and to a lesser extent, by recognized realized gains from foreign currency transactions. 
 
 For the year ended September 30, 2023, we had 24.3 million in unrealized appreciation on 143 portfolio company investments, which was offset by 34.5 million in unrealized depreciation on 165 portfolio company investments. For the year ended September 30, 2022, we had 11.7 million in unrealized appreciation on 102 portfolio company investments, which was offset by 32.1 million in unrealized depreciation on 211 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended September 30, 2023 primarily resulted from the reversal of unrealized depreciation from the restructuring of a portfolio company investment, loan repayments and improved performance of certain portfolio companies. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily resulted from better than expected performance of our portfolio companies. 
 
 Unrealized depreciation for the year ended September 30, 2023 primarily resulted from decreases in the fair value across our portfolio company investments due to incremental spread widening in the market during the first quarter of the 2023 fiscal year, isolated deterioration in the credit performance of a small number of portfolio companies and, to a lesser extent, the reversal of unrealized appreciation associated with the sale of portfolio company equity investments. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily resulted from decreases in the fair value in the majority of our portfolio company investments due to wider credit spreads in the market during the last two quarters of the 2022 fiscal year, amortization of discounts and the reversal of unrealized appreciation recognized in connection with realized gains on the sale of portfolio company investments. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 For the year ended September 30, 2023, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents, foreign currencies, restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted foreign currencies of 0.8 million. During the period, we used 164.8 million in operating activities, primarily as a result of fundings of portfolio investments of 447.8 million, which was partially offset by proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments of 181.4 million. During the same period, cash provided by financing activities was 165.6 million, primarily driven by borrowings on debt of 719.8 million and proceeds from the issuance of common shares of 116.7 million, that were partially offset by repayments of debt of 601.0 million and distributions paid of 65.4 million.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 For the year ended September 30, 2022, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents, foreign currencies, restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted foreign currencies of 23.1 million. During the period, we used 829.5 million in operating activities, primarily as a result of fundings of portfolio investments of 1,171.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments of 263.7 million. During the same period, cash provided by financing activities was 806.4 million, primarily driven by borrowings on debt of 1,246.2 million and proceeds from the issuance of common shares of 442.1 million, that were partially offset by repayments of debt of 819.7 million and distributions paid of 58.8 million. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of 9.5 million and 16.3 million, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we had foreign currencies of 1.1 million and 1.3 million, respectively, restricted cash and cash equivalents of 55.7 million and 45.7 million, respectively, and restricted foreign currencies of 0.5 million and 2.7 million, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents and foreign currencies are available to fund new investments, pay operating expenses and pay distributions. Restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted foreign currencies can be used to pay principal and interest on borrowings and to fund new investments that meet the guidelines under our debt securitizations or credit facilities, as applicable. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we had investor capital subscriptions totaling 1,387.9 million and 1,388.3 million, respectively, of which 1,328.6 million and 1,209.8 million, respectively, had been called and contributed, leaving 59.4 million and 178.5 million of uncalled investor capital subscriptions, respectively. 
 
 Revolving Debt Facilities 
 
 SB Revolver - On January 27, 2023, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the SB Revolver (as defined in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements), following which the agreements governing the SB Revolver were terminated. As of September 30, 2022, we had 100.0 million of debt outstanding and, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions, no remaining commitments and no availability on the SB Revolver. As of September 30, 2022, we could borrow up to 100.0 million on the SB Revolver. 
 
 DB Credit Facility - On March 8, 2023, we entered into an amendment on the DB Credit Facility to, among other things, decrease the aggregate borrowing capacity from 750.0 million to 625.0 million, extend the Revolving Period (as defined in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements) from March 10, 2023 to March 10, 2024 and amend the interest rate at which borrowings are made to the applicable base rate plus 2.55 during the Revolving Period and 3.05 after the Revolving Period. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the DB Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements) allowed our wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary, GBDC 3 Funding, to borrow up to 625.0 million and 750.0 million, respectively, at any one time outstanding, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we had 465.9 million and 469.0 million outstanding under the DB Credit Facility, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions, we had approximately 159.1 million and 281.0 million of remaining commitments, respectively, and 68.4 million and 30.7 million of availability on the DB Credit Facility, respectively. 
 
 Adviser Revolver - On September 1, 2023, we entered into an amendment on the Adviser Revolver (as defined in Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements) to, among other things, increase the borrowing capacity from 40.0 million to 100.0 million, extend the maturity date to September 1, 2026, and to allow for borrowings in non-U.S. currencies. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we were permitted to borrow up to 100.0 million and 40.0 million, respectively, at any one time outstanding under the Adviser Revolver.

 consolidation. As of September 30, 2023, we had outstanding debt under the 2022-2 Debt Securitization of 225.0 million. 
 
 2022 Debt Securitization - On January 25, 2022, we completed the 2022 Debt Securitization.

 2021 Debt Securitization - On March 11, 2021, we completed the 2021 Debt Securitization. The Class A, Class B, Class C-1, and Class C-2 2021 Notes are included in the September 30, 2023 Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as our debt and the Class D and Subordinated 2021 Notes were eliminated in consolidation. As of both September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we had outstanding debt under the 2021 Debt Securitization of 298.0 million. 
 
 Asset Coverage, Contractual Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Liquidity Considerations 
 
 In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are currently allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200 after such borrowing. We have not sought or obtained approval to reduce our asset coverage ratio as permitted by and subject to the requirements of Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act and, as a result, remain subject to the 200 asset coverage requirement under Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act. We currently intend to continue to target a GAAP debt-to-equity ratio of 0.85x. As of September 30, 2023, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 212.6 . 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments totaling 176.0 million, including 22.5 million of unfunded commitments on revolvers. As of September 30, 2022, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments totaling 308.1 million, including 24.0 million of unfunded commitments on revolvers. There is no guarantee that these amounts will be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but the entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers, subject to the terms of each loan s respective credit agreement as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. A summary of maturity requirements for our principal borrowings as of September 30, 2023 is included in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements. We did not have any other material contractual payment obligations as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, we believe that we had sufficient assets and liquidity to adequately cover future obligations under our unfunded commitments based on historical rates of drawings upon unfunded commitments and cash and restricted cash balances that we maintain, availability under our DB Credit Facility and Adviser Revolver, as well as ongoing principal repayments on debt investment assets and uncalled investor capital subscriptions. 
 
 In addition, we have entered and, in the future, may again enter into derivative instruments that contain elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. Refer to Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements for outstanding forward currency contracts as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022. Derivative instruments can be affected by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, which could impact the fair value of the derivative instruments. If market conditions move against us, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the derivative instruments and may realize a loss. We minimize market risk through monitoring our investments and borrowings. 
 
 Although we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from capital calls on existing and future investor capital subscriptions and through our dividend reinvestment plan as well as future borrowings, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, we cannot assure you that our efforts to raise capital will be successful. In addition, from time to time, we can amend, refinance, or enter into new leverage facilities and securitization financings, to the extent permitted by applicable law. In addition to capital not being available, it also could not be available on favorable terms. To the extent we are not able to raise capital on what we believe are favorable terms, we will focus on optimizing returns by investing capital generated from repayments into 
 new investments we believe are attractive from a risk/reward perspective. Furthermore, to the extent we are not able to raise capital and are at or near our targeted leverage ratios, we expect to receive smaller allocations, if any, on new investment opportunities under GC Advisors allocation policy.

As of September 30, 2022, 97.9 and 98.0 , respectively, of our debt portfolio at amortized cost and at fair value had interest rate floors that limit the minimum applicable interest rates on such loans. 
 As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the portfolio median 1 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for our portfolio companies was 61.4 million and 54.5 million , respectively. The portfolio median EBITDA is based on the most recently reported trailing twelve-month EBITDA received from the portfolio company. 
 
 As part of the monitoring process, GC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal system developed by Golub Capital and its affiliates. This system is not generally accepted in our industry or used by our competitors. It is based on the following categories, which we refer to as GC Advisors internal performance ratings: Internal Performance Ratings Rating Definition 5 Involves the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. 4 Involves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. 3 Involves a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased somewhat since origination. The borrower could be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, loan payments are generally not past due. 2 Involves a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments could be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due). 1 Involves a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 1 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered. 
 
 Our internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments. 
 
 For any investment rated 1, 2 or 3, GC Advisors will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. 
 
 GC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the internal performance ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, GC Advisors and our board of directors review these internal performance ratings on a quarterly basis. 
 
 1 The portfolio median EBITDA is based on our portfolio of debt investments and excludes (i) portfolio companies with negative or de minimis EBITDA, (ii) investments designated as recurring revenue loans and (iii) portfolio companies with any loans on non-accrual status.

Distributions 
 
 We intend to make periodic distributions to our stockholders as determined by our board of directors. For additional details on distributions, see Income taxes in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Updates to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of our distributions from time to time. In addition, the asset coverage requirements applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act could limit our ability to make distributions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including the possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions. 
 
 Because federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations can differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences are permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified within capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. For example, permanent differences in classification result from the treatment of distributions paid from short-term gains as ordinary income dividends for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. 
 
 To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any tax year, a portion of those distributions could be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders could be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains. 
 
 We have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, our stockholders cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our 
 98 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 common stock unless a stockholder specifically opts out of our dividend reinvestment plan. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders participating in our dividend reinvestment plan will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes.

For example, GC Advisors presently serves as the investment adviser to Golub Capital BDC, Inc., or GBDC, a publicly-traded business development company (Nasdaq: GBDC), Golub Capital Direct Lending Corporation, or GDLC, Golub Capital BDC 4, Inc., or GBDC 4, Golub Capital Direct Lending Unlevered Corporation, or GDLCU, and Golub Capital Private Credit Fund, or GCRED, which are business development companies that primarily focus on investing in one stop and other senior secured loans. In addition, our officers and directors serve in similar capacities for GBDC, GDLC, GDLCU, GBDC 4 and GCRED. If GC Advisors and its affiliates determine that an investment is appropriate for us, GBDC, GDLC, GDLCU, GBDC 4, GCRED and other accounts, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, and pursuant to GC Advisors allocation policy, GC Advisors or its affiliates could determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other accounts. We do not intend to make any investments if they are not permitted by applicable law

 and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, or if they are inconsistent with GC Advisors allocation procedures. 
 
 In addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our and GC Advisors officers, directors and employees. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 
 We value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under our valuation policy and process. 
 
 Valuation methods include comparisons of the portfolio companies to peer companies that are public, determination of the enterprise value of a portfolio company, discounted cash flow analysis and a market interest rate approach. The factors that are taken into account in fair value pricing investments include: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables; applicable market yields and multiples; security covenants; call protection provisions; information rights; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows and the markets in which it does business; comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public; comparable merger and acquisition transactions; and the principal market and enterprise values. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments can differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and differ materially from values that are ultimately received or settled. 
 
 Our board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination. 
 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 
 Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of GC Advisors responsible for credit monitoring. Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and GC Advisors. The audit committee of our board of directors reviews these preliminary valuations. At least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment, subject to a de minimis threshold, is reviewed by an independent valuation firm. The board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith. 
 
 Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Under current accounting standards, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 We follow ASC Topic 820 for measuring fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
 100 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the assets or liabilities or market and the assets or liabilities complexity. Our fair value analysis includes an analysis of the value of any unfunded loan commitments. Assets and liabilities are categorized 
 for disclosure purposes based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. The valuation hierarchical levels are based upon the transparency of the inputs to the valuation of the asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: 
 
 Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 
 
 Level 2: Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
 
 Level 3: Inputs include significant unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the assets or liabilities. The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information available and may require significant management judgment or estimation. 
 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an asset s or a liability s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and we consider factors specific to the asset or liability. We assess the levels of assets and liabilities at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfers. There were no transfers among Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The following section describes the valuation techniques used by us to measure different assets and liabilities at fair value and includes the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the assets and liabilities are categorized. 

Valuation of Investments 
 
 Level 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our board of directors to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with approximately 25 (based on the number of portfolio companies) of our valuations of debt and equity investments without readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm. All investments as of both September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 were valued using Level 3 inputs. As of both September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, all money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents were valued using Level 1 inputs and all forward currency contracts were valued using Level 2 inputs. 
 
 When determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, we may take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made and other relevant factors. The primary method for determining enterprise value uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company s EBITDA. A portfolio company s EBITDA may include pro-forma adjustments for items such as acquisitions, divestitures, or expense reductions. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, we will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, we use a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value. 
 101 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

In addition, for certain debt investments, we may base our valuation on indicative bid and ask prices provided by an independent third-party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that we and others may be willing to pay. Ask prices represent the lowest price that we and others may be willing to accept. We generally use the midpoint of the bid/ask range as our best estimate of fair value of such investment. 
 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded. 
 
 Our investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded. 
 
 Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, as recently amended, the board of directors of a registered investment company or BDC is permitted to delegate to a valuation designee, which could be its investment adviser, the responsibility to determine fair value of investments in good faith subject to the oversight of the board. Our board of directors has determined to continue its determination of fair value of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available in accordance with our valuation policies and procedures and has not designated GC Advisors or any other entity as a valuation designee. 
 
 In connection with each sale of shares of our common stock, we make a determination that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price below the then-current net asset value per share of common stock at the time at which the sale is made or otherwise in violation of the 1940 Act. GC Advisors will consider the following factors, among others, in making such determination: 
 
 The net asset value of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report filed with the SEC; 
 Its assessment of whether any change in the net asset value per share of our common stock has occurred (including through the realization of gains on the sale of portfolio securities) during the period beginning on the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value per share of our common stock and ending two days prior to the date of the sale; and 
 The magnitude of the difference between the sale price of the shares of common stock and management s assessment of any change in the net asset value per share of our common stock during the period discussed above.

 Valuation of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities 
 
 The fair value of our debt is estimated using Level 3 inputs by discounting remaining payments using comparable market rates or market quotes for similar instruments at the measurement date, if available. 
 
 Revenue Recognition: 
 
 Our revenue recognition policies are as follows: 
 
 Investments and Related Investment Income: Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual interest terms of debt investments. Premiums, discounts, and origination fees are amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment. For investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not likely to be collectible. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, administrative agent fees, consulting fees and prepayment premiums on loans and record these fees as fee income when earned. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. We have certain preferred equity securities in our portfolio that contain a PIK dividend provision that are accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The accrued PIK and non-cash dividends are capitalized to the cost basis of the preferred equity security and are generally collected when redeemed by the issuer. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Distributions received from limited liability company, or LLC, and limited partnership, or LP, investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment. 
 
 We account for investment transactions on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We report changes in fair value of investments from the prior period that is measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and fluctuations arising from the translation of foreign exchange rates on investments in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on translation of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Non-accrual loans: Loans may be left on accrual status during the period we are pursuing repayment of the loan. Management reviews all loans that become past due 90 days or more on principal and interest or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected for possible placement on non-accrual status. We generally reverse accrued interest when a loan is placed on non-accrual. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. We restore non-accrual loans to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in our management s judgment, are likely to remain current. The total fair value of our non-accrual loans was 3.6 million and 2.0 million as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. 
 
 Income taxes: We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we are required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements, as well as timely distribute to our stockholders dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, for each tax year. We have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders, which will generally relieve us from U.S. federal income taxes. 
 103 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. We may then be required to incur a 4 excise tax on such income. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the year ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 0.6 million for U.S. federal excise tax. For the year ended September 30, 2022, we did not record any U.S. federal excise tax. 
 
 Because federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified within capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. For example, permanent differences in classification may result from the treatment of distributions paid from short-term gains as ordinary income dividends for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future.

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Many of the loans in our portfolio have floating interest rates, and we expect that our loans in the future may also have floating interest rates. These loans are usually based on floating SOFR or another base rate and typically have interest rate reset provisions that adjust applicable interest rates under such loans to current market rates on a daily, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis. The loans that are subject to floating SOFR or another base rate are also typically subject to a minimum base rate, or floor, that we charge on our loans if the current market rates are below the respective floors. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the weighted average floor on loans subject to floating interest rates was 0.79 and 0.80 , respectively. The DB Credit Facility has a floating interest rate provision equal to three-month term SOFR + 2.55 , the Adviser Revolver has a floating interest rate provision equal to the short-term Applicable Federal Rate, the Class A Notes and Class A Loans issued in connection with the 2022-2 Debt Securitization have floating rate provisions based on three-month term SOFR, the Class A Senior Secured Notes issued in connection with the 2022 Debt Securitization have floating rate interest provisions based on three-month term SOFR and the Class A, B, and C-1 2021 Notes issued in connection with the 2021 Debt Securitization have floating rate interest provisions based on three-month SOFR plus a spread adjustment. We expect that other credit facilities into which we enter in the future could have floating interest rate provisions. 
 
 Assuming that the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as of September 30, 2023 were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter interest rate sensitivity as of such date, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates. Change in interest rates Increase (decrease) in 
 interest income (1) 
 Increase (decrease) in interest expense Net increase (decrease) in investment income (In thousands) Down 200 basis points (50,212) (24,618) (25,594) Down 150 basis points (37,659) (18,464) (19,195) Down 100 basis points (25,105) (12,309) (12,796) Down 50 basis points (12,553) (6,155) (6,398) Up 50 basis points 12,553 6,155 6,398 Up 100 basis points 25,105 12,309 12,796 Up 150 basis points 37,659 18,464 19,195 Up 200 basis points 50,212 24,618 25,594 
 
 (1) Assumes applicable three-month base rate as of September 30, 2023, with the exception of SONIA and Prime that utilize the September 30, 2023 rate. 
 
 Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes as of September 30, 2023, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments, including borrowings under the DB Credit Facility, the Adviser Revolver, the Debt Securitizations or other borrowings, that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. Accordingly, we can offer no assurances that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above. 
 
 We could in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts to the limited extent permitted under the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates.

 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 The management of Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc. GBDC 3, and collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company, we, us, our and Golub Capital BDC 3 is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
 Golub Capital BDC 3 s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions recorded necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our policies and procedures also provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of Golub Capital BDC 3, and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness as to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of Golub Capital BDC 3 s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued in 2013. Based on the assessment, management believes that, as of September 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company), including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations, changes in its net assets, and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of investments owned as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, by correspondence with the custodians, the underlying investees and broker. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 of the fair value of the average adjusted gross assets of the Company at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters (including assets purchased with borrowed funds, securitization-related assets, leverage, unrealized depreciation or appreciation on derivative instruments and cash collateral on deposit for such derivative instruments with custodian, but adjusted to exclude cash and cash equivalents so that investors do not pay the base management fee on such assets) and is payable quarterly in arrears. Additionally, the Investment Adviser voluntarily excludes any assets funded with secured borrowing proceeds from the base management fee calculation. The base management fee is adjusted, based on the actual number of days elapsed relative to the total number of days in such calendar quarter, for any share issuances or repurchases during such calendar quarter. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, cash equivalents mean U.S. government securities and commercial paper instruments maturing within 270 days of purchase (which is different than the GAAP definition, which defines cash equivalents as U.S. government securities and commercial paper instruments maturing within 90 days of purchase). To the extent that the Investment Adviser

of the fair value of the Company s average adjusted gross assets as calculated in accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement as described above. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the base management fees incurred by the Company were , and , respectively, and the base management fees irrevocably waived by the Investment Adviser were , and , respectively. 
 
 The Incentive Fee consists of three parts: the income component (the Income Incentive Fee ), the capital gains component (the Capital Gain Incentive Fee and the subordinated liquidation incentive component (the Subordinated Liquidation Incentive Fee and, together with the Income Incentive Fee and the Capital Gain Incentive Fee, the Incentive Fee ). 
 
 The Income Incentive Fee is calculated quarterly in arrears based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the calendar quarter (including the base management fee, taxes, any expenses payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, any expenses of securitizations and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero coupon securities, accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. 
 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the Income Incentive Fee, it is possible that an Incentive Fee is calculated under this formula with respect to a period in which the Company has incurred a loss. For example, if the Company receives Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in excess of the hurdle rate (as defined below) for a calendar quarter, the Income Incentive Fee will result in a positive value, and an Income Incentive Fee will be paid even if the Company has incurred a loss in such period due to realized and/or unrealized capital losses unless the payment of such Income Incentive Fee would cause the Company to pay Income Incentive Fees and Capital Gain Incentive Fees on a cumulative basis that exceed the Incentive Fee Cap described below. 
 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any Incentive Fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a fixed hurdle rate of quarterly. If market interest rates rise, it is possible that the Company will be able to invest funds in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which would increase the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income and make it easier for the Investment Adviser to surpass the fixed hurdle rate and receive an Income Incentive Fee. The Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income used to calculate this part of the Incentive Fee is also included in the amount of the Company s total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds, securitization-related assets, unrealized depreciation or appreciation on derivative instruments and cash collateral on deposit with custodian) used to calculate the base management fee.

of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than the percentage at which amounts payable to the Investment Adviser pursuant to the Income Incentive Fee equal of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income that exceeds the hurdle rate as if a hurdle rate did not apply. This portion of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income that exceeds the hurdle rate is referred to as the catch-up provision; and 
 of the amount of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the catch-up provision in any calendar quarter. 
 
 The sum of these calculations yields the Income Incentive Fee. This amount is appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the quarter. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Income Incentive Fee incurred was , and , respectively. 
 
 For periods ending on or prior to the date of the closing of a Liquidity Event, the Investment Adviser has agreed to irrevocably waive that portion of the Income Incentive Fee calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement in amounts in excess of the following amounts (computed on a quarterly basis, in arrears): 
 
 Zero in any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate; 
 of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than the percentage at which the amount payable to the Investment Adviser equals to of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply. This portion of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income that exceeds the hurdle rate is referred to as the catch-up provision; and 
 of the amount of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the catch-up provision in any calendar quarter. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Income Incentive Fee irrevocably waived by the Investment Adviser was , and , respectively. 
 
 The second part of the Incentive Fee, the Capital Gain Incentive Fee, equals (a) of the Company s Capital Gain Incentive Fee Base (as defined below), if any, calculated in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or, upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), which commenced with the calendar year ended December 31, 2017, less (b) the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gain Incentive Fees. The Company s Capital Gain Incentive Fee Base equals (1) the sum of (A) realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative positive basis from September 29, 2017, the date the Company elected to be a BDC, through the end of each calendar year, (B) all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis and (C) all unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less (2) all unamortized deferred debt issuance costs as of the date of calculation, if and to the extent such costs exceed all unrealized capital appreciation on a cumulative basis. 
 
 The cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price of each investment in the Company s portfolio when sold is less than (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. 
 The cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in the Company s portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.

of the Capital Gain Incentive Fee Base, provided that any amounts so waived shall be deemed paid to the Investment Adviser for purposes of determining the Capital Gain Incentive Fee payable after the closing of a public offering or listing. 
 
 Realized capital gains and losses include gains and losses on investments, foreign currencies, including gains and losses on borrowings in foreign currencies, derivative contracts and any income tax related to cumulative aggregate realized gains and losses. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company did accrue a Capital Gain Incentive Fee. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, there was Capital Gain Incentive Fee payable as calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement as described above. Any payment due for a Capital Gain Incentive Fee under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement is calculated in arrears at the end of each calendar year. 
 
 In accordance with GAAP, the Company also is required to include the aggregate unrealized capital appreciation on investments in the calculation and accrue a capital gain incentive fee on a quarterly basis, as if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, as applicable. If the Capital Gain Incentive Fee Base, adjusted as required by GAAP to include unrealized capital appreciation, is positive at the end of a period, then GAAP requires the Company to accrue a capital gain incentive fee equal to prior to a Liquidity Event following a Liquidity Event) of such amount, less the aggregate amount of the actual Capital Gain Incentive Fees paid and capital gain incentive fees accrued under GAAP in all prior periods. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. The resulting accrual under GAAP in a given period results in additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reversal of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. There was no accrual of the capital gain incentive fee under GAAP for the year ended September 30, 2023. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the accrual (reversal) of the capital gain incentive fee under GAAP was ) and , respectively. There was no accrual of the capital gain incentive fee waiver under GAAP for the year ended September 30, 2023. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the accrual (reversal) of the capital gain incentive fee waiver under GAAP was ) and , respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, there was no accrual for the capital gain incentive fee (net of waiver) under GAAP included in management and incentive fees payable on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
 
 The third part of the Incentive Fee, the Subordinated Liquidation Incentive Fee, equals of the net proceeds from a liquidation of the Company in excess of adjusted capital, as calculated immediately prior to liquidation. For purposes of this calculation, (a) liquidation includes any merger of the Company with another entity or the acquisition of all or substantially all of the shares of the Company s common stock in a single or series of related transactions and (b) adjusted capital means the net asset value of the Company calculated immediately prior to liquidation in accordance with GAAP less unrealized capital appreciation that would have been subject to the Capital Gain Incentive Fee had capital gain been recognized on the transfer of such assets in the liquidation. The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that no Subordinated Liquidation Incentive Fee shall be payable for any liquidation that occurs more than six months after the date of an initial public offering of the Company s common stock or a listing of the Company s common stock on a national securities exchange. For periods prior to the date of the closing of a Liquidity Event, the Investment Adviser has agreed to waive the Subordinated Liquidation Incentive Fee.

of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income and (b) cumulative incentive fees of any kind paid to the Investment Adviser by the Company since September 29, 2017. For periods beginning after the date of the closing of a Liquidity Event, the Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter will be equal to the difference, if positive, between (a) the sum of (i) of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income for the period beginning on the date immediately following the closing of a Liquidity Event and (ii) of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income for the period from September 29, 2017 and ending on the date of the closing of a Liquidity Event and (b) cumulative Income Incentive Fees and Capital Gain Incentive Fees paid to the Investment Adviser by the Company from September 29, 2017. 
 
 To the extent the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value in any quarter, no incentive fee would be payable in that quarter. Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income is equal to the sum of (a) Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for each period since September 29, 2017 and (b) cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, cumulative aggregate realized capital losses, cumulative aggregate unrealized capital depreciation and cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation since September 29, 2017. 
 
 The sum of the Income Incentive Fee, the Capital Gain Incentive Fee and the Subordinated Liquidation Incentive Fee is the Incentive Fee. Prior to the closing of a Liquidity Event, the Company will deposit one-third of each Income Incentive Fee and Capital Gain Incentive Fee payment into an escrow account (the Escrow Account to be administered by U.S. Bank National Association (the Escrow Agent ). Assets in the Escrow Account will be held by the Escrow Agent until the closing of a Liquidity Event at which time the Escrow Agent will release the assets to the Investment Adviser. If no Liquidity Event occurs prior to October 2, 2023, the Escrow Agent will return all assets in the Escrow Account to the Company for the benefit of the stockholders.

 The above tables are not intended to be all-inclusive but rather to provide information on significant unobservable inputs and valuation techniques used by the Company. 
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s debt and equity investments are EBITDA multiples, revenue multiples and market interest rates. The Company uses EBITDA multiples and, to a lesser extent, revenue multiples on its debt and equity investments to determine any credit gains or losses. Increases or decreases in either of these inputs in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The Company uses market interest rates for loans to determine if the effective yield on a loan is commensurate with the market yields for that type of loan. If a loan s effective yield was significantly less than the market yield for a similar loan with a similar credit profile, then the resulting fair value of the loan may have been lower. 
 
 Other Financial Assets and Liabilities 
 
 ASC Topic 820 requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate such value. As a result, with the exception of the line item titled debt which is reported at cost, all assets and liabilities approximate fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition due to their short maturity. Fair value of the Company s debt is estimated using Level 3 inputs by discounting remaining payments using applicable implied market rates.

 Capital losses in excess of capital gains earned in a tax year may generally be carried forward and used to offset capital gains, subject to certain limitations. Capital losses incurred by the Company are not subject to expiration and retain their character as either short-term or long-term capital losses. As of September 30, 2023, the Company estimates that it will not have a capital loss carryforward available for use in subsequent tax years. 
 
 For tax purposes, the Company may elect to defer any portion of a post-October capital loss or late-year ordinary loss to the first day of the following fiscal year. As of both September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company did elect to defer any ordinary losses, short-term capital losses and long-term capital losses. As of September 30, 2021, the Company elected to defer of ordinary losses and did not elect to defer short-term capital losses and long-term capital losses. 
 
 For the tax year ended September 30, 2023, the Company estimates taxable income in excess of the distributions made from such taxable income during the tax year, and therefore, the Company has elected to carry forward the excess for distribution to stockholders in tax year September 30, 2024. The amount carried forward to tax year September 30, 2024 is estimated to be approximately of ordinary income and of long term capital gain, although these amounts will not be finalized until the September 30, 2023 tax returns are filed in 2024.

 Indemnifications: In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties that provide general indemnifications. The Company s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as these involve future claims against the Company that have not occurred. The Company expects the risk of any future obligations under these indemnifications to be remote. 
 
 Off-balance sheet risk: Off-balance sheet risk refers to an unrecorded potential liability that may result in a future obligation or loss, even though it does not appear on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Company has entered and, in the future, could again enter into derivative instruments that contain elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. Refer to Note 6. Forward Currency Contracts for outstanding forward currency contracts as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022. Derivative instruments can be affected by market conditions, such as interest rate and foreign currency volatility, which could impact the fair value of the derivative instruments. If market conditions move against the Company, it may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the derivative instruments and may realize a loss. The Company minimizes market risk through monitoring its investments and borrowings. 
 
 Concentration of credit and counterparty risk: Credit risk arises primarily from the potential inability of counterparties to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Company has engaged, and in the future may engage again, in derivative transactions with counterparties. In the event that the counterparties do not fulfill their obligations, the Company may be exposed to risk. The risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparties or issuers of the instruments. The Company s maximum loss that it could incur related to counterparty risk on its derivative instruments is the value of the collateral for that respective derivative instrument. It is the Company s policy to review, as necessary, the credit standing of each counterparty. 
 
 Legal proceedings: In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that are generally incidental to its ongoing operations. While there can be no assurance of the ultimate disposition of any such proceedings, the Company does not believe any disposition will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Based on that evaluation, our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that, at the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports. There has not been any change in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Exhibit 4.2 
 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc., a Maryland corporation we, our, us or the Company ), had one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act our common stock, par value 0.001 per share. 
 
 For purposes of this exhibit, references to we, our and us refer only to Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc. and not to any of its current or future subsidiaries and references to subsidiaries refer only to consolidated subsidiaries of and exclude any investments held by Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc. in the ordinary course of business which are not, under GAAP, consolidated on the financial statements of Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this Description of Securities is attached as an exhibit. 
 
 The following description is based on relevant portions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the MGCL and on our charter and bylaws, each of which is filed as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.2 is a part. This summary is not necessarily complete, and we refer you to the MGCL and our charter and bylaws for a more detailed description of the provisions summarized below. 
 
 Capital Stock 
 
 Our authorized stock consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.001 per share. There is currently no market for our common stock, and we can offer no assurances that a market for our shares will develop in the future. There are no outstanding options or warrants to purchase our stock. No stock has been authorized for issuance under any equity compensation plans. Under Maryland law, our stockholders generally are not personally liable for our debts or obligations. 
 
 The following are our outstanding classes of securities as of September 30, 2023 
 
 (1) Title of Class (2) Amount Authorized (3) Amount Held by us or for Our Account (4) Amount Outstanding Exclusive of Amounts Shown Under (3) Common Stock 100,000,000 94,630,773.096 Preferred Stock 1,000,000 
 
 Under our charter, our board of directors is authorized to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock and authorize the issuance of shares of stock without obtaining stockholder approval. As permitted by the MGCL, our charter provides that the board of directors, without any action by our stockholders, can amend the charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue. 
 
 All shares of our common stock have equal rights as to earnings, assets, dividends and other distributions and voting and, when they are issued, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Distributions are paid to the holders of our common stock if, as and when authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of assets legally available therefor. Shares of our common stock have no preemptive, exchange, conversion or redemption rights and are freely transferable, except when their transfer is restricted by federal and state securities laws or by contract. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each share of our common stock would be entitled to share ratably in all of our assets that are legally available for distribution after we pay all debts and other liabilities and subject to any preferential rights of holders of our preferred stock, if any preferred stock is outstanding at such time. Each share of our common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors. Except as provided with respect to any other class or series of stock, the holders of our common stock will possess exclusive voting power. There is no cumulative voting in the 
 1 

election of directors, which means that holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock can elect all of our directors, and holders of less than a majority of such shares will not be able to elect any directors. 
 
 Transfer and Resale Restrictions 
 
 We have sold and continue to offer shares of our common stock in a private placement in the United States under the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder, Regulation S under the Securities Act and other exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Investors who acquire shares of our common stock in our private placement are required to complete, execute and deliver a subscription agreement and related documentation, which includes customary representations and warranties, certain covenants and restrictions and indemnification provisions. Additionally, such investors could be required to provide due diligence information for compliance with certain legal requirements. We, from time to time, engage placement or distribution agents and incur placement or distribution fees or sales commissions in connection with the private placement of our common stock in certain jurisdictions outside the United States. The cost of any such placement or distribution fees could be borne by an affiliate of the Adviser. We will not incur any such fees or commissions if our net proceeds received upon a sale of our common stock after such costs would be less than the net asset value per share of our common stock. 
 
 Prior to a Liquidity Event (as defined below), no transfer of capital commitments of investors in the private placement of our common stock or all or any portion of our investors shares of our common stock can be made without (a) registration of the transfer on our books and (b) our prior written consent. In any event, our consent can be withheld (1) if the creditworthiness of the proposed transferee, as determined by us in our sole discretion, is not sufficient to satisfy all obligations under the applicable subscription agreement or (2) unless, in the opinion of counsel satisfactory in form and substance to us 
 
 such transfer would not violate the Securities Act or any state (or other jurisdiction) securities or blue sky laws applicable to us or the shares to be transferred and 
 
 in the case of a transfer to 
 
 an employee benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA ), that is subject to ERISA 
 a plan described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code 
 an entity that is, or is deemed to be, using (for purposes of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) plan assets to purchase or hold its investments or 
 a person (including an entity) that has discretionary authority or control with respect to our assets or a person who provides investment advice with respect to our assets or an affiliate of such person, 
 
 such transfer would not be a prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or cause all or any portion of our assets to constitute plan assets under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. 
 
 A Liquidity Event is defined as any of the following (1) an initial public offering of our common stock or the listing of shares of our common stock on a national securities exchange or (2) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets to, or other liquidity event with, an entity for consideration of either cash and or publicly listed securities of the acquirer, which potential acquirers may include business development companies, including business development companies affiliated with the Adviser, and entities that are not business development companies. 
 
 In addition, prior to a registration of our shares sufficient to cause us to treat our shares as a publicly-offered security for purposes of the Plan Assets Regulation, we intend to limit investment by certain benefit plan investors so as to attempt to avoid our assets from being deemed to be plan assets for purposes of ERISA or Section 4975 of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). We can reject any transfer of shares if such transfer 
 2 

could (i) cause all or any portion of the assets of the company to constitute plan assets under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or (ii) constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or a non-exempt violation of any law that is substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. 
 
 Any person that acquires shares of our common stock in a transfer permitted under a subscription agreement is obligated to pay to us the appropriate portion of any amounts thereafter becoming due in respect of the capital commitment committed to be made by its predecessor in interest. An investor will remain liable for their capital commitments prior to the time, if any, when the purchaser, assignee or transferee of such shares, or fraction thereof, becomes a holder of such shares. 
 
 Furthermore, should there be an initial public offering of our common stock or listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange, holders of our common stock will be subject to lock-up restrictions pursuant to which they will be prohibited from selling shares of our common stock for a minimum of 180 days after the pricing of such initial public offering or the listing. The specific terms of this restriction and any other limitations on the sale of our common stock in connection with or following an initial public offering will be agreed in advance between our board of directors and the Adviser, acting on behalf of our investors, and the underwriters of the initial public offering or other similar institutions, acting on our behalf, in connection with a listing. 
 
 Provisions of the MGCL and Our Charter and Bylaws 
 
 Limitation on Liability of Directors and Officers Indemnification and Advance of Expenses 
 
 The MGCL permits a Maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation and its stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from (a) actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services or (b) active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action. Our charter contains such a provision which eliminates directors and officers liability to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). 
 
 Our charter authorizes us, to the maximum extent permitted by the MGCL and subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act, to obligate us to indemnify, and to pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to, any present or former director or officer or any individual who, while a director or officer and at our request, serves or has served another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise as a director, officer, partner, member, manager or trustee, from and against any claim or liability to which that person may become subject or which that person incurs by reason of his or her service in any such capacity and to pay or reimburse their reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding. 
 
 Our bylaws obligate us, to the maximum extent permitted by the MGCL and subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act, to indemnify any present or former director or officer or any individual who, while a director or officer and at our request, serves or has served another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise as a director, officer, partner, member, manager or trustee and who is made, or threatened to be made, a party to a proceeding by reason of his or her service in any such capacity from and against any claim or liability to which that person becomes subject or which that person incurs by reason of his or her service in any such capacity and, without requiring a preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification to pay or reimburse their reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding. Our charter and bylaws also permit us to indemnify and advance expenses to any person who served a predecessor of us in any of the capacities described above and any of our employees or agents or any employees or agents of our predecessor. In accordance with the 1940 Act, we will not indemnify any person for any liability to which such person would be subject by reason of such person s willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office. 
 
 3 

The MGCL requires a corporation (unless its charter provides otherwise, which our charter does not) to indemnify a director or officer who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of his or her service in that capacity. The MGCL permits a corporation to indemnify its present and former directors and officers, among others, against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them in connection with any proceeding to which they can be made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities unless it is established that (a) the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and (1) was committed in bad faith or (2) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (b) the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or (c) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. However, under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation cannot indemnify for an adverse judgment in a suit by or in the right of the corporation or for a judgment of liability on the basis that a personal benefit was improperly received unless, in either case, a court orders indemnification, and then only for expenses. In addition, the MGCL permits a corporation to advance reasonable expenses to a director or officer upon the corporation s receipt of (a) a written affirmation by the director or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the corporation and (b) a written undertaking by him or her or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the corporation if it is ultimately determined that the standard of conduct was not met. 
 
 Election of Directors 
 
 Our bylaws provide that the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast for or against a nominee for director at a duly called meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present is required to elect a director in an uncontested election. In a contested election, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which is a quorum is present. Under our bylaws, our board of directors is able to amend the bylaws to alter the vote required to elect directors. 
 
 Classified Board of Directors 
 
 Our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms, with the term of office of only one of the three classes expiring each year. At each annual meeting of stockholders, directors of the class of directors whose term expires at such meeting will be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders following the meeting at which they were elected and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. A classified board can render a change in control of us or removal of our incumbent management more difficult. We believe, however, that the longer time required to elect a majority of a classified board of directors helps to ensure the continuity and stability of our management and policies. 
 
 Number of Directors Removal Vacancies 
 
 Our charter and bylaws provide that the number of directors will be set only by the board of directors. Our bylaws provide that a majority of our entire board of directors can at any time increase or decrease the number of directors. However, unless our bylaws are amended, the number of directors can never be less than the minimum number required by the MGCL nor more than 12. We have elected to be subject to the provision of Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL regarding the filling of vacancies on the board of directors. Accordingly, except as provided by the board of directors in setting the terms of any class or series of preferred stock, any and all vacancies on the board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of the board of directors, can be filled only by vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum, and any director elected to fill a vacancy will serve for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is elected and qualifies, subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Our charter provides that a director can be removed only for cause, as defined in our charter, and then only by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors. The limitations on the ability of our stockholders to remove directors and fill vacancies could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or discourage a third-party from seeking to acquire, control of us. 
 
 4 

Action by Stockholders 
 
 Under the MGCL, stockholder action can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders or by unanimous written consent in lieu of a meeting (unless the charter provides for stockholder action by less than unanimous consent, which our charter does not). These provisions, combined with the requirements of our bylaws regarding the calling of a stockholder-requested meeting of stockholders discussed below, can have the effect of delaying consideration of a stockholder proposal until the next annual meeting. 
 
 Advance Notice Provisions for Stockholder Nominations and Stockholder Proposals 
 
 Our bylaws provide that with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders, nominations of persons for election to the board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered by stockholders can be made only (1) by or at the direction of the board of directors, (2) pursuant to our notice of meeting or (3) by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record at the time of provision of notice, at the record date and at the time of the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice procedures of the bylaws. With respect to special meetings of stockholders, only the business specified in our notice of the meeting can be brought before the meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors at a special meeting can be made only (1) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (2) provided that the special meeting has been called in accordance with our bylaws for the purposes of electing directors, by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record at the time of provision of notice, at the record date and at the time of the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice provisions of the bylaws. 
 
 The purpose of requiring stockholders to give us advance notice of nominations and other business is to afford our board of directors a meaningful opportunity to consider the qualifications of the proposed nominees and the advisability of any other proposed business and, to the extent deemed necessary or desirable by our board of directors, to inform stockholders and make recommendations about such qualifications or business, as well as to provide a more orderly procedure for conducting meetings of stockholders. Although our bylaws do not give our board of directors any power to disapprove stockholder nominations for the election of directors or proposals recommending certain action, they could have the effect of precluding a contest for the election of directors or the consideration of stockholder proposals if proper procedures are not followed and of discouraging or deterring a third party from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or to approve its own proposal without regard to whether consideration of such nominees or proposals might be harmful or beneficial to us and our stockholders. 
 
 Calling of Special Meetings of Stockholders 
 
 Our bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders can be called by our board of directors and certain of our officers. Additionally, our bylaws provide that, subject to the satisfaction of certain procedural and informational requirements by the stockholders requesting the meeting, a special meeting of stockholders will be called by the secretary of the corporation upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting. 
 
 Approval of Extraordinary Corporate Action Amendment of Charter and Bylaws 
 
 Under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, convert, transfer all or substantially all of its assets, engage in a share exchange, consolidate or engage in similar transactions outside the ordinary course of business, unless the action is declared advisable by the board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. However, a Maryland corporation can provide in its charter for approval of these matters by a lesser percentage, but not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Our charter provides for approval of these matters, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of shares entitled to vote on the matter. 
 
 5 

Our bylaws provide that the board of directors will have the exclusive power to adopt, alter or repeal any provision of our bylaws and to make new bylaws. 
 
 No Appraisal Rights 
 
 Except with respect to appraisal rights arising in connection with the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act discussed below, as permitted by the MGCL, our charter provides that stockholders will not be entitled to exercise appraisal rights. 
 
 Control Share Acquisitions 
 
 The Control Share Acquisition Act provides that control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Shares owned by the acquirer, by officers or by directors who are employees of the corporation are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter. Control shares are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power 
 
 one-tenth or more but less than one-third 
 
 one-third or more but less than a majority or 
 
 a majority or more of all voting power. 
 
 The requisite stockholder approval must be obtained each time an acquirer crosses one of the thresholds of voting power set forth above. Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A control share acquisition means the acquisition of control shares, subject to certain exceptions. 
 
 A person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition can compel the board of directors of the corporation to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50 days of demand to consider the voting rights of the shares. The right to compel the calling of a special meeting is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including an undertaking to pay the expenses of the meeting. If no request for a meeting is made, the corporation can itself present the question at any stockholders meeting. 
 
 If voting rights are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by the statute, then the corporation can repurchase for fair value any or all of the control shares, except those for which voting rights have previously been approved. The right of the corporation to repurchase control shares is subject to certain conditions and limitations, including, as provided in our bylaws, compliance with the 1940 Act. Fair value is determined, without regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquirer or of any meeting of stockholders at which the voting rights of the shares are considered and not approved. If voting rights for control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders can exercise appraisal rights. The fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of appraisal rights cannot be less than the highest price per share paid by the acquirer in the control share acquisition. 
 
 The Control Share Acquisition Act does not apply (a) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction or (b) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation. 
 
 6 

Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the Control Share Acquisition Act any and all acquisitions by any person of our shares of stock. There can be no assurance that such provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. 
 
 Business Combinations 
 
 Under the MGCL, business combinations between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. An interested stockholder is defined as 
 
 any person who, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of the corporation s shares or 
 
 an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was, directly or indirectly, the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting stock of the corporation. 
 
 A person is not an interested stockholder under this statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. However, in approving a transaction, the board of directors can provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board. 
 
 After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least 
 
 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation and 
 two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder. 
 
 These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation s common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under the MGCL, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. 
 
 The statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors before the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Our board of directors can adopt a resolution that any business combination between us and any other person is exempted from the provisions of the Business Combination Act, provided that the business combination is first approved by the board of directors, including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons as defined in the 1940 Act. This resolution, however, can be altered or repealed in whole or in part at any time. The Maryland Business Combination Act may discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer. 
 
 Conflict with 1940 Act 
 
 Our bylaws provide that, if and to the extent that any provision of the MGCL, including the Control Share Acquisition Act (if we amend our bylaws to be subject to such Act) and the Business Combination Act, or any 
 7 

provision of our charter or bylaws conflicts with any provision of the 1940 Act, the applicable provision of the 1940 Act will control.

(C) Independent Directors. 

Exhibit 14.1 

 Notwithstanding the reporting requirements set forth in this Section V, an Independent Director who would be required to make a report under this Section V solely by reason of being a director of the Corporation is not required to file a Personal Securities Holding Report upon becoming a director of the Corporation or annually thereafter.

 (G) Responsibility to Report. 
 Access Persons will be informed of their obligations to report, however, it is the responsibility of each Access Person to take the initiative to comply with the requirements of this Section V. Any effort by the Corporation, or by the Adviser and its affiliates, to facilitate the reporting process does not change or alter that responsibility. A person need not make a report hereunder with respect to transactions effected for, and Covered Securities held in, any account over which the person has no direct or indirect influence or control. 
 (H) Where to File Reports and Forms. 

Exhibit 14.1 

 (1) All Quarterly Securities Transaction Reports and Personal Securities Holdings Reports, as well as Private Company Securities and IPO Request and Reporting Forms, must be filed with the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 (2) The Chief Compliance Officer may, from time to time, adopt new methods to submit all Quarterly Securities Transaction Reports and Personal Securities Holdings Reports, as well as Private Company Securities and IPO Request and Reporting Forms.

 (I) Disclaimers. 
 Any report required by this Section V may contain a statement that the report will not be construed as an admission that the person making the report has any direct or indirect Beneficial Ownership in the Covered Security to which the report relates. 
 Section VI Additional Prohibitions 
 (A) Confidentiality of the Corporation s Transactions. 
 Until disclosed in a public report to stockholders or to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC in the normal course, all information concerning the securities being considered for purchase or sale by the Corporation shall be kept confidential by all Access Persons and disclosed by them only on a need to know basis. It shall be the responsibility of the Chief Compliance Officer to report any inadequacy found in this regard to the directors of the Corporation. 
 (B) Insider Trading. 
 (1) Clearance of Transactions. The Corporation requires that all purchases and sales of Corporation securities by Access Persons (and their respective immediate family members) be cleared by the Chief Compliance Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer s designee prior to placing any order related to such transactions. Currently, the only Corporation securities available for purchase is the common stock of Golub Capital BDC, Inc. traded on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol GBDC Shares ). 
 (2) Window Period. After receiving clearance from the Chief Compliance Officer of the Corporation, Access Persons may purchase or sell Shares only during a designated window period. Should the end of the window period fall on a weekend, such window will be extended through close of business on the following business day. Significantly, however, even during a window period, Access Persons may not engage in transactions involving Shares if such person is in possession of material, nonpublic information on the trade date. 
 (3) Avoidance of Speculative Transactions. Certain types of transactions as well as the timing of trading may raise an inference of the improper use of inside information. In order to avoid 

Exhibit 14.1 

 even the appearance of impropriety, the Corporation discourages trades by Access Persons that are of a short-term, speculative nature rather than for investment purposes. 
 (4) Limited Disclosure. Access Persons who have access to material information regarding the Corporation or its operations should exercise the utmost caution in preserving the confidentiality of that information. If anyone becomes aware of a leak of material information, whether inadvertent or otherwise, such person should report such leak immediately to the Chief Compliance Officer. Any insider who leaks inside information to a tippee may be equally liable with the tippee to third parties for any profit of the tippee. Of course, it will be necessary from time to time, for legitimate business reasons, to disclose material information to persons outside of the Corporation. Such persons might include commercial bankers, investment bankers or other companies with whom the Corporation may be pursuing a joint project. In such situations, material nonpublic information should not be conveyed until an express understanding, typically in the form of the Corporation s standard nondisclosure agreement, or NDA, has been reached that such information may not be used for trading purposes and may not be further disclosed other than for legitimate business reasons. Please contact the Chief Compliance Officer before disclosing any material non-public information regarding the Corporation to a third party or entering into an NDA.

 Section VIII Sanctions 
 Any violation of this Code shall be subject to the imposition of such sanctions by the 17j-1 Organization as may be deemed appropriate under the circumstances to achieve the purposes of Rule 17j-1 and this Code. The sanctions to be imposed shall be determined by the board of directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors, provided, however, that with respect to violations by persons who are directors, managers, partners, officers or employees of the Adviser (or of a company that controls 

Exhibit 14.1 

 the Adviser), the sanctions to be imposed shall be determined by the Adviser (or the controlling person thereof). Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, suspension or termination of employment, a letter of censure and or restitution of an amount equal to the difference between the price paid or received by the Corporation and the more advantageous price paid or received by the offending person.

 Employees do not have an indirect pecuniary interest in securities held by entities in which they hold an equity interest unless they are a controlling equity holder or they share investment control over the securities held by the entity. 
 The following circumstances constitute beneficial ownership by employees of securities held by a trust 
 Legal ownership of securities as a trustee by an employee or members of the employees immediate family 
 Ownership of a vested beneficial interest in a trust by an employee or members of the employees immediate family and 
 An employee s status as a settlor of a trust, unless the consent of all of the beneficiaries is required in order for the employee to revoke the trust. 
 Restricted Securities 
 Anytime an employee receives material non-public information (as described in Part II, below) about a company that has issued publicly traded securities (a Public Company ), that company will be added to the Adviser s Restricted Securities List. Employees will be responsible for contacting the compliance golubcapital.com any time that they receive or intend to receive any non-public information about a Public Company. 
 A copy of all executed confidentiality agreements concerning a Public Company must be brought to the attention of the Chief Compliance Officer. Once an authorized signatory for the Adviser has signed a confidentiality agreement for the purpose of receiving non-public information about a Public Company, the company may be placed on the Restricted Securities List if the non-public information received about the Public Company is material. 
 Employees are responsible for notifying the Chief Compliance Officer of any other circumstances in which they or the firm should be restricted pursuant to this Code of Ethics. 
 Employees may not trade securities in a Public Company on the Restricted Securities List, including but not limited to, trading in an Employee s personal account or on behalf of a 

Exhibit 14.2 

 Client account without receiving pre-clearance from the Compliance Department. Investment professionals should consider the fact that they will be restricted from trading the public securities of a Public Company for which any employee has received non-public information when evaluating any potential hedging strategies for positions. Employees may be unable to liquidate personal or Client holdings of securities that are subsequently added to the Restricted Securities List. 
 Unless the Chief Compliance sets up ethical walls, all employees, whether investment professionals or non-investment professionals, will be regarded as having access to any non-public information about a Public Company that has been received by any other employee. 
 The Chief Compliance Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer s designee will periodically review each Public Company on the Restricted Securities List to determine whether any employees remain in possession of non-public information. Additionally, a Public Company can be removed from the Restricted List by the Chief Compliance Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer s designee at other times if it can be determined that no employee remains in possession of non-public information, and no employee has any intention of obtaining such information. 
 Investments in Private Company Securities and Initial Public Offerings 
 Employees may not acquire, directly or indirectly, any Beneficial Ownership in any limited offering or initial public offering IPO without first obtaining prior approval of the Chief Compliance Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer s designee in order to preclude any possibility of the employee profiting improperly from such employee s position with the Adviser. The Chief Compliance Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer s designee shall (1) obtain from the employee full details of the proposed transaction (including written certification that the investment opportunity did not arise by virtue of the employee s activities on behalf of a Client) and (2) conclude, after consultation with a portfolio manager (who has no personal interest in the issuer of the limited offering or IPO), that no Clients have any foreseeable interest in purchasing such security. A record of such approval and the reasons supporting those decisions shall be kept as required in the Records section of this Policy. 
 Reporting 
 In order to provide the Adviser with information to enable it to determine with reasonable assurance any indications of front-running or the appearance of a conflict of interest with the trading by any Client account, each Adviser employee must submit a report to the Chief Compliance Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer s designee showing all transactions in which the person has, or by reason of such transaction acquires, any direct or indirect Beneficial Ownership except for exempt transactions listed in the section below entitled Exemptions from Reporting Requirements. 

Exhibit 14.2 

 Transaction Reports 
 Employees are required to (i) instruct their broker-dealers to send to the Adviser duplicate broker-dealer trade confirmations and account statements which must be received by the Chief Compliance Officer, at a minimum, no later than thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter and or (ii) complete such paperwork as is required by the Chief Compliance Officer so that such information may be provided electronically to the firm. If an employee s trades do not occur through a broker-dealer (e.g., purchase of a private investment fund), such transactions shall be reported separately on the quarterly personal securities transaction report. The quarterly transaction reports shall contain at least the following information for each transaction in a Reportable Security in which the employee had, or as a result of the transaction acquired, any direct or indirect beneficial ownership (a) the date of the transaction, the title, and as applicable the exchange ticker symbol or CUSIP number, the interest rate and maturity date (if applicable), the number of shares and the principal amount of each Reportable Security involved (b) the nature of the transaction (e.g., purchase, sale or any other type of acquisition or disposition) (c) the price of the Reportable Security at which the transaction was effected (d) the name of the broker, dealer or bank with or through which the transaction was effected and (e) the date that the report is submitted. Employees are reminded that they must also report transactions by members of the employee s immediate family including spouse, children and other members of the household in accounts over which the employee has direct or indirect influence or control. If an employee has arranged to have monthly brokerage statements delivered to the Chief Compliance Officer, directly or electronically, then quarterly transaction reports are not required. 
 Initial and Annual Holdings Reports 
 New Adviser employees will be required to report all of their personal securities holdings not later than 10 days after the commencement of their employment. The initial holdings report must be current as of a date not more than 45 days prior to the date the person becomes an employee. 
 Existing employees are required to certify to the Adviser on an annual basis that the Adviser has a complete list of the Adviser s holdings. 
 Each holdings report (both the initial and annual) must contain, at a minimum (a) the title and type of security, and as applicable the exchange ticker symbol or CUSIP number, number of shares, and principal amount of each reportable security in which the employee has any direct or indirect beneficial ownership (b) the name of any broker, dealer or bank with which the employee maintains an account in which any securities are held for the employee s direct or indirect benefit and (c) the date the employee submits the report. 
 Duplicate Copies 
 In order to help ensure that duplicate brokerage confirmations are received for all accounts pertaining to a particular employee, such employee must complete and send a brokerage letter to each bank, broker or dealer maintaining an account on behalf of the employee if requested by the Chief Compliance Officer. 

Exhibit 14.2 

 Exceptions from Reporting Requirement 
 Employees are not required to submit (1) a transaction or initial and annual holdings report with respect to securities held in accounts over which the access person had no direct or indirect influence or control, or (2) a transaction report with respect to transactions effected pursuant to an automatic investment plan. 
 New Account Report 
 A report shall be completed by an employee, when applicable, to disclose the name of any new account established by the employee during the quarter in which any securities, including Permitted Securities, were held for the direct or indirect benefit of the employee and include (a) the name of the broker, dealer or bank with whom the employee established the account (b) the date the account was established and (c) the date that the report is submitted by the employee. 
 Review 
 The Adviser strictly forbids front-running Client accounts, which is a practice generally understood to be employees personally trading ahead of Client accounts. The Chief Compliance Officer will closely monitor employees investment patterns to detect these abuses. The Adviser s members will monitor the Chief Compliance Officer s personal securities transactions for compliance with the Personal Securities Transaction Policy. 
 The reason for the development of a post-transaction review process is to ensure that the Adviser has developed procedures to supervise the activities of its access persons. The comparison of employee trades to those of Clients will identify potential conflicts of interest or the appearance of a potential conflict. 
 If the Adviser discovers that an employee is personally trading contrary to the policies set forth above, the employee shall meet with the Chief Compliance Officer and the Adviser s members to review the facts surrounding the transactions. This meeting shall help the Adviser to determine the appropriate course of action. 
 Remedial Actions 
 The Adviser takes the potential for conflicts of interest caused by personal investing very seriously. Employees should be aware that the Adviser reserves the right to impose varied sanctions on policy violators depending on the severity of the policy violation, including termination of employment. 
 II. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO DETECT AND PREVENT INSIDER TRADING 
 The Adviser s business may require employees to deal with confidential information. The proper handling of material, non-public information is critical to the Adviser s integrity. The Adviser s reputation is a vital asset and even the appearance of the misuse of material, non-public information should be avoided. The misuse of non-public information may violate federal 

Exhibit 14.2 

 and state securities laws and other legal and regulatory requirements. Violations may be damaging to both the reputation and financial position of the Adviser and its employees. 
 The Adviser forbids trading, either for oneself or for others, on material, non-public information or communicating material, non-public information to others in violation of the law. This conduct is frequently called insider trading. The Adviser s policy extends to activities within and outside one s relationship with the Adviser. Individuals who cease to work for the Adviser must continue to maintain the confidentiality of inside and proprietary information learned during their employment. 
 Although insider trading is not defined in securities laws, it is generally thought to be described as trading either personally or on behalf of others on the basis of material non-public information or communicating material non-public information to others in violation of the law. 
 In the past, securities laws have been interpreted to prohibit the following activities 
 Trading by an insider while in possession of material non-public information 
 Trading by a non-insider while in possession of material non-public information, where the information was disclosed to the non-insider in violation of an insider s duty to keep it confidential or 
 Communicating material non-public information to others in breach of a fiduciary duty. 
 Whom Does the Policy Cover 
 This policy covers all of the Adviser s employees covered persons as well as any transactions in any securities participated in by family members, trusts or corporations directly or indirectly controlled by such persons. In addition, the policy applies to transactions engaged in by corporations in which the covered person is an officer, director or 10 or greater stockholder and a partnership of which the covered person is a partner unless the covered person has no direct or indirect control over the partnership. If any employee has questions about whom this policy covers, such employee should consult the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 What Information is Material 
 Information is material when there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making investment decisions. Generally, this is information whose disclosure will have a substantial effect on the price of a company s securities. No simple bright line test exists to determine whether information is material assessments of materiality involve highly fact specific inquiries. Adviser employees should direct any questions regarding the materiality of information to the Chief Compliance Officer. The following is an illustrative list of the type of information that is generally regarded as material 
 Information relating to a company s results and operations 
 Dividend or earnings announcements 

Exhibit 14.2 

 Write-downs or write-offs of assets 
 Additions to reserves for bad debts or contingent liabilities 
 Expansion or curtailment of company or major division operations 
 Merger, joint venture announcements 
 New product service announcements 
 Discovery or research developments 
 Criminal, civil and government investigations and indictments 
 Pending labor disputes 
 Debt service or liquidity problems 
 Bankruptcy or insolvency problems 
 Tender offers, stock repurchase plans, etc. 
 Recapitalization 
 Information provided by a company could be material because of its expected effect on a particular class of a company s securities, all of the company s securities, the securities of another company, or the securities of several companies. The misuse of material non-public information applies to all types of securities, including equity, debt, commercial paper, government securities and options. 
 Material information does not have to relate to a company s business. For example, material information about the contents of an upcoming newspaper column may affect the price of a security and therefore be considered material. Material information may also relate to the market for a security. Information about a significant order to purchase or sell securities, in some contexts, may be deemed material similarly, prepublication information regarding reports in the financial press may also be deemed material. 
 What Information is Non-Public 
 In order for issues concerning insider trading to arise, information must not only be material, but also non-public. Non-public information generally means information that has not been available to the investing public. 
 Once material, non-public information has been effectively distributed to the investing public, it is no longer classified as material, non-public information. However, the distribution of non-public information must occur through commonly recognized channels for the classification to change. In addition, the information must not only be publicly disclosed, there 

Exhibit 14.2 

 must be adequate time for the public to receive and digest the information. Lastly, non-public information does not change to public information solely by selective dissemination. 
 The Adviser s employees must be aware that even where there is no expectation of confidentiality, a person may become an insider upon receiving material, non-public information. Whether the tip made to the employee makes such employee a tippee depends on whether the corporate insider expects to benefit personally, either directly or indirectly, from the disclosure. 
 The benefit is not limited to a present or future monetary gain it could be a reputational benefit or an expectation of a quid pro quo from the recipient by a gift of the information. Employees may also become insiders or tippees if they obtain material, non-public information by happenstance, at social gatherings, by overhearing conversations, etc. 
 Penalties for Trading on Insider Information 
 Severe penalties exist for firms and individuals that engage in the act of insider trading, including civil injunctions, treble damages, disgorgement of profits and jail sentences. Further, fines for individuals and firms found guilty of insider trading are levied in amounts up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided, and up to the greater of 1,000,000 or three times the profit gained or loss avoided, respectively. 

Exhibit 14.2 

 Procedures to Follow if an Employee Believes That Such Employee Possesses Material, Non-Public Information 
 The Adviser has established the following procedures to help each employee avoid insider trading and to aid the Adviser in preventing, detecting and imposing sanctions against insider trading. Each employee must follow these procedures or risk serious sanctions, including dismissal, substantial personal liability and criminal penalties. If any employee has questions about these procedures, such employee should consult the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 If an employee has questions as to whether such employee is in possession of material, non-public information, the employee must inform the Chief Compliance Officer as soon as possible. From this point, the employee, the Chief Compliance Officer and the Adviser s members will conduct research to determine if the information is likely to be considered important to investors in making investment decisions and whether the information has been publicly disseminated. 
 Given the severe penalties imposed on individuals and firms engaging in insider trading, an Adviser employee 
 shall not trade the securities of any company in which such employee is deemed an insider who may possess material, non-public information about the company 
 shall not trade the securities of any company except in accordance with the Adviser s Personal Securities Transaction Policy and the securities laws 
 shall submit personal security trading reports in accordance with the Personal Security Transaction Policy 
 shall not discuss any potentially material, non-public information with colleagues, except as specifically required by such employee s position 
 shall immediately report the potential receipt of non-public information to the Chief Compliance Officer and the Adviser s members and 
 shall not proceed with any research, trading or other investment advisory activities until the Chief Compliance Officer and the Adviser s members inform the employee of the appropriate course of action. 
 III. DIRECTORSHIPS OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES 
 Serving as Officers, Trustees and or Directors of Outside Organizations 
 Employees may, under certain circumstances, be granted permission to serve as directors, trustees or officers of outside organizations. These organizations can include public or private corporations, partnerships, charitable foundations and other not-for-profit institutions. Employees may also receive compensation for such activities. 

Exhibit 14.2 

 At certain times, the Adviser may determine that it is in its Clients best interests for an employee to serve as an officer or on the board of directors of outside organizations. For example, a company held in Clients portfolios may be undergoing a reorganization that may affect the value of the company s outstanding securities and the future direction of the company. Service with organizations outside of the Adviser can, however, raise serious regulatory issues and concerns, including conflicts of interests and access to material non-public information. 
 As an outside board member or officer, an employee may come into possession of material non-public information about the outside company or other public companies. It is critical that a proper information barrier be in place between the Adviser and the outside organization and that the employee not communicate such information to other Adviser employees in violation of the information barrier. 
 Similarly, the Adviser may have a business relationship with the outside organization or may seek a relationship in the future. In those circumstances, the employee should not be involved in the decision to retain or hire the Adviser. 
 Adviser employees are prohibited from engaging in such outside activities without the prior written approval from the Chief Compliance Officer. Approval will be granted on a case-by-case basis, subject to proper resolution of potential conflicts of interest. Outside activities will be approved only if any conflict of interest issues can be satisfactorily resolved. 
 Outside Business Activities 
 Adviser personnel generally may not be employed (either on a part-time, evening or weekend basis) or compensated by any business other than the Adviser or one of its affiliates. 
 Approval of the Chief Compliance Officer for any of the above activities must be obtained prior to engaging in such activity so that determinations may be made regarding (1) the degree to which such activity may interfere with the employee s duties to the Adviser and the Clients and (2) whether such activity involves conflicts of interest between the Adviser and any Client that need to be disclosed and may require Client and or Fund Investor consent. 
 IV. RUMORS MANIPULATIVE TRADING PRACTICES 
 A. Rumors 
 Supervised Persons are prohibited from circulating false rumors and rumors of a sensational character that reasonably may be expected to affect market conditions for one or more securities, sectors or markets, or improperly influencing any person or entity. Intentionally creating, passing or using false rumors may violate the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws, and such conduct is contradictory to this Code of Ethics and the Adviser s expectations regarding appropriate behavior of its Supervised Persons. 
 A Supervised Person should consult with the Chief Compliance Officer if such Supervised Person has questions regarding the appropriateness of any communications. 

Exhibit 14.2 

 B. Manipulative Trading Practices 
 Section 9(a)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder make it unlawful for any person, acting alone or with others, to trade any security in order to create actual or apparent active trading in such security, or raise or depress the price of the security. 
 Supervised Persons are prohibited from engaging in actual or apparent trading in a security for the purpose of (a) inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others or (b) causing the price of a security to move up or down. The Exchange Act does not prohibit otherwise lawful activity that has the incidental result of changing the supply or demand or the intrinsic value of a security. 
 V. POLITICAL CONTRIBUTION POLICY 
 Pay-to-play is the practice of making campaign contributions and related payments to elected officials in order to influence the awarding of lucrative contracts for the management of public pension plan assets and similar government investment accounts. The SEC has adopted measures to curtail pay-to-play practices by registered investment advisers. The Adviser prohibits any Supervised Person from making a political contribution to gain, or to attempt to gain, an engagement for the Adviser or any affiliate. 
 The Adviser also prohibits any Supervised Person from making any political contributions without prior written approval as outlined in the policy statement below 
 This policy statement is necessary to comply with laws, regulations and governmental policies relating to political contributions to public officials and candidates by investment managers, their employees and certain related parties described below, or relating to their solicitation or coordination of political contributions. For this purpose, a political contribution includes any gift, loan, deposit, transition or inaugural expense, or anything of value other than unpaid volunteer time, or any indirect contributions directed, funded or solicited through third parties. 
 This policy statement covers any owner, director, officer, employee or agent of Golub Capital, any of their household members, or any political action committee or other entity that they control. It prohibits any such person or entity covered by this policy statement from making a contribution to anyone who is, or who is campaigning to become, a state, local or public retirement plan official, without first notifying Golub Capital and receiving prior approval from Compliance. A candidate for federal office that is currently a state, local or retirement plan official would be subject to this restriction. Prior notice and approval are also required prior to the solicitation or coordination of political contributions for anyone who is, or who is campaigning to become, a state, local or public retirement plan official, or for state or local political parties. 
 The purpose of this policy statement is not to unnecessarily limit political contributions and activities, but to comply with applicable laws, regulations and 

Exhibit 14.2 

 governmental policies applicable to Golub Capital, including changes that might occur in the law. Therefore, Golub Capital will normally approve political contributions and activities that comply with applicable laws, regulations and governmental policies, do not impose a material risk to Golub Capital in light of possible changes that might occur and do not otherwise impose a material risk to the business or reputation of Golub Capital. For example, under current rules, Golub Capital will normally approve contributions outside the State of New York by persons who are not in management or fundraising roles or who make contributions under certain dollar thresholds. Golub Capital also will normally approve contributions in the State of New York under certain dollar thresholds by persons entitled to vote for the office involved. Similarly, Golub Capital will normally approve contributions involving governmental offices that are not involved in the management of assets or the selection of investment managers, and that are not in a position to appoint or otherwise influence such officials. In all events, however, Golub Capital may be required to keep records of contributions and solicitation and coordination activities of persons and entities covered by this policy statement, and to disclose those records to its governmental regulators. 
 This policy statement may change as laws, regulations and governmental policies change. This policy statement is in addition to, and does not replace, other policies of Golub Capital with respect to complying with laws and maintaining the highest level of integrity concerning Golub Capital s dealings with its Investors, including but not limited to Investors that represent state, municipal and retirement plan assets. 
 VI. PROVIDING INVESTMENT ADVICE TO PERSONS OTHER THAN ADVISER CLIENTS DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INTEREST IN TRANSACTIONS 
 To avoid conflicts with the interests of Clients, no Supervised Person may provide investment advice (e.g., advice as to the value of securities, or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling securities) or portfolio management services for compensation to any person, other than a Client, under any circumstances, unless that arrangement is disclosed to and approved by the Chief Compliance Officer. Such investment advice would be considered an outside business activity and should be reported as such. It is a conflict of interest to recommend any security to a Client, or to direct any transaction for a Client in that security, if a Supervised Person has a personal interest in that security. Therefore, if a Supervised Person has a personal interest in a security (other than an interest in a Fund), such Supervised Person must disclose that interest to the Chief Compliance Officer before recommending that security or before directing an investment decision with respect to that security. If a Supervised Person has the power to direct any transaction in any such security, investment personnel with no personal interest in such security must review such an investment decision. A personal interest in a security may be financial, but it may also involve another interest, such as a family or friend s involvement with a security. This shall not, however, prohibit a Supervised Person from making investment decisions for such Supervised Person s own account, subject to the Code of Ethics. 

Exhibit 14.2 

 VII. GIFTS 
 Receiving Excessive Gifts or Entertainment is Prohibited 
 Receiving excessive gifts or entertainment from others who may represent actual or potential vendors is prohibited. Supervised Persons may accept only business-related meals, entertainment, gifts, or favors when the value involved is not significant and clearly will not create any appearance of a conflict of interest or an obligation to the donor. The value of a gift or favor should be less than 100 and may not be part of a recurrent pattern of giving. Each Supervised Person may accept gifts from a single giver (any firm or natural person associated with such firm) in amounts not exceeding 100 in any year. Such prohibition does not limit ordinary and usual business entertainment provided by a firm or its associates to Supervised Persons. Thus, when a firm or its associates are hosting Supervised Persons at an occasional meal, sporting event, theater production or comparable entertainment event, such an event would not be subject to the 100 gift restriction so long as it is neither so frequent nor so extensive as to raise any question of propriety. 
 Approval Required for Receipt of Gifts in Excess of 100 
 Before accepting anything with an assumed individual or aggregate value (except for those items of business entertainment noted directly above) from any outside business person in excess of 100 during any year, a Supervised Person must obtain the written approval of the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 Providing Excessive Gifts or Entertainment is Prohibited 
 Providing excessive gifts or entertainment to others who may represent actual or prospective clients is also prohibited. Giving extravagant gifts or entertainment to the fiduciary of an account can be construed as an inducement to such fiduciary to allocate client assets on a basis other than the suitability of the manager. Further, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA and many state laws (with respect to state plans) prohibit such gifts. 
 In any case, no gifts or entertainment of any value should be given with respect to any ERISA or Taft-Hartley benefit plan investor, state or municipal pension plans or state or local elected officials without prior approval of the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 Supervised Persons may give only business-related meals, entertainment, gifts or favors when the value involved is not significant and clearly will not create any appearance of a conflict of interest or an obligation to the donor. The value of a gift or favor should be less than 250 and may not be part of a recurrent pattern of giving. Each Supervised Person may give gifts to a single receiver (any firm or natural person associated with such firm) in amounts not exceeding 250 in any year. Such prohibition does not limit ordinary and usual business entertainment provided to a firm or its associates. Thus, when a firm or its associates are hosted by Supervised Persons at an occasional meal, sporting event, theater production or comparable entertainment 

Exhibit 14.2 

 event, such an event would not be subject to the 250 gift restriction so long as it is neither so frequent nor so extensive as to raise any question of propriety. 
 Approval Required for Providing Gifts in Excess of 250 
 Before giving anything with an assumed individual or aggregate value (except for those items of business entertainment noted directly above) to any outside business person in excess of 250 during any year, a Supervised Person must obtain the approval of the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 Under no circumstances may an employee initiate or encourage the provision of a gift from any other person or organization. For the avoidance of doubt, this policy regarding gifts also applies to interactions with government entities and employees. 
 Relationships with Outside Vendors 
 Supervised Persons should be careful when doing business on behalf of the Adviser with outside vendors Vendors with which a Supervised Person has a financial interest or family or personal relationship. These situations may present conflicts of interest that impair the Supervised Person from acting solely in the best interests of the Adviser and its Clients and without regard to the financial interest or family or personal relationship. When a Supervised Person learns that the Adviser is, or is considering, doing business with a Vendor with which that or another employee has a financial, family or personal relationship, the Supervised Person should disclose that information promptly to the Chief Compliance Officer. While there is no absolute prohibition against holding a financial interest in or having a family or personal relationship with a Vendor, the Adviser will examine these situations, before the relationship with the Adviser begins to the extent practicable, so that the Adviser can evaluate any potential conflicts of interest. 
 In evaluating these situations, a conflict of interest will be presumed to exist when an employee who has a financial, family or personal relationship with a Vendor approves the use of the Vendor or negotiates the terms of the agreement with the Vendor. Certain mitigating facts can overcome this presumption. Factors that will be considered include the significance of the financial interest, the degree of the family or personal relationship and whether the fairness of the price of the goods or services can be determined independently. 
 VIII. DISCLOSURE OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
 Any Supervised Person who becomes aware of any practice that arguably involves the Adviser in a conflict of interest and is not sure whether the practice has been fully and accurately disclosed to Clients and or Investors or whether Clients and or Investors have consented to the practice should promptly contact the Chief Compliance Officer. In assisting the Chief Compliance Officer in formulating appropriate disclosures, Supervised Persons must bear in mind that the Adviser will not be deemed to have properly obtained consent from a particular Client or Investor unless the disclosure relating to the conflict is materially accurate and complete and understandable by that particular Client or Investor.
