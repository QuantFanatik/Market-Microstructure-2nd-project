 our ability to expand existing market penetration and enter into new markets;

 SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS 
 
 We are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including industry and operating risks, financial and economic risks, legal and regulatory risks, risks related to our relationship with Post, risks related to ownership of our Common Stock and certain general risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. Risks that we deem material are described in Item 1A, Risk Factors of this report. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 A substantial amount of our net sales comes from our RTD protein shakes, and a decrease in sales of our RTD protein shakes would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We operate in a category with strong competition. 
 Disruption of our supply chain and changes in weather conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We are currently dependent on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for the manufacturing of most of our products, including one manufacturer for the majority of our RTD protein shakes. Our business could suffer if we do not continue to contract with key third-party manufacturers or as a result of a third-party contract manufacturer s inability to produce our products for us in the quantities required, on time or to our specifications. 
 Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers for certain equipment, ingredients and packaging materials, the price and availability of ingredients and packaging materials, higher freight costs and higher energy costs could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We must identify changing consumer and customer preferences and behaviors and develop and offer products to meet these preferences. 
 Our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain favorable perceptions of our brands. 
 Uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, including during periods of high inflation, could limit consumer and customer demand for our products, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect us. 
 Consolidation in our distribution channels, and competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, may hurt our profit margins. 
 Our sales and profit growth are dependent upon our ability to expand existing market penetration and enter into new markets. 
 Loss of, a significant reduction of purchases by or bankruptcy of a major customer may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Violations of laws or regulations by us or our third-party contract manufacturers, as well as new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations, could adversely affect our business. 
 Fluctuations in our business due to changes in our promotional activities and seasonality may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We have substantial debt, which could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position and could adversely affect our business. 
 Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets could be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings. 
 U.S. and global capital and credit market issues, including those that have arisen as a result of heightened inflation, could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers. 
 We have overlapping directors and management with Post, which may lead to conflicting interests or the appearance of conflicting interests. 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Delaware law may discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of us, even if such transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. 
 We may be unable to take certain actions because such actions could jeopardize the tax-free status of the Spin-off, and such restrictions could be significant. 
 We may be responsible for U.S. federal tax liabilities that relate to the Spin-off. 
 3 

Table of Contents 

 If all or a portion of the Spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction for any reason, including because any of the factual statements or representations in the legal opinions are incomplete or untrue, Post may recognize a substantial gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and we may incur indemnification or other liabilities to Post as a result. 
 Pending and future litigation and claims may impair our reputation or lead us to incur significant costs. 
 Our international operations subject us to additional risks. 
 Our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them, or termination of our material intellectual property licenses, could reduce the value of our products and brands and have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Technology failures, cybersecurity incidents and corruption of our data privacy protections could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business. 
 Impairment in the carrying value of intangible assets could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we will be required to record impairment charges, which may be significant. 
 If we pursue acquisitions or other strategic transactions, we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses. 
 Actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance and our forward-looking statements. 
 We may not be able to operate successfully if we are unable to recruit, hire, retain and develop key personnel and a qualified and diverse workforce. In addition, temporary workforce disruptions or the inability of our employees to safely perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of illness could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 General 
 BellRing Brands, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Distribution, LLC) BellRing was formed in the State of Delaware on October 20, 2021 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Post Holdings, Inc. Post for the purpose of effecting the separation of BellRing Intermediate Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Brands, Inc.) Old BellRing from Post. Under a transaction agreement and plan of merger (the Transaction Agreement that we entered into on October 26, 2021 and amended as of February 28, 2022, with Post, Old BellRing and our subsidiary BellRing Merger Sub Corporation Merger Sub ), Post distributed approximately 80.1 of its interest in us to Post s shareholders and Merger Sub merged with and into Old BellRing, with Old BellRing surviving and becoming our subsidiary. On March 10, 2022, as a result of the completion of the transactions provided for under the Transaction Agreement (including the Separation and Distribution , each defined below), we became a new public holding company and the successor registrant to Old BellRing. In this report, we refer to the transactions undertaken pursuant to the Transaction Agreement as the Spin-off. The Spin-off is described in more detail below. 
 Our Company 
 We are a leader in the global convenient nutrition category, aiming to enhance the lives of our consumers by providing them with nutritious, great-tasting products they can enjoy throughout the day. Our primary brands, Premier Protein and Dymatize , target a broad range of consumers and compete in all major product forms, including ready-to-drink RTD protein shakes, other RTD beverages and powders. Our products are distributed across a diverse network of channels including club, food, drug and mass FDM ), eCommerce, specialty and convenience. 
 We have organically grown our net sales from million in our year ended September 30, 2021 to million in our year ended September 30, 2023. Over the same period, net earnings including redeemable noncontrolling interest increased from 114.4 million in our year ended September 30, 2021 to 165.5 million in our year ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Spin-off 
 Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement and in connection with a series of corporate separation transactions, on March 9, 2022, Post contributed to us (i) all of its nonvoting common units of BellRing Brands, LLC BellRing LLC and its sole outstanding share of Old BellRing s Class B common stock, 0.01 par value per share (the Old BellRing Class B Common Stock and with Old BellRing s Class A common stock, 0.01 par value per share (the Old BellRing Class A Common Stock), collectively, the Old BellRing Common Stock )) and (ii) 550.4 million in cash, in exchange for Post s right to receive 840.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.00 Senior Notes due 2030 and limited liability company interests in us (prior to our conversion to a Delaware corporation, as described below). 
 On March 10, 2022, we converted into a Delaware corporation and changed our name to BellRing Brands, Inc. , and Post distributed an aggregate of 78.1 million, or 80.1 , of its shares of our common stock, 0.01 par value per share (the BellRing Common Stock to its shareholders in a pro-rata distribution (the Distribution ). Post shareholders received 1.267788 shares of BellRing Common Stock for every one share of Post common stock held as of the record date for the Distribution. No fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock were issued, and instead, cash in lieu of any fractional shares was paid to Post shareholders. 
 Also on March 10, 2022, upon completion of the Distribution, Merger Sub merged with and into Old BellRing (the Merger ), with Old BellRing continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary. Under the Merger, each outstanding share of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock was converted into one share of BellRing Common Stock and 2.97 in cash, resulting in 115.5 million in total consideration paid t o Old BellRing Class A common stockholders pursuant to the Merger . 
 As a result of the Spin-off, we became the new public parent company of, and successor issuer to, Old BellRing, and shares of our BellRing Common Stock were deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated thereunder. 
 Immediately following the Spin-off, Post owned approximately 14.2 of BellRing Common Stock and the former holders of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock owned approximately 28.5 of BellRing Common Stock. As a result of the Spin-off, the dual class voting structure of Old BellRing was eliminated. As of September 30, 2023, Post had no ownership of BellRing Common Stock. 
 Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to BellRing, we, our, us, the Company and our Company refer to (1) Old BellRing and its consolidated subsidiaries during the periods prior to the

 completion of the Spin-off, including BellRing LLC, Premier Nutrition Company, LLC Premier Nutrition ), Dymatize Enterprises, LLC Dymatize ), Supreme Protein, LLC Supreme Protein), the PowerBar brand and Active Nutrition International GmbH Active Nutrition International and (2) us and our consolidated subsidiaries during the periods subsequent to the Spin-off, including, BellRing LLC, Premier Nutrition, Dymatize, Supreme Protein, Active Nutrition International and Premier Nutrition Canada, Inc., in each case, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates. 
 Our History prior to the Spin-off 
 Prior to completion of the Spin-off, and subsequent to Old BellRing s initial public offering (the Old BellRing IPO ), which was completed in October 2019, our subsidiary BellRing LLC was the holder of Post s active nutrition business, which had been comprised of Premier Nutrition, Dymatize, the PowerBar brand and Active Nutrition International. The members of BellRing LLC were Post and Old BellRing. Old BellRing held the voting membership unit of BellRing LLC (which represented the power to appoint and remove the members of the board of managers of BellRing LLC and no economic interest). Post held one share of the Old BellRing Class B Common Stock, which represented 67 of the voting power of the common stock of Old BellRing, with the holders of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock holding 33 of the voting power. Immediately prior to completion of the Spin-off, Post owned of the economic interests in BellRing LLC, and Old BellRing (and, indirectly, the holders of the Old BellRing Class A Common Stock) owned 28.5 of the economic interests in BellRing LLC. Old BellRing, as a holding company, had no material assets other than its ownership of BellRing LLC units and its indirect interests in the subsidiaries of BellRing LLC. 
 Post had acquired the businesses that comprised its active nutrition business in a series of transactions during 2013, 2014 and 2015. In its fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, Post acquired Premier Nutrition Corporation, which, at the time, was a marketer and distributor of high-quality protein shakes and nutrition bars under the Premier Protein brand and nutritional supplements under the Joint Juice brand. Effective September 30, 2019, Premier Nutrition Corporation converted to a limited liability company and changed its corporate name to Premier Nutrition Company, LLC. 
 In its fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, Post acquired Dymatize, which, at the time, was a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality protein powders and nutritional supplements under the Dymatize brand and nutrition bars under the Supreme Protein brand. 
 In its fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, Post acquired the PowerBar brand and Active Nutrition International (then known as Powerbar Europe GmbH). The PowerBar brand was founded in 1986. 
 Our Organizational Structure 
 As a result of the Spin-off: 
 We became the new public parent company of, and successor issuer to, Old BellRing, and shares of our BellRing Common Stock were deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated thereunder. 
 Old BellRing is our wholly-owned subsidiary. 
 All of our membership interests in BellRing LLC were contributed to Old BellRing and Old BellRing is the sole equity member of BellRing LLC. 
 Immediately following the Spin-off, Post owned 19,397,339 shares, or approximately 14.2 , of BellRing Common Stock. On August 11, 2022, Post disposed of 14,800,000 shares of BellRing Common Stock, which resulted in Post owning 4,597,339 shares, or approximately 3.4 , of BellRing Common Stock as of September 30, 2022. On November 25, 2022, Post disposed of its remaining shares of BellRing Common Stock, which resulted in Post having no ownership of BellRing Common Stock as of September 30, 2023. 
 See Risk Factors included in Item 1A of this report and Notes 1 and 13 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for more information about the Spin-off. 
 Our Industry 
 We operate in the global convenient nutrition category, a rapidly-growing and on-trend category within the food and beverage industry. The U.S. is our primary market and is the largest and most developed market in the world for our category. We believe the U.S. convenient nutrition category can be broken down into four key consumer need states as defined by our management: everyday nutrition, adult nutrition, sports nutrition and weight management. 
 While we believe most brands in the convenient nutrition category are positioned to appeal to consumers primarily in one need state, Premier Protein has developed brand equities and product value propositions to appeal to a broad range of consumer need states. We primarily compete in the everyday nutrition and sports nutrition consumer need states, but also appeal to the adult nutrition and weight management consumer need states. We define everyday nutrition as nutritious products that can be

Table of Contents 

 consumed throughout the day as part of a healthy lifestyle. Our Dymatize brand is focused primarily on sports nutrition, which we define as consumers looking to supplement sports endurance and body building needs. 
 Brand Overview 
 Our primary brands, based on fiscal 2023 sales, are Premier Protein and Dymatize . Together our brands cover the major product forms in the convenient nutrition category and appeal to a broad range of consumer need states. Our percentage of net sales by brand for our year ended September 30, 2023 were as follows: Premier Protein , 83.2 ; Dymatize , 14.0 ; and other, 2.8 . 
 Two product forms accounted for the substantial majority of our fiscal 2023 net sales. In our year ended September 30, 2023, RTD protein shakes and other RTD beverages were 79.6 of our net sales, and powders were 17.4 of our net sales. 
 Premier Protein 
 Our largest brand, Premier Protein , is a leading mainstream, lifestyle brand. Premier Protein s product portfolio consists primarily of RTD protein shakes and protein powders. Premier Protein s flagship RTD protein shakes are available in 14 flavors (including 3 seasonal flavors) and contain 30 grams of protein with only one gram of sugar and 160 calories. They are gluten- and soy-free, low fat and fortified with 24 vitamins and minerals. Our RTD protein shakes are formulated to deliver great-tasting, leading protein levels while maintaining one of the leanest nutritional profiles in the category (as measured by sugar and calorie content). Premier Protein s powder portfolio consists primarily of 100 whey protein products. We believe the product profile appeals to consumers across age ranges in all four need states. 
 Dymatize 
 Our Dymatize brand is a market leader targeting fitness enthusiasts who value the brand for its science-based product development, athletic performance focus and great taste. The brand s portfolio includes an assortment of sports nutrition products, including protein powders. The majority of Dymatize s sales are generated through protein powders. Our protein powder portfolio consists of three primary products: ISO.100 made with hydrolyzed 100 Whey Protein Isolate, Elite 100 Whey and Super Mass Gainer. ISO.100 , the brand s flagship product, has a global reach with sales in more than seventy countries. In addition to ISO.100 , Dymatize offers a suite of products to meet the needs of athletes. 
 Our Customers 
 Our customers are predominantly club stores, FDM retailers, online retailers, specialty retailers, convenience stores and distributors. We sell our products domestically and in more than seventy countries globally. Our U.S. business represented 89.5 of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2023, and our international business represented 10.5 of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our largest customers, Costco, Walmart (which includes its affiliates, including Sam s Club) and Amazon, accounted for approximately 75.3 of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2023. No other customer accounted for more than 10 of our fiscal 2023 net sales. 
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 In the U.S., we utilize a direct sales force in multiple channels, including club, FDM, convenience, specialty and eCommerce. We also sell through a broker network for customers in the convenience, grocery and mass channels, and through distributors for the specialty channel. In international markets, we sell our products through a combination of direct sales to retailers and to third-party distributors. We utilize a direct sales force in key markets in Western Europe for multiple channels, including specialty, FDM and eCommerce. We also sell through distributors in the specialty channel.

 Our products are distributed through a network of third-party common carriers. 
 Research and Development 
 We continue to improve and expand our product offerings with new flavors, ingredients, packaging, product forms and process development technologies. We leverage our dedicated market research, consumer insights and innovation teams, supplemented by leading design firms, product development companies, third-party flavor houses and consultants. 
 Supply Chain 
 Raw Materials . Raw materials used in our business consist of ingredients and packaging materials purchased from local, regional and international suppliers. Our principal ingredients include milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins, protein blends, sweeteners and vitamin and mineral blends. Our primary packaging materials include aseptic foil and plastic lined cardboard cartons, flexible and rigid plastic film and containers, beverage packaging and corrugate. We purchase our raw materials in accordance with rigorous standards to assure food quality and safety. Supply availability and prices paid for raw materials can fluctuate widely due to external factors, such as pandemics and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, weather conditions, labor disputes, governmental programs, regulations and trade and tariff policies, industry consolidation, economic climate, energy shortages, transportation delays, commodity market prices, currency fluctuations and other unforeseen circumstances. The convenient nutrition industry, like many others, experienced inflationary pressure in our fiscal 2023. We continuously monitor supply and cost trends of these raw materials to enable us to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for our products. 
 Under the terms of an agreement with a significant protein powder supplier, Premier Nutrition is required to purchase a minimum periodic volume of protein powder and has the right (but not the obligation) to order quantities in excess of such minimum amount provided the supplier has the capacity and the ability to produce such additional quantities. The agreement also contains detailed provisions regarding the product specifications and quality standards for the raw materials to be provided by the supplier, the rights of a party in the event the other party does not comply with its obligations under the agreement and other customary contractual terms and conditions. The agreement expires on June 30, 2028. 
 Energy. Electricity and steam are used in the facilities that manufacture our products. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products. 
 Manufacturing . We primarily engage third-party contract manufacturers in North America and the European Union (the E.U. ). to produce our products. We receive products from our third-party contract manufacturers for an agreed-upon tolling charge for each item produced as well as other minor costs. Most of our relationships with our contract manufacturing partners include minimum volume commitments, whereby the third-party contract manufacturer has committed to produce, and we have committed to purchase, a minimum quantity of product. We own a manufacturing plant in Voerde, Germany that supplies nutrition bars and gels primarily for the E.U., Switzerland and the United Kingdom (the U.K. ). 
 We regularly monitor the capacity and performance of our third-party contract manufacturing partners and suppliers and qualify new contract manufacturing partners and suppliers as needed. Given the growth profile of our primary products, we continuously plan for incremental capacity, including adding new third-party contract manufacturing partners in fiscal 2023 and working to qualify additional third-party contract manufacturing partners and sites for fiscal 2024, and review additional strategic alternatives to support our business. 
 From three separate and geographically diverse manufacturing locations, our largest third-party contract manufacturer provided approximately 53.8 of our Premier Protein RTD shake supply for our year ended September 30, 2023. Under the terms of a manufacturing agreement with the third-party contract manufacturer, Premier Nutrition is required to purchase a minimum quarterly order volume of RTD protein shakes and has the right (but not the obligation) to order quantities in excess of a monthly minimum amount provided the third-party contract manufacturer has the capacity and the ability to produce such additional quantities. In addition, under the terms of the manufacturing agreement, the third-party contract manufacturer has committed to produce a quarterly minimum volume of RTD protein shakes. The manufacturing agreement also contains detailed provisions regarding the product specifications and quality standards for the products to be manufactured and packaged by the third-party contract manufacturer, the tolling charges for each item produced (and certain other costs) to be paid by Premier Nutrition (and related payment terms), shipping and storage obligations, the rights of a party in the event the other party does not comply with its obligations under the manufacturing agreement and other customary contractual terms and conditions. This agreement expires on December 31, 2027. 
 We regularly evaluate our contract manufacturing arrangements to ensure the cost-effective manufacturing of our products. We select our manufacturing partners based on expertise, quality, cost and location. Our quality assurance team frequently monitors manufacturing partners to ensure our partners meet our rigorous processing and quality standards, detailed in our Quality Expectations Manual, including requirements for third-party certification of Good Manufacturing Practices. Our owned

 production plant in Voerde, Germany is additionally certified to one of the international Food Safety Standards (FSSC 22.000, IFS or BRC), SMETA 4-pillars (Labour, Environment, Health and Safety, Business Ethics) and ISO 45001 (Health and Safety). 
 Distribution . In North America, our products typically are shipped directly from our contract manufacturing partners to a network of third-party warehouses. Products are distributed from third-party warehouses to customer distribution centers or retail stores or are exported by our distribution partners to international customers. Occasionally, we ship products directly from our third-party contract manufacturers to our customers distribution centers. 
 We maintain one third-party warehouse location in Germany, which receives products from our production facility located in Voerde, Germany or directly from our third-party contract manufacturers. Our branded products are distributed from third-party warehouses to customer distribution centers or retail stores or are exported to international customers. 
 Competition 
 The convenient nutrition category in which we operate is highly competitive and highly sensitive to both pricing and promotion. We compete with other brands, including private label and store brand products, and with many nutritional food and beverage players. We have numerous competitors of varying sizes, including manufacturers of other branded food and beverage products, as well as manufacturers of private label products. Some of our competitors have substantially more financial, marketing and other resources than us. Competition in our industry is based on, among other things, product quality, taste, functional benefits, nutritional value and ingredients, convenience, brand loyalty and positioning, product variety, product packaging, shelf space, price, promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in our industry include strong and impactful marketing to build awareness of our products, effective customer relationship management, category insights, superior product quality and food safety, product innovation, an efficient supply chain and competitive pricing. We expect the industry we operate in to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. 
 Seasonality 
 We experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and earnings before interest and taxes EBIT margins because of consumer spending patterns and timing of our key retailers promotional activity. Historically, our first quarter of the fiscal year is seasonally low for net sales for all brands driven by a slowdown of consumption of our products during the holiday season. Sales are typically higher throughout the remainder of the fiscal year as a result of stronger consumer demand in our second quarter of the fiscal year, promotional activity at key retailers and organic growth of the business. Seasonal fluctuations in our sales and EBIT margins may not be the same in the future as they have been historically. 
 Trademarks and Intellectual Property 
 We own or have licenses to use a number of trademarks that are critical to the success of our business. Our key trademarks include BellRing , BellRing Brands , Premier Protein , Premier Nutrition , Dymatize , ISO.100 and PowerBar , each of which we own, as well as trademarks that we license from third parties, such as Pebbles and Dunkin . Our owned trademarks are, in most cases, protected through registration in the U.S. or Germany, as well as in many other countries where the related brands or products are sold. We also own, or have applications pending, for several patents in the U.S. and other countries. While our patent portfolio as a whole is material to our business, no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business. In addition, we have copyrights, proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered. 
 We rely on a combination of trademark law, copyright law, trade secrets, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements and provisions in agreements and other measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights to our products, packaging, processes and intellectual property. 
 Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to regulation by federal, state and local governmental entities and agencies in the U.S., as well as similar regulations in Canada, Mexico, Europe and other international locations, including food safety laws, labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, consumer protection regulations, worker health and safety regulations, environmental laws and regulations and other laws and regulations. 
 Our products are regulated in the U.S. either as food or dietary supplements, which internationally may be regulated as pharmaceuticals or other health food categories. As a producer and distributor of goods for human consumption, we must comply with stringent production, storage, recordkeeping, distribution, labeling and marketing standards established by the Food and Drug Administration (the FDA ), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the USDA ), the Federal Trade Commission and state and local agencies in the U.S. We also must comply with standards established by similar regulatory agencies in Canada, Mexico, the E.U. and elsewhere. In addition, some of our products are produced and marketed under contract as part of special certification programs such as organic, kosher or non-GMO, and must comply with the strict standards of federal, state

 and third-party certifying organizations. Products that do not meet regulatory or third-party standards may be considered adulterated or misbranded and subject to withdrawal or recall. Additionally, following the adoption of the Food Safety Modernization Act in the U.S. and the Safe Foods for Canadians Act in Canada, the FDA and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency are implementing additional regulations focused on prevention of food contamination, more frequent inspection of high-risk facilities, increased record-keeping and improved tracing of food. 
 Our manufacturing facility in Germany is subject to certain safety regulations, including the German Occupational Safety and Health Regulation. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. Additionally, some of the food commodities on which our business relies are subject to governmental agricultural programs (e.g., subsidies and import/export regulations), which have substantial effects on the prices and supplies of these commodities. 
 In addition, our operations are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy, data protection and data security, including the General Data Protection Regulation, the E.U. s retained law version of the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, each of which applies to certain aspects of our business and regulate how businesses collect, use and protect personal information obtained from data subjects. As a company with international operations, we also are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and other countries related to anti-corruption, antitrust and competition and economic sanctions. 
 Our business also is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air quality, wastewater and storm water management, waste handling and disposal and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment.

Our people are critical to our success and we prioritize providing a safe, rewarding and respectful workplace where our people are provided with opportunities to pursue career paths based on skills, performance and mindset. We adhere to our Code of Conduct, which sets forth a commitment to our stakeholders, including our employees, to operate with integrity and mutual respect. 
 Health and Safety 
 We are committed to maintaining a healthy and safe workplace for our employees. In our Voerde, Germany manufacturing facility, we have a comprehensive safety and risk management system in place that incorporates rigorous safety standards and practices, employee and leadership training to ensure consistent implementation of our safety protocols and periodic internal and external audits to evaluate our compliance with these policies. 
 Talent Acquisition, Development, Engagement and Retention 
 Acquiring, developing, engaging and retaining a diverse and talented workforce is key to accomplishing our goals and achieving business results. 
 Our talent acquisition processes include diversity training for recruiters and employee training on interview skills and processes to improve our candidate selection process. For candidate selection roundtables, we have a trained, disinterested employee sit in to help mitigate any instances of bias in the selection discussion. We have also expanded outreach to diverse candidate pools and career fairs to enable us to reach a wider audience of candidates, as well as expanding our lens on hiring people from non-traditional backgrounds or career paths. 
 Providing development opportunities and resources for our employees is another key factor in our human capital strategy. We offer a variety of training and development programs and platforms for employees at all levels of our organization, including monthly development trainings for people leaders of all levels, along with in-depth workshops for both new and existing managers. 
 We check in with our employees through regular engagement surveys, small group and one-on-one interviews and then act on those survey results, as appropriate. Employee-led groups, opportunities to participate in informal wellness activities and philanthropic work are informed by what our employees identify as important to them. We measure our progress and take additional actions, as needed. We communicate transparently with our employees about the organization to keep our employees informed and engaged.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 In addition to the information discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although the risks below are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Industry and Operating Risks 
 A substantial amount of our net sales comes from our RTD protein shakes, and a decrease in sales of our RTD protein shakes would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 A substantial amount of our net sales is derived from our RTD protein shakes. Sales of our RTD protein shakes represented approximately 79.6 of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2023. We believe that sales of our RTD protein shakes will continue to constitute a substantial amount of our net sales for the foreseeable future. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be harmed by a decline in the market for our RTD protein shakes, increased competition in the market for those products, disruptions in our ability to produce those products, whether due to manufacturer inability, supply chain failures or otherwise, or our failure or inability to provide sufficient investment to support and market those products as needed to maintain or grow their competitive position or to achieve more widespread market acceptance. 
 We operate in a category with strong competition. 
 The convenient nutrition category in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other brands in the convenient nutrition category and with many nutritional food and beverage players, as well as manufacturers of private label and store brand products. Many of our competitors offer products similar to our products, or a wider range of products than we offer, and may offer their products at more competitive prices than we do. Competition in our industry is based on, among other things, product quality, taste, functional benefits, nutritional value and ingredients, convenience, brand loyalty and positioning, product variety, product packaging, shelf space, price, promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Some of our principal competitors have substantially more financial, marketing and other resources than we have. A strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a shift in consumer preferences to competitors products, could result in us reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share. Competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase our prices, including in response to cost increases. Our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume. In addition, our competitors are increasingly using social media networks to advertise products. If we are unable to use social media effectively to advertise our products, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Disruption of our supply chain and changes in weather conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our ability to make, move and sell products in coordination with our suppliers, third-party contract manufacturers and distributors is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our collective supply, manufacturing or distribution capabilities resulting from weather, freight carrier availability, any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, pandemics or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, governmental restrictions or mandates, labor shortages, border closures, freight carrier availability, agricultural diseases, fires or evacuations related thereto, explosions, cyber incidents, terrorism, strikes or other labor unrest, repairs or enhancements at facilities manufacturing or delivering our products or other reasons could impair our ability to source inputs or manufacture, sell or timely deliver our products. During fiscal 2021 and 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our operations, including causing disruptions in our supply chain. 
 Changes in weather conditions and natural disasters, such as fires, floods, droughts, frosts, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, insect infestations and plant disease, also may affect the cost and supply of commodities used as raw materials, including milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins, protein blends, sweeteners and vitamin and mineral blends. Further, as we rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers to provide certain ingredients and packaging materials, and one supplier for the majority of our milk-based protein, adverse events affecting such suppliers may limit our ability to obtain such raw materials, or alternatives for these raw materials, at competitive prices, or at all. For example, for our year ended September 30, 2023, approximately 53.8 of our Premier Protein RTD shake supply came from our largest third-party contract manufacturer, with approximately 31.9 of our Premier Protein RTD shake supply manufactured at its Joplin, Missouri facility. In addition, production of the RTD protein shakes in the 11 ounce size by our third-party contract manufacturers requires packaging that we currently are sourcing from only one supplier, and equipment that our third-party contract manufacturers are currently sourcing from the same supplier. Our supply of packaging for our 11 ounce RTD protein shakes from this supplier comes primarily from three of its locations. Competitors can be affected differently by weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their suppliers and operations.

Table of Contents 

 We are currently dependent on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for the manufacturing of most of our products, including one manufacturer for the majority of our RTD protein shakes. Our business could suffer if we do not continue to contract with key third-party manufacturers or as a result of a third-party contract manufacturer s inability to produce our products for us in the quantities required, on time or to our specifications. 
 All of our RTD protein shakes and most of our other products are manufactured by a limited number of independent third-party contract manufacturers. For our year ended September 30, 2023, approximately 53.8 of our Premier Protein RTD shake supply came from a single manufacturer and approximately 31.9 from a single facility of that manufacturer. Although we have added additional third-party contract manufacturers of our Premier Protein RTD shakes to our third-party contract manufacturing network, our number of third-party contract manufacturers is still limited and if one or more of our third-party contract manufacturers is unable to meet our supply requirements, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In fiscal 2019, a former third-party contract manufacturer that we had expected to produce less than 10 of our RTD protein shakes for that year did not produce as we expected, which resulted in our termination of our agreement with it. Also, if we experience significant increases in demand for our products, as we did beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2023, we and these third-party contract manufacturers may not be able to obtain in a timely manner the equipment, ingredients or packaging materials required to manufacture our products and allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements, fill our orders in a timely manner or meet our quality standards. Further, as we did in fiscal 2022 and 2023, we may experience operational difficulties with any of these third-party contract manufacturers, such as limitations on production capacity, failure to meet our quantity requirements, including as a result of pandemics or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, increases in manufacturing costs, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control and failure to meet production deadlines. We have had to limit our stock-keeping units SKUs and place one or more of our products on allocation. In addition, we rely in part on our third-party contract manufacturers to maintain the quality of our products. The failure or inability of our third-party contract manufacturers to comply with the specifications and requirements of our products could result in product withdrawal or recall, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and subject us to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause or be claimed to cause illness or physical harm. For example, in fiscal 2022, a third-party manufacturer that produced less than 2 of our Premier Protein RTD protein shakes initiated a recall of all products manufactured in one of its facilities, including our Premier Protein RTD protein shakes. The inability of third-party contract manufacturers to ship orders in a timely manner, in desirable quantities or to meet our safety, quality and social compliance standards or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, our business could be adversely affected if any of these third parties fail to comply with governmental regulations applicable to the manufacturing of our products or if any of these third parties cease doing business with us or go out of business. 
 Certain of our relationships with these third parties are subject to minimum volume commitments, whereby the third-party contract manufacturer has committed to produce, and we have committed to purchase, a minimum quantity of product, and we or the contract manufacturer may alternatively pay the other a mostly fixed amount rather than produce or purchase the minimum quantities. Despite the minimum volume commitments, we may nonetheless experience situations where such manufacturers are unable to fulfill their minimum volume obligations under our agreements or cannot produce sufficient amounts of product to meet consumer demand. For example, due to (i) better than expected volume growth for our Premier Protein RTD shakes and Dymatize powders in the second half of fiscal 2021 and in fiscal 2022 and, as to Premier Protein RTD shakes in fiscal 2023, (ii) delays in production and planned incremental production capacity by our third-party contract manufacturer network and (iii) in the case of Dymatize powders, whey protein availability, our customer demand exceeded our available capacity and resulted in Premier Protein RTD shakes and Dymatize powders inventories below acceptable levels during fiscal 2021 and Premier Protein RTD shakes inventories below acceptable levels in fiscal 2022 and into fiscal 2023. If we need to replace an existing third-party contract manufacturer, our products may not be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all. Also, if demand for our products is significantly below our expectations, we may be obligated to pay penalties to our third-party contract manufacturers for failing to purchase contracted minimum purchase quantities. 
 Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers for certain equipment, ingredients and packaging materials, the price and availability of ingredients and packaging materials, higher freight costs and higher energy costs could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers to provide certain equipment, ingredients and packaging materials used in our business. The primary ingredients used in our business include milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins, protein blends, sweeteners and vitamin and mineral blends, and one supplier provides the majority of our milk-based protein. The supply and price of these ingredients are subject to market conditions and are influenced by many factors beyond our control, including labor shortages, pandemics or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, animal feed costs, weather patterns affecting ingredient production, governmental programs and regulations, insects, plant diseases and inflation. Our milk-based protein costs have increased and may continue to increase due to factors such as labor shortages, pandemics or other outbreaks

 of contagious diseases, animal feed costs, weather patterns affecting ingredient production, governmental programs and regulations, insects, plant diseases and inflation. Our primary packaging materials include aseptic foil and plastic lined cardboard cartons, flexible and rigid plastic film and containers, beverage packaging and corrugate. We utilize a sole supplier for the aseptic packaging for, and our third-party contract manufacturers use equipment from the same sole supplier to manufacture, our Premier Protein RTD shakes in the 11 ounce size. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of such ingredients and packaging materials, increases in demand for such items, both within our industry and in general, can result in shortages and higher costs. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we may lose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications and we may not be able to purchase such items at a competitive cost. Further, the supply and price of these inputs are subject to market conditions and are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including labor shortages, pandemics and other outbreaks of contagious diseases weather conditions, natural disasters, governmental programs, regulations and trade and tariff policies, insects, plant diseases, inflation and increased demand. Our freight costs may increase due to factors such as labor shortages, increased fuel costs, limited carrier availability, increased compliance costs associated with new or changing government regulations, pandemics or other outbreaks of contagious diseases and inflation. Higher prices for natural gas, propane, electricity and fuel also may increase our ingredient, production and delivery costs. Historically, the prices of certain of our raw materials, energy and other supplies used in our business have fluctuated widely. In addition, we have experienced shortages of certain of our raw materials, which result in us paying increased costs for such inputs and impact our ability to produce our products. 
 The prices charged for our products may not reflect changes in our input costs at the time they occur, or at all. Accordingly, changes in input costs may limit our ability to maintain existing margins and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While we try to manage the impact of increases in certain of these costs by locking in prices on quantities required to meet our anticipated production requirements, if we fail, or are unable, to hedge and prices subsequently increase, or if we institute a hedge and prices subsequently decrease, our costs may be greater than anticipated or greater than our competitors costs, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 We must identify changing consumer and customer preferences and behaviors and develop and offer products to meet these preferences. 
 Consumer and customer preferences and behaviors evolve over time due to a variety of factors. The success of our business depends on our ability to identify these changing preferences and behaviors, to distinguish between short-term trends and long-term changes in such preferences and behaviors, and to continue to develop and offer products that appeal to consumers and customers through the sales channels that they prefer. Consumer preference and behavior changes include dietary trends, attention to different nutritional aspects of foods and beverages, acceptance and the use of weight management medication, consumer in-home and on-the-go consumption patterns, preferences for certain sales channels, concerns regarding the health effects of certain foods and beverages, attention to sourcing practices relating to ingredients, animal welfare concerns, environmental concerns regarding packaging and attention to other social and governance aspects of our Company and operations. Several of our customers have announced goals to transition to recyclable, compostable or reusable packaging. These changing preferences and requirements could require us to use specially sourced ingredients and packaging types that may be more difficult to source or entail a higher cost or incremental capital investment which we may not be able to pass on to customers. 
 Consumers are increasingly shopping through eCommerce websites and mobile commerce applications and this trend is significantly altering the retail landscape in our category. If we are unable to effectively compete in the expanding eCommerce market or develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights, our business performance may be impacted, which may negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Emerging science and theories regarding health are constantly evolving, and products or methods of eating once considered healthy may over time become disfavored by consumers or no longer be perceived as healthy. Approaches regarding healthy lifestyles also are the subject of numerous studies and publications, often with differing views and opinions, some of which may be adverse to us. The growing acceptance and use of medication to manage weight could negatively affect the demand for many types of food in general, including our products. In order to respond to new and evolving consumer and customer demands, achieve market acceptance and keep pace with new nutritional, technological and other developments, we must constantly introduce new and innovative products into the market. We may not be successful in developing, introducing on a timely basis or marketing any new or enhanced products, and specifically, the initial sales volumes for new or enhanced products may not reach anticipated levels, we may be required to engage in extensive marketing efforts to promote such products, the costs of developing and promoting such products may exceed our expectations and such products may not perform as expected. Further, certain ingredients used in our products may become negatively perceived by consumers, resulting in decreased demand for our products or reformulation of existing products to remove such ingredients, which may negatively affect taste or other qualities.

 Prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. 
 Although we strive to respond to consumer or customer preferences and social expectations, we may not be successful in these efforts. Any significant changes in consumer or customer preferences or our inability to anticipate or react, or effectively introduce new products in response, to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain favorable perceptions of our brands. 
 Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including our products becoming unavailable to consumers, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, adverse publicity about our or our suppliers or third-party contract manufacturers business practices, our products, packaging or ingredients, concerns about food safety, real or perceived health concerns regarding our products or consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner. Consumer demand for our products also may be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. We may need to increase our marketing and advertising spending in order to maintain and increase customer and consumer awareness, protect and grow our existing market share or to promote new products, which could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. However, an increase in our marketing and advertising efforts may not maintain our current reputation or lead to an increase in brand awareness. Negative perceptions of the food and beverage industry as a whole, or the convenient nutrition category, may heighten attention from consumers, third parties, the media, governments, stockholders and other stakeholders to such factors and could adversely affect our brand image. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers, us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging or the food and beverage industry generally on social or digital media (whether factual or not) or security breaches related to use of our social media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain favorable perceptions of our products and our brands, or if we experience a loss of consumer confidence in our brands, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. 
 In addition, our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand image depends on our ability to anticipate change and adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online, digital and mobile dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns and the increasing accessibility and speed of dissemination of information. Furthermore, third parties may sell counterfeit or imitation versions of our products that are inferior or pose safety risks. If consumers confuse these counterfeit products for our products or have a bad experience with the counterfeit brand, they might refrain from purchasing our brands in the future, which could harm our brand image and sales. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our reputation and brand health, then our brands, product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Consolidation in our distribution channels, and competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, may hurt our profit margins. 
 Over the past several years, our channels have undergone significant consolidations and mass merchandisers and non-traditional retailers are gaining market share. As this trend continues and such customers grow larger, they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other value brands and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to respond to these requirements, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if any of our customers are consolidated with another entity and the surviving entity of any such consolidation is not a customer or decides to discontinue purchasing our products, we may lose significant amounts of our preexisting business with the acquired customer. Further, the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing, such as the emergence of new sales channels like eCommerce, and our customers responses to those changes could impact our business. Consolidation in our channels also increases the risk that adverse changes to our customers business operations or financial performance would have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our sales and profit growth are dependent upon our ability to expand existing market penetration and enter into new markets. 
 Successful growth depends on our ability to add new customers, enter into new markets, expand the number of products sold through existing customers and enhance our product portfolio. This growth would include expanding the number of our products retailers offer for sale, our product placement and our ability to secure additional shelf or retail space for our products, as well as increased access to online platforms to sell our products. The expansion of our business depends on our ability to obtain new, or expand our business with existing, customers, such as club, FDM, eCommerce, convenience and specialty

 customers. Our failure to successfully add new customers, enter into new markets, expand the number of products sold through existing customers and enhance our product portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 If our products become contaminated or adulterated, or if they are misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall or withdraw those items and we may experience product liability claims. 
 Selling food products, beverages and nutritional supplements involves a number of legal and other risks, including contamination, spoilage, degradation, tampering, mislabeling or other adulteration. Additionally, many of the raw materials used to make certain of our products, particularly milk-based protein, are vulnerable to spoilage and contamination by naturally occurring molds and pathogens, such as salmonella, and pests. These pathogens may survive in our products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers. We do not have control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution. We may need to recall or withdraw some or all of our products if they become damaged, contaminated, adulterated, mislabeled or misbranded, whether caused by us or someone in our manufacturing or supply chain. For example, in fiscal 2022, a third-party manufacturer that produced less than 2 of our Premier Protein RTD protein shakes initiated a recall of all products manufactured in one of its facilities, including our Premier Protein RTD protein shakes. A recall or withdrawal could result in destruction of product ingredients and inventory, negative publicity, temporary plant closings for us or our third-party contract manufacturers, supply chain interruption, substantial costs of compliance or remediation, fines and increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. New scientific discoveries regarding microbes and food manufacturing may bring additional risks and latent liability. Should consumption of any product cause injury, we may be liable for monetary damages as a result of a judgment against us. In addition, adverse publicity, including claims, whether or not valid, that our products or ingredients are unsafe or of poor quality, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Although we have various insurance programs in place and may have rights to indemnification in certain situations, any of these events or a loss of consumer confidence could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Loss of, a significant reduction of purchases by or bankruptcy of a major customer may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 A limited number of customer accounts represents a large percentage of our combined net sales. Our largest customers, Costco, Walmart and its affiliates (which includes Sam s Club) and Amazon, accounted for approximately 75.3 of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2023. 
 The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain our level of sales and product distribution through the club, FDM, eCommerce, specialty and convenience channels. The competition to supply products to these high-volume stores is intense. Currently, we do not have material long-term supply agreements with our customers, and our customers frequently reevaluate the products they carry. A decision by our major customers to decrease the amount of product purchased from us, including in response to shifts in consumer purchasing or traffic trends, sell another brand on an exclusive or priority basis or change the manner of doing business with us could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our customers also may offer branded and private label products that compete directly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, there is a risk that our customers may give higher priority to their own products or to the products of our competitors. In the event of a loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction of purchases by any of our large customers or the bankruptcy or serious financial difficulty of any of our large customers, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
 Fluctuations in our business due to changes in our promotional activities and seasonality may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We periodically offer a variety of sales and promotional incentives to our customers and consumers. Our net sales and profitability are impacted by the introduction and discontinuance of such sales and promotion incentives. In addition, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations due to the seasonal nature of our business. Seasonality could cause our results of operations for an interim financial period to fluctuate and not be indicative of our full year results. Seasonality also impacts relative revenue and profitability of each quarter of the year, both on a quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year basis. If we fail to effectively manage our inventories, fluctuations in business as a result of promotional activities and seasonality may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 Our international operations subject us to additional risks. 
 We are subject to a number of risks related to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our financial and operational performance. These risks include: 
 restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences; 
 unfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export or import restrictions; 
 unfavorable changes in local regulatory requirements that impact our ability to sell our products in that country; 
 unfavorable foreign exchange controls and currency exchange rates; 
 challenges associated with cross-border product distribution; 
 an outbreak of a contagious disease, which may cause us or our distributors, third-party contract manufacturers, vendors or customers to temporarily suspend our or their respective operations in the affected city or country; 
 increased exposure to general market and economic conditions, political and economic uncertainty and volatility and other events, including social unrest, government shutdowns, terrorist activity, acts of war and travel restrictions, outside of the U.S.; 
 compliance with U.S. laws and regulations affecting operations outside of the U.S., including anti-corruption regulations (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), and changes to such laws and regulations; 
 compliance with treaties, antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws (including the E.U. s General Data Protection Regulation), anti-corruption laws (including the U.K. Bribery Act), food safety and marketing laws and other regulatory requirements and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple jurisdictions and changes to such laws and regulations; 
 unfavorable changes in foreign tax treaties and policies, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretations or tax audit implications; 
 the difficulty and costs of maintaining effective data security; 
 the potential difficulty of enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights; 
 increased risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; 
 unfavorable changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing our operations; and 
 the difficulty and costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across geographic regions. 
 Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Because we have operations and assets in foreign jurisdictions, as well as a portion of our contracts and revenues denominated in foreign currencies, and our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Consequently, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements. Our principal currency exposures are to the Canadian dollar and the Euro. To the extent we fail to manage our foreign currency exposure adequately, we may suffer losses in value of our net foreign currency investment, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected. 
 Our market size and related estimates may prove to be inaccurate. 
 Data for the convenient nutrition category is collected for most, but not all, channels, and as a result, it is difficult to estimate the size of the market and predict the rate at which the market for our products will grow. We estimate the market size of the convenient nutrition category, including by geography, product form and consumer need state, based, in part, upon forecasts and information obtained from independent trade associations, industry publications and surveys and other independent sources, proprietary research studies and management s knowledge of the industry. While these estimates are made in good faith and are based on assumptions and estimates we believe to be reasonable, they may not be accurate. 
 Our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them, or termination of our material intellectual property licenses, could reduce the value of our products and brands and have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, know-how and copyrights, to be a significant and valuable asset of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as third-party nondisclosure, confidentiality and assignment agreements and confidentiality provisions in third-party agreements and the policing of third party misuses of our 
 18

 intellectual property. Our failure or inability to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business. We also are subject to risks associated with protection of our trademarks and other intellectual property licensed to distributors of our products and of our trade secrets to our third-party contract manufacturers. If our licensed distributors or third-party contract manufacturers fail to protect our trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property, either intentionally or unintentionally, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
 We market certain of our products pursuant to intellectual property license agreements. These licenses give us the right to use certain names, characters and logos in connection with our products and to sell the products. If we were to breach any material term of these license agreements and not timely cure the breach, the licensor could terminate the agreement. If the licensor were to terminate our rights to use the names, characters and logos for this reason or any other reason, or if a licensor decided not to renew a license agreement upon the expiration of the license term, the loss of such rights could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 We may not be able to effectively manage our growth, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our growth has placed, and we expect that our continued growth may place, a significant demand on our management, personnel, systems and resources. Our continued growth will require an increased investment by us in our third-party manufacturing relationships, personnel, technology, facilities and financial and management systems and controls, including monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations. We will need to integrate, train and manage a growing employee base. Unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with this growth, our operating margins and profitability will be adversely affected. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially harmed. 
 Technology failures, cybersecurity incidents and corruption of our data privacy protections could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business. 
 We rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store operating and financial information, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We also depend upon our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers. The importance of such networks and systems has increased as a greater number of our employees work remotely all or part of the time. Our and our third-party manufacturing and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and control costs. Our and our third-party vendors information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of invasions, interruptions or malfunctions due to events beyond our or their control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, power outages, computer viruses, ransomware and malware, hardware or software failures, cybersecurity incidents, hackers and other causes. Such invasions, interruptions or malfunctions could negatively impact our business. 
 If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes, or if one of our third-party service providers fails to provide the services we require, we could be subject to billing and collection errors, business disruptions or damage resulting from such events, particularly material security breaches and cybersecurity incidents. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored institutions, terrorist organizations and individuals or groups participating in organized crime) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons). 
 If any of our significant information technology systems suffers severe damage, disruption or shutdown, including by malicious or unintentional actions of contractors or employees or by cyber or ransomware attacks, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, there is a risk of business interruption, litigation and reputational damage from leaks of confidential or personal information. While we have insurance programs in place related to these matters, the potential liabilities associated with such events, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. Although we have not detected a material security breach or cybersecurity incident to date, we have been the target of events of this nature and expect them to continue.

 We also are subject to an evolving body of federal, state and foreign laws, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding data privacy, data protection and data security. Several states as well as foreign governments have laws and regulations regulating how businesses collect, use and protect personal information obtained from their data subjects, including the General Data Protection Regulation, the E.U. s retained version of General Data Protection Regulation, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and we could incur substantial fines, other penalties or litigation related to violations of such laws and regulations. 
 Climate change, or legal or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business, reputation and operations. 
 There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If any of these climate changes has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins, protein blends, sweeteners and vitamin and mineral blends. In addition, increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters may result in damage and disruptions to our manufacturing operations and distribution channels or our third-party contract manufacturers operations, particularly where a product is primarily sourced from a single location. Also, the impacts of these climate changes may cause unpredictable water availability or exacerbate water scarcity. Water is critical to our business, and the lack of available water of acceptable quality may lead to, among other things, adverse effects on our operations. The increasing concern over climate change and related environmental sustainability matters also may result in more federal, state, local and foreign legal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases or conserve and replenish water. If such laws are enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. Further, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively address increased concerns from the media, stockholders and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability and governance matters. In addition, any failure to achieve goals we may set with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment can lead to adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 If we pursue acquisitions or other strategic transactions, we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses. 
 From time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Evaluating potential transactions, including divestitures, requires additional expenditures (including legal, accounting and due diligence expenses, higher administrative costs to support the acquired entities and information technology, personnel and other integration expenses) and may divert the attention of our management from day-to-day operating matters. Companies or operations we acquire or joint ventures we enter into may not be profitable or may not achieve the anticipated profitability that justify our investments. 
 With respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges. The successful integration of acquisitions is complex and depends on our ability to manage the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include, but are not limited to, the following: employees may voluntarily or involuntarily separate from employment with us or the acquired businesses because of the acquisitions; our management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate the acquired businesses; we may encounter obstacles when incorporating the acquired businesses into our operations and management; we may be required to recognize impairment charges; and integration may be more costly or more time consuming and complex or less effective than anticipated. With respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses, we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives, or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges. 
 Our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks and may have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Future acquisitions also could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and depreciation and amortization expenses related to certain tangible and intangible assets and increased operating expenses, all of which could, individually or collectively, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Financial and Economic Risks 
 We have substantial debt, which could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position and which could adversely affect our business. 
 We have a significant amount of debt. As of September 30, 2023, we had 865.0 million in aggregate principal amount of total debt. Additionally, our secured revolving credit facility has a remaining borrowing capacity of 225.0 million as of September 30, 2023 (all of which would be secured when drawn). 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 Our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could: 
 limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by ratings organizations were revised downward; 
 make it more difficult for us to satisfy the terms of our obligations under the terms of our financing arrangements; 
 limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all; 
 limit our flexibility to plan for and to adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements; 
 increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions; and 
 subject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition. 
 Our ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including the impact of pandemics and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, potential changes in consumer and customer preferences and behaviors, the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors. If we do not generate enough cash to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or issue additional equity. 
 Despite our level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks related to our debt leverage, and we may in any event be required to maintain a minimum level of indebtedness. 
 We may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the financing arrangements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness that may be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also may not prevent us from incurring certain obligations that may not constitute indebtedness under the documents governing our indebtedness. 
 The agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests, and failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our financing arrangements contain restrictions, covenants and events of default that, among other things, require us to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to refinance our existing indebtedness. Financing arrangements which we enter into in the future could contain similar restrictions and additionally could require us to comply with similar, new or additional financial tests or to maintain similar, new or additional financial ratios. The terms of our financing arrangements, financing arrangements which we enter into in the future and any future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by limiting the amount of additional borrowings we may incur. These restrictions include compliance with, or maintenance of, certain financial tests and ratios and may limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things: borrow money or guarantee debt; create liens; pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock or other securities; make investments and acquisitions; enter into, or permit to exist, contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; enter into new lines of business; enter into transactions with affiliates; and sell assets or merge with other companies. 
 Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control, including the impact of pandemics and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, could affect our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants. Failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants in our existing or future financing arrangements could result in a default under those arrangements and under other arrangements that may contain cross-default provisions. Our credit agreement contains a covenant that requires us to maintain a total net leverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) not to exceed 6.00:1.00, as measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these arrangements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.

 To service indebtedness and fund other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. 
 Our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations and to fund any planned capital expenditures and other cash needs will depend in part upon the future financial and operating performance of our subsidiaries and upon our ability to renew or refinance borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, our future financial and operating performance, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the impact of pandemics and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, will affect our ability to make these payments. 
 If we are unable to make payments, refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we may consider other options, including: sales of assets; sale of equity; reductions or delays of capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances; or negotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt. 
 Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient, to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 
 Uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, including during periods of high inflation, recessions or other economic disruption, could limit consumer and customer demand for our products, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect us. 
 The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on general or local economic conditions and consumers discretionary spending habits. For instance in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, the U.S. experienced significantly heightened inflationary pressures. In periods of adverse or uncertain economic conditions, including during periods of high inflation or recession concerns, consumers may purchase less of our products, purchase more value or private label products or may forgo certain purchases altogether. In addition, our customers may seek to reduce their inventories in response to those economic conditions. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales. Further, during economic downturns, it may be more difficult to convince consumers to switch to, or continue to use, our brands or convince new users to choose our brands without expensive sampling programs and price promotions. Also, as a result of economic conditions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect profit margins. We experienced inflationary headwinds across our business during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, and we expect certain inflationary pressures to continue into fiscal 2024. This trend could have a materially adverse impact in the future if inflation rates were to significantly exceed our ability to achieve price increases or cost savings. Further, uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, has and could continue to negatively impact the financial stability of our customers or suppliers, which could lead to increased uncollectible receivables or non-performance. Current global geopolitical tensions, including related to Ukraine and Israel and the Middle East, may exacerbate any economic downturn and inflation. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Increases in interest rates may negatively affect our earnings. 
 As of September 30, 2023, the aggregate principal amount of our debt instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was 25.0 million. Higher interest rates will increase the cost of servicing our financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. 
 In addition, the discontinuation, replacement or reform of the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR could affect interest rates and financing costs. LIBOR was discontinued effective June 2023. Our credit agreement provides for relatively new benchmarks or references for determining interest rates, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR and the Sterling Overnight Index Average SONIA ). It is unclear, however, if alternative rates or benchmarks, such as SOFR and SONIA, will be widely adopted, and this uncertainty may impact the liquidity of the SOFR and SONIA loan markets. The new rates may not be as favorable to us as those in effect prior to the discontinuation of LIBOR, and these new rates may be more volatile. Also, there may be uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates or as to the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amounts under the terms of an agreement or instrument that utilizes such rate or benchmark. While we do not expect the transition from LIBOR and the risks related thereto to have a material adverse effect on us, it remains uncertain at this time. 
 Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets could be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings. 
 Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based upon a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to stockholder distributions and financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the then-current state of the economy and our industry generally. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 terms commercially acceptable to us or at all and result in a reduction in our liquidity. Our borrowing costs and access to capital markets also can be adversely affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade. An increase in our borrowing costs, limitations on our ability to access the global capital and credit markets or a reduction in our liquidity can adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 U.S. and global capital and credit market issues, including those that have arisen as a result of heightened inflation and recession or other economic concerns, could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers. 
 U.S. and global credit markets have, from time to time, experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. In fiscal 2023, the U.S. experienced significantly heightened inflationary pressures and we expect certain inflationary pressures to continue into fiscal 2024. This and other events affecting the credit markets also have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on other financial markets in the U.S., which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock or other equity securities or refinance our existing debt, sell our assets or borrow money, if necessary. Our business also could be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. Any of these risks could impair our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business or increase our interest expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Impairment in the carrying value of intangible assets could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we will be required to record impairment charges, which may be significant. 
 Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships and other acquired intangibles. Goodwill is expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows and is not amortized. Our management reviews it for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be impaired. Impairments to intangible assets may be caused by factors outside of our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in industry earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA and revenue multiples, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital (interest rates, etc.) or the loss or bankruptcy of a significant customer. These factors, along with other internal and external factors, could have a significant negative impact on our fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge recorded in our results of operations. No impairments were recorded in the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021. However, we could have impairments in the future. 
 Unsuccessful implementation of business strategies to reduce costs, or unintended consequences of the implementation of such strategies, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Many of our costs, such as freight, raw materials and energy, are outside of our control. Therefore, we must seek to reduce costs in other areas, such as through operating efficiency. If we are not able to complete projects designed to reduce costs and increase operating efficiency on time or within budget, or if the implementation of these projects results in unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees or reduced productivity, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted. In addition, if the cost-saving initiatives we have implemented, or any future cost-saving initiatives, do not generate the expected cost savings and synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
 We have incurred, and we will continue to incur, additional fees, costs and expenses to create and maintain the corporate infrastructure to operate as a public company, and we have and we will continue to experience increased ongoing costs and expenses in connection with being a public company. 
 Prior to our IPO, our business had historically used some of Post s corporate infrastructure and services to support our business functions. The expenses related to establishing and maintaining this infrastructure had been spread across all of Post s businesses and charged to us on a cost-allocation basis. The services historically provided to us by Post included, but were not limited to, finance, information technology, legal, human resources, quality, supply chain and purchasing functions. Following our IPO, we continued to receive some of these services pursuant to a master services agreement with Post, and in connection with the Spin-off, we, Post, Old BellRing and BellRing LLC entered into an amended and restated master services agreement, which was further amended in fiscal 2023. Under the amended and restated master services agreement, Post continues to provide certain of the above described services, and, in general, the services to be provided by Post will continue for the periods specified in the amended and restated master services agreement, but not past March 2026, subject to any subsequent extension or earlier termination as agreed to by the parties. There can be no assurance that all of the functions provided to us by Post under the amended and restated master services agreement will be successfully executed by Post or that we will not have to 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 expend significant efforts or costs materially in excess of those estimated in the master services agreement. Any interruption in these services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, upon termination of the amended and restated master services agreement, we will need to perform these functions ourselves or hire third parties to perform these functions on our behalf. 
 Actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance and our forward-looking statements. 
 From time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in such release and the factors described under Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements in our current and periodic reports filed with the SEC. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed upon procedures with respect to the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The independent registered public accounting firm report included in this document relates to our historical financial statements. It does not extend to any guidance and should not be read to do so. 
 Guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, although presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons. 
 Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance. Investors also should recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecast. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it. 
 Any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the risks or uncertainties set forth in this report could result in actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material. 
 Risks Related to Our Relationship with Post 
 We have overlapping directors and management with Post, which may lead to conflicting interests or the appearance of conflicting interests. 
 Certain of our officers and directors, including Robert V. Vitale, who serves as Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors, also serve as officers or directors of Post. Our officers and members of our Board of Directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at Post have fiduciary duties to Post s shareholders. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting us and Post. In addition, some of our officers or members of our Board of Directors may own equity or options to purchase equity in Post. Such ownership interests may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and Post. The appearance of conflicts of interest created by such overlapping relationships also could impair the confidence of our investors. 
 Our certificate of incorporation could prevent us from benefiting from corporate opportunities that might otherwise have been available to us. 
 Our certificate of incorporation includes certain provisions regulating and defining the conduct of our affairs to the extent that they may involve Post and its directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates and our rights, powers, duties and liabilities and those of our directors, officers, managers, employees and agents in connection with our relationship with Post. In general, and except as may be set forth in any agreement between us and Post, these provisions provide that Post and its affiliates may carry on and conduct any business of any kind, nature or description, whether or not such business is competitive with or in the same or similar lines of business as us; Post and its affiliates may do business with any of our customers, vendors and lessors; and Post and its affiliates may make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments. In addition, these provisions provide that we renounce any interest or expectancy to participate in any business of Post or its affiliates. 
 Moreover, our certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce any interests or expectancy in corporate opportunities which become known to (i) any of our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents who also are directors, officers, 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 employees, agents or affiliates of Post or its affiliates (except that we and our subsidiaries are not deemed affiliates of Post or its affiliates for the purposes of the provision) or (ii) Post or its affiliates. Generally, neither Post nor our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents who also are directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates of Post or its affiliates will be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact that any such person pursues or acquires any corporate opportunity for the account of Post or its affiliates, directs, recommends or transfers such corporate opportunity to Post or its affiliates or does not offer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us because such person has directed or intends to direct such opportunity to Post or one of its affiliates. This renunciation does not extend to corporate opportunities expressly offered to one of our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents, solely in his or her capacity as a director, officer, manager, employee or agent of us. 
 These provisions in our certificate of incorporation will cease to apply at such time as none of the directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates of Post serve as our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents. The corporate opportunity provision may exacerbate conflicts of interest between Post and us because the provision effectively permits one of our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents who also serves as a director, officer, employee, agent or affiliate of Post or its affiliates to choose to direct a corporate opportunity to Post or its affiliates instead of to us. 
 We may be unable to take certain actions because such actions could jeopardize the tax-free status of the Spin-off, and such restrictions could be significant. 
 To preserve the tax-free treatment of the Spin-off, for the initial two-year period following the Spin-off, we are prohibited, except in limited circumstances, from taking or failing to take certain actions that would prevent the Spin-off and related transactions from being tax-free, including: (i) issuing any equity securities or securities that could possibly be converted into our equity securities, including as acquisition currency for a merger or acquisition (but excluding certain equity compensation for employees); (ii) redeeming or repurchasing our equity securities or our debt or (iii) entering into any transaction pursuant to which our stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise. These restrictions will not apply if we deliver an unqualified will -level tax opinion of a nationally recognized accounting firm or law firm BellRing Tax Counsel or a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS that the action will not cause such Spin-off to fail to qualify for its intended tax treatment. 
 We may be responsible for U.S. federal income tax liabilities that relate to the Spin-off. 
 The completion of the Spin-off by Post was conditioned on the receipt by Post of an opinion of a nationally recognized accounting firm or law firm (the distribution tax counsel and, together with BellRing tax counsel, tax counsel to the effect that the Separation, together with certain contributions made by Post to us, should qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code and the Distribution should qualify as a tax-free distribution eligible for nonrecognition within the meaning of Sections 355 and 361 of the Code. The completion of the Spin-off was also conditioned on the receipt by us of an opinion of BellRing Tax Counsel to the effect that the merger of Merger Sub with and into Old BellRing qualified as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or, alternatively, as a transaction qualifying for nonrecognition of gain and loss under Section 351 of the Code. An opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the IRS. Accordingly, the IRS may reach conclusions with respect to the distribution that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinions, and any such differing conclusions may result in U.S. federal income tax liability. The opinions will be based on certain factual statements and representations, which, if incomplete or untrue in any material respect, could alter tax counsel s conclusions. We are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause any such factual statements or the opinion of tax counsel to be incomplete or untrue. 
 If all or a portion of the Spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction for any reason, including because any of the factual statements or representations in the legal opinions are incomplete or untrue, Post may recognize a substantial gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and we may incur indemnification or other liabilities to Post as a result. 
 Even if the Distribution otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Distribution will be taxable to Post (but not to Post shareholders) pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if there are (or have been) one or more acquisitions (including issuances), directly or indirectly (including through acquisitions of such stock after the completion of the Transactions), of our stock or the stock of Post, representing 50 percent or more, measured by vote or value, of the stock of any such corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Distribution. The process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex, inherently factual in nature, and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. In general, any acquisition of our common stock within two years before or after the Distribution (with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5 percent stockholders and certain compensatory stock issuances) generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted. The resulting tax liability would be substantial. 
 We have agreed not to enter into certain transactions that could cause any portion of the Distribution to be taxable to Post, including under Section 355(e) of the Code. Pursuant to a tax matters agreement with Post, we have also agreed to indemnify 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 Post for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions or other actions we take, and Post has agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from transactions entered into by Post. These obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of us. 
 In addition, pursuant to the tax matters agreement, if and to the extent the distribution does not qualify as a tax-free transaction, such failure to qualify as a tax-free transaction gives rise to adjustments to the tax basis of assets held by us and our subsidiaries, and we are not required to indemnify Post for any tax liabilities resulting from such failure to qualify as a tax-free transaction, then Post will be entitled to periodic payments from us equal to 85 of the tax savings arising from the aggregate increase to the tax basis of assets held by us and our subsidiaries resulting from such failure and Post and we will negotiate in good faith the terms of a tax receivable agreement to govern the calculation of such payments applying the principles of, and adhering as closely as practicable to, the existing tax receivable agreement between Post and BellRing. Payments under such tax receivable agreement may be substantial, and in certain cases may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement. 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 Violations of laws or regulations by us or our third-party contract manufacturers, as well as new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations, could adversely affect our business. 
 Our business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local government authorities in the U.S., as well as government authorities outside of the U.S., including requirements related to food safety, quality, manufacturing, processing, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling, distribution and worker health and workplace safety. Our activities, both inside and outside of the U.S., are subject to extensive regulation. In the U.S., we are regulated by, and our activities are affected by, among other federal, state and local authorities and regulations, the FDA, the USDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Proposition 65. In Europe, we are regulated by, among other authorities, the U.K. s Food Standards Agency, Health and Safety Executive, Environment Agency, Environmental Health, the Information Commissioners Office and the Trading Standards Office and their equivalents in E.U. member states. We also are regulated by similar authorities elsewhere in the world where our products are distributed. 
 Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, tariffs, import and export restrictions, healthcare costs, energy usage, data privacy and immigration and labor issues, any or all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or the businesses of our customers, suppliers or third-party contract manufacturers. In addition, we could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. We also may be impacted by changes to administrative policies, such as business restrictions, tariffs and trade agreements, in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products. 
 The impact of current laws and regulations, changes in, or changes in interpretations of, these laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or third-party contract manufacturers, causing our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to be adversely affected. Further, if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, revocations of required licenses, detention, seizure, injunctions or recalls, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 It also is possible that federal, state, local or foreign enforcement authorities might take regulatory or enforcement action, which could result in significant fines or penalties , revocations of required licenses or injunctions, as well as potential criminal sanctions . If we are found to be significantly out of compliance, an enforcement authority could issue a warning letter and/or institute enforcement actions that could result in additional costs, substantial delays in production or even a temporary shutdown in manufacturing and product sales. Also, we may have to recall product or otherwise remove product from the market, and temporarily cease its manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Any product liability claims resulting from the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations would be expensive to defend and could result in substantial damage awards against us or harm our reputation. Any of these events would negatively impact our revenues and costs of operations. 
 We also may be impacted by changes to administrative policies, such as business restrictions, tariffs and trade agreements, in markets in which we or our third-party contract manufacturers manufacture, sell or distribute our products. 
 Certain of our products are subject to a higher level of regulatory scrutiny, resulting in increased costs of operations and the potential for delays in product sales. 
 Certain of our products are regulated by the FDA as dietary supplements, which are subject to FDA regulations and levels of regulatory scrutiny different from those applicable to conventional food. Internationally, the convenient nutrition category is regulated as food and dietary supplements. Such heightened regulatory scrutiny results in increased costs of operations and the 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 potential for delays in product sales. In addition, there is some risk that product classifications could be changed by the regulators, which could result in significant fines, penalties, discontinued distribution and relabeling costs. Any of these events would negatively impact our revenues and costs of operations. 
 Pending and future litigation and claims may impair our reputation or lead us to incur significant costs. 
 We are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to contracts, third-party contract manufacturers, intellectual property infringement, product recalls, product liability, false or deceptive advertising, employment matters, environmental matters or other aspects of our business. There has been a recent increase in lawsuits filed against food and beverage companies alleging deceptive advertising and labeling. In addition, actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, may result in legal claims or litigation against us. Negative publicity resulting from allegations made in lawsuits or claims asserted against us, whether or not valid, may adversely affect our reputation. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, be required to modify our business processes, practices or products or be required to stop selling certain of our products. For instance, one of our operating subsidiaries, Premier Nutrition, LLC, is a defendant in several class action lawsuits related to its Joint Juice product, which it discontinued in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. At September 30, 2023, we had accrued 21.0 million related to these matters. In addition, intellectual property infringement litigation or claims could cause us to cease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require us to redesign or rebrand our products or packaging, if feasible, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party s intellectual property. Any or all of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The outcome of litigation is often difficult to predict, and the outcome of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Although we have various insurance programs in place, the potential liabilities associated with lawsuits and claims could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. In addition, insurance carriers may seek to rescind or deny coverage with respect to pending or future claims or lawsuits. If we do not have sufficient coverage under our policies, or if coverage is denied, we may be required to make material payments to settle litigation or satisfy any judgment. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We are subject to environmental laws and regulations that can impose significant costs and expose us to potential financial liabilities. 
 We and our contract manufacturers and other vendors and suppliers are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those limiting the discharge and release of pollutants into the environment and those regulating the transport, storage, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous wastes. Certain environmental laws and regulations can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties, including past and present owners and operators of sites, related to cleaning up sites at which hazardous materials were disposed of or released. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in severe fines and penalties by governments or courts of law. In addition, future laws may more stringently regulate the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide and methane. 
 Future events, such as new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations, new environmental claims, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions requiring responsive action or more vigorous interpretations or enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations, might require us to incur additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 The market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile. 
 The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risk factors listed in this report or for reasons unrelated to our specific performance, such as reports by industry analysts, our failure to meet analysts earnings estimates, investor perceptions, or negative developments relating to our customers, competitors or suppliers, as well as general economic and industry conditions. Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. 
 We may not declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. 
 We may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment. We have not paid cash dividends to date and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Consequently, our stockholders must rely on sales of their shares of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Any future determination to pay dividends, including timing and amount, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to, among other things, our compliance with applicable law, and depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements, business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Our ability to pay dividends depends on our receipt of cash dividends from our operating subsidiaries and our ability to pay dividends may be further restricted as a result of the laws of our subsidiaries jurisdictions of organization or their agreements, including agreements governing indebtedness. 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Delaware law may discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of the Company, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. 
 Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL could delay or prevent a third party from entering into a strategic transaction with us, as applicable, even if such transaction would benefit our stockholders. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: 
 divide the members of the Board of Directors into three classes with staggered three-year terms, which may delay or prevent a change of our management or a change on control; 
 authorize the issuance of blank-check preferred stock that could be issued by us upon approval of the Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares of capital stock, making a takeover more difficult and expensive; 
 provide that directors may be removed from office only for cause and that any vacancy or newly created directorships on the Board of Directors may only be filled by a majority of directors then in office, which may make it difficult for other stockholders to reconstitute the Board of Directors; 
 provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only upon the request of a majority of the Board of Directors or by the chairman of the Board of Directors or the chief executive officer; 
 prohibit stockholder action by written consent and require that any action to be taken by stockholders be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders; and 
 require advance notice to be given by stockholders for any stockholder proposals or director nominees. 
 These restrictions and provisions could keep us from pursuing relationships with strategic partners and from raising additional capital, which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position. These restrictions could also limit stockholder value by impeding a sale of the Company. 
 Our certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Court of Chancery (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the State of Delaware) is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: 
 any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; 
 any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; 
 any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL; and 
 any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. 
 This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. However, our certificate of incorporation also provides that U.S. federal courts will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action or proceeding arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than that designated in the Company s exclusive forum provision. Although our certificate of incorporation contains the exclusive forum provision described above, it is possible that a court could find that such a provision is inapplicable for a particular claim or action or that such provision is unenforceable. The exclusive forum provision shall not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. 
 This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers, or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be 
 28

 inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. 
 General Risks 
 Changes in tax laws may adversely affect us, and the IRS or a court may disagree with our tax positions, which may result in adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 There can be no assurance that future tax law changes will not increase the rate of the corporate income tax significantly; impose new limitations on deductions, credits or other tax benefits; or make other changes that may adversely affect the performance of an investment in our stock. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with the positions taken by us, in which case tax penalties and interest may be imposed that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We may not be able to operate successfully if we are unable to recruit, hire, retain and develop key personnel and a qualified and diverse workforce. In addition, temporary workforce disruptions or the inability of our employees to safely perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of illness, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We depend upon the skills, working relationships and continued services of key personnel, including our senior management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals depends upon our ability to recruit, hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse personnel to operate and expand our business. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. If we lose key personnel, or one or more members of our senior management team, and we fail to develop adequate succession plans, or if we fail to hire, retain and develop a sufficient number of qualified and diverse employees to operate and expand our business, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed. 
 Our business is dependent upon our employees being able to safely perform their jobs. If we experience workforce disruptions or periods where our employees are unable to safely perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of illness or restrictions put in place by governmental authorities, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 Increases in labor-related costs, including costs of medical and other employee health and welfare benefits, may reduce our profitability. 
 Inflationary pressures and shortages in the labor market have increased, and could continue to increase, our labor costs, which could negatively impact our profitability. With approximately 420 employees as of November 1, 2023, our profitability may be substantially affected by costs of medical and other health and welfare benefits for these employees. Although we try to control these costs, they can vary because of changes in healthcare laws and claims experience, which have the potential to increase the cost of providing medical and other employee health and welfare benefits. Any substantial increase could negatively affect our profitability. 
 If we are unable to continue to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned, and the price of our common stock could suffer. 
 Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 SOX requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue an opinion on its audit of our internal control over financial reporting. 
 The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the deadlines imposed by SOX and SEC rules. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken and the price of our common stock may suffer. In addition, in the event we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we might fail to timely prevent or detect potential financial misstatements. As of September 30, 2023, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

 Actions of stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management s attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business. 
 We may, from time to time, be subject to proposals and other requests from stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions, including proposals seeking to influence our corporate policies or effect a change in our management. In the event of such stockholder proposals, particularly with respect to matters which our management and Board of Directors, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to actions and requests of stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners and customers.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of BellRing Brands, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Distribution, LLC) BellRing and its consolidated subsidiaries. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements under Item 8 of this report and the Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements on page 1. 
 The following should be read in conjunction with the discussion and analysis of our fiscal 2022 results compared to our fiscal 2021 results, including any related discussion of fiscal 2021 results and activity, which can be found in Item 7 of Part II under the title Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, and such discussion and analysis is incorporated by reference herein. 
 OVERVIEW 
 On October 21, 2019, BellRing Intermediate Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Brands, Inc.) Old BellRing closed its initial public offering (the IPO of 39.4 million shares of its Class A common stock, 0.01 par value per share Old BellRing Class A Common Stock and contributed the net proceeds from the IPO to BellRing Brands, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and subsidiary of Old BellRing BellRing LLC ), in exchange for 39.4 million BellRing LLC non-voting membership units (the BellRing LLC units ). As a result of the IPO and certain other transactions completed in connection with the IPO (the formation transactions ), BellRing LLC became the holding company for the active nutrition business of Post Holdings, Inc. Post ). Old BellRing, as a holding company, had no material assets other than its ownership of BellRing LLC units and its indirect interests in the subsidiaries of BellRing LLC and had no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow. The members of BellRing LLC were Post and Old BellRing. 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, Post completed its distribution of 80.1 of its ownership interest in BellRing to Post s shareholders. On March 9, 2022, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 26, 2021 (as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 28, 2022, the Transaction Agreement ), by and among Post, Old BellRing, BellRing and BellRing Merger Sub Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing BellRing Merger Sub ), Post contributed its share of Old BellRing Class B common stock, 0.01 par value per share Old BellRing Class B Common Stock ), all of its BellRing LLC units and 550.4 million of cash to BellRing (collectively, the Contribution in exchange for certain limited liability company interests of BellRing (prior to the conversion of BellRing into a Delaware corporation) and the right to receive 840.0 million in aggregate principal amount of BellRing s 7.00 senior notes maturing in 2030 (the 7.00 Senior Notes ). 
 On March 10, 2022, BellRing converted into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to BellRing Brands, Inc. , and Post distributed an aggregate of 78.1 million, or 80.1 , of its shares of BellRing common stock, 0.01 par value per share BellRing Common Stock to Post shareholders in a pro-rata distribution (the Distribution ). 
 Upon completion of the Distribution, BellRing Merger Sub merged with and into Old BellRing (the Merger ), with Old BellRing continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing. Pursuant to the Merger, each outstanding share of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock was converted into one share of BellRing Common Stock plus 2.97 in cash, or 115.5 million total consideration paid t o Old BellRing Class A common stockholders pursuant to the Merger . As a result of the transactions described above (collectively, the Spin-off ), BellRing became the new public parent company of, and successor issuer to, Old BellRing, and shares of BellRing Common Stock were deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated thereunder. 
 Immediately prior to the Spin-off, Post held 97.5 million BellRing LLC units, equal to 71.5 of the economic interest in BellRing LLC, and one share of Old BellRing Class B Common Stock, which represented 67 of the combined voting power of the common stock of Old BellRing. 
 Immediately following the Spin-off, Post owned 19.4 million shares, or 14.2 , of BellRing Common Stock, which did not represent a controlling interest in BellRing. As a result of the Spin-off, the dual class voting structure in the BellRing business was eliminated. 
 On August 11, 2022, Post transferred 14.8 million shares of its BellRing Common Stock to certain financial institutions in satisfaction of term loan obligations of Post, which reduced Post s ownership of BellRing Common Stock to 3.4 as of September 30, 2022. In connection with this transaction, BellRing repurchased 0.8 million of the transferred shares from certain of the financial institutions.

Table of Contents 

 On November 25, 2022, Post transferred its remaining 4.6 million shares of BellRing Common Stock to certain financial institutions in satisfaction of term loan obligations of Post. In connection with this transaction, BellRing repurchased 0.9 million of the transferred shares from certain of the financial institutions. Post had no ownership of BellRing Common Stock as of September 30, 2023. 
 BellRing incurred separation-related expenses in connection with its separation from Post of 0.7 million and 14.5 million during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These expenses generally included third-party costs for advisory services, fees charged by other service providers and government filing fees and were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 The terms BellRing, we, our, us, the Company or our Company generally refer to Old BellRing and its consolidated subsidiaries during the periods prior to the Spin-off and to us and our consolidated subsidiaries during the periods subsequent to the Spin-off unless otherwise stated or context otherwise indicates. The term Common Stock generally refers to Old BellRing Class A Common Stock and Old BellRing Class B Common Stock during the periods prior to the Spin-off and to BellRing Common Stock during the periods subsequent to the Spin-off. The term Net earnings available to common stockholders generally refers to net earnings available to Old BellRing Class A common stockholders during the periods prior to the Spin-off and to net earnings available to BellRing common stockholders during the periods subsequent to the Spin-off. 
 We are a consumer products holding company operating in the global convenient nutrition category and are a provider of ready-to-drink RTD protein shakes, other RTD beverages and powders. We have a single operating and reportable segment, with our principal products being protein-based consumer goods. Our primary brands are Premier Protein and Dymatize. 
 Industry Company Trends 
 The success of companies in the convenient nutrition category is driven by how well such companies can grow, develop and differentiate their brands. We expect the convergence of several factors to support the continued growth of the convenient nutrition category, including: 
 consumers increasingly dedicated pursuit of active lifestyles and growing interest in nutrition and wellness; 
 growing awareness of the numerous health benefits of protein, including sustained energy, muscle recovery and satiety; and 
 a rise in snacking and the desire for products that can be consumed on-the-go as nutritious snacks or meal replacements. 
 Nonetheless, the consumer food and beverage industry faces a number of challenges and uncertainties, including: 
 the highly competitive nature of the industry, which involves competition from a host of nutritional food and beverage companies, including manufacturers of other branded food and beverage products as well as manufacturers of private label and store brand products; 
 changing consumer preferences which require food manufacturers to identify changing preferences and to offer products that appeal to consumers; 
 supply chain challenges, including labor shortages and equipment delays, which have delayed capacity expansion across the broader third-party aseptic processing contract manufacturer network and are expected to continue into fiscal 2024; and 
 inflationary pressures (see Market Trends below for information). 
 Seasonality 
 We have experienced in the past, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our sales and operating profit margins because of customer spending patterns and timing of our key retailers promotional activity. Historically, our first fiscal quarter is seasonally low for all brands driven by a slowdown of consumption of our products during the holiday season. Sales are typically higher throughout the remainder of the fiscal year as a result of promotional activity at key retailers as well as organic growth of the business. 
 Market Trends 
 During fiscal 2023 and 2022, input cost inflation, including raw material, packaging and manufacturing costs, impacted our supply chain and put downward pressure on profit margins. As a result, we have taken pricing actions on nearly all products. We expect inflationary pressures on protein costs to ease in fiscal 2024, while other costs, such as packaging and manufacturing, to continue to face inflationary pressures in fiscal 2024. Inflation could have a materially adverse impact on our business in the future if inflation rates were to significantly exceed our ability to achieve price increases or cost savings or if such price increases impact demand for our products.

 Items Affecting Comparability 
 During the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, net sales and/or operating profit were impacted by the following items: 
 accelerated amortization expense of 7.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 related to the discontinuance of the PowerBar business in North America; 
 separation-related expenses in connection with our separation from Post of 0.7 million and 14.5 million for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively; and 
 5.0 million and 8.0 million of expense for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to provisions for legal matters. For additional information, refer to Note 14 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 For further discussion, refer to Results of Operations within this section.

 Net Sales 
 Net sales increased 295.3 million, or 22 , during the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the prior year. Sales of Premier Protein products were up 275.7 million, or 25 , on 11 higher volumes. Average net selling prices increased in the year ended September 30, 2023 due to targeted price increases taken to mitigate inflation. Volumes increased due to higher production, distribution gains and the reintroduction of certain RTD shake flavors. Sales of Dymatize products were up 22.8 million, or 11 , primarily driven by higher average net selling prices. Average net selling prices increased in the year ended September 30, 2023 due to targeted price increases, partially offset by increased promotional spending. In addition, Dymatize volumes increased 4 primarily driven by distribution gains. Sales of all other products were down 3.2 million. 
 Operating Profit 
 Operating profit increased 74.9 million, or 35 , during the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales, as previously discussed, and 13.8 million of lower costs related to the separation from Post. These positive impacts were partially offset by higher net product costs of 87.3 million primarily driven by unfavorable raw material and manufacturing costs, slightly offset by lower freight costs. In addition, we incurred the following higher expenses; (i) advertising expenses of 18.3 million, (ii) employee-related expenses of 9.2 million, (iii) professional fees of 8.3 million, and (iv) accelerated amortization expense of 7.1 million related to the discontinuance of the PowerBar business in North America. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net increased 17.7 million during the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher average outstanding principal amounts of debt, primarily resulting from the Spin-off, and a higher weighted-average interest rate compared to the prior year. The weighted-average interest rate on our total outstanding debt increased to 7.2 for the year ended September 30, 2023 from 6.2 for the year ended September 30, 2022, primarily driven by the issuance of our 7.00 Senior Notes during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. See Note 13 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt.

 Loss on Extinguishment and Refinancing of Debt, Net 
 During the year ended September 30, 2022, we recognized a 17.6 million loss related t o the termination of our Old Credit Agreement (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources . This loss included (i) a 6.9 million write-off of unamortized discounts and debt extinguishment fees, (ii) a 6.1 million write-off of unamortized net hedging losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to the Term B Facility (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources and (iii) a 4.6 million write-off of debt issuance costs and deferred financing fees. See Note 13 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 24.9 compared to 20.3 for fiscal 2022. The following table presents the reconciliation of income tax expense with amounts computed at the United States U.S. federal statutory tax rate. 
 Year Ended September 30, dollars in millions 2023 2022 Computed tax at federal statutory rate (21 46.3 30.6 Income tax expense attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest (7.6) State income taxes, net of effect on federal tax 8.4 4.7 Transaction costs 2.0 Other, net (none in excess of 5 of computed tax) 0.2 (0.1) Income tax expense 54.9 29.6 
 The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year was primarily due to us reporting 100 of the income, gain, loss and deduction of BellRing LLC in the periods subsequent to the Spin-off, partially offset by higher separation-related expenses incurred in connection with the Spin-off in the prior year that were treated as non-deductible. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 On March 10, 2022, in connection with the Transaction Agreement, we issued the 7.00 Senior Notes to Post as partial non-cash consideration for the Contribution in connection with the Distribution. Post subsequently delivered the 7.00 Senior Notes to certain financial institutions in satisfaction of term loan obligations of Post in an equal principal amount. 
 On March 10, 2022, in connection with the Transaction Agreement, we entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement ), which provides for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 250.0 million (the Revolving Credit Facility ), with commitments to be made available to us in U.S. Dollars, Euros and United Kingdom Pounds Sterling. The outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement must be repaid on or before March 10, 2027. 
 Prior to the Transaction Agreement, BellRing LLC had entered into a credit agreement on October 21, 2019 (as subsequently amended, the Old Credit Agreement which provided for debt facilities consisting of a 700.0 million term B loan facility (the Term B Facility and a 200.0 million revolving credit facility (the Old Revolving Credit Facility ). On March 10, 2022, with certain of the proceeds from the debt financing transactions described above, BellRing LLC repaid the aggregate outstanding principal balance of 519.8 million on the Term B Facility and terminated all obligations and commitments under the Old Credit Agreement. 
 During the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we borrowed 115.0 million and 164.0 million, respectively, under the Revolving Credit Facility and repaid 189.0 million and 65.0 million, respectively, under the Revolving Credit Facility. We had 225.0 million and 151.0 million of borrowing capacity as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were no outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2023 or 2022. Subsequent to September 30, 2023, we repaid an additional 25.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, which reduced the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility to zero. 
 Letters of credit are available under the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of up to 20.0 million. The Credit Agreement provides for potential incremental revolving and term facilities at the Company s request and at the discretion of the lenders or other persons providing such incremental facilities, in each case on terms to be determined, and also permits the Company to incur other secured or unsecured debt, in all cases subject to conditions and limitations on the amount as specified in the Credit Agreement. 
 During the year ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 4.2 million shares of BellRing Common Stock at an average share price of 29.56 per share and at a total cost, including accrued excise tax and broker s commissions, of 126.3 million.

Table of Contents 

 During the year ended September 30, 2022 , prior to the Spin-Off, we repurchas ed 0.8 million shares of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock at an average share price of 23.34 per share and at a total cost, including broker s commissions, of 18.1 million. In connection with the Spin-off, 0.8 million shares of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock held in treasury stock immediately prior to the Merger effective time were cancelled pursuant to the Transaction Agreement. During the year ended September 30, 2022, subsequent to the Spin-off, we repurchas ed 1.1 million shares of BellRing Common Stock at an average share price of 23.17 per share and at a total cost, including broker s commissions, of 24.7 million. 
 For additional information on the Spin-off, Credit Agreement and share repurchases, see Notes 1, 13 and 16 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 We expect to generate positive cash flows from operations and believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and possible future credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital requirements, purchase commitments, research and development activities, debt repayments (including interest payments), share repurchases and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact meeting our capital needs during or beyond the next twelve months. Our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions, competitive pressures and other business risk factors. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and cash on hand to satisfy our cash needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or otherwise to comply with the terms of our credit facilities, we may be required to seek additional financing alternatives. 
 Short-term financing needs primarily consist of working capital requirements and interest payments on our 7.00 Senior Notes and Revolving Credit Facility. Long-term financing needs include the repayment of our 7.00 Senior Notes and Revolving Credit Facility. Additional long-term financing needs will depend largely on potential growth opportunities, including acquisition activity and other strategic transactions. Our asset-light business model requires modest capital expenditures, with annual capital expenditures over the last three fiscal years averaging less than 1 of net sales. No significant capital expenditures are planned for fiscal 2024. Additionally, we may seek to repurchase shares of our Common Stock. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 Cash Requirements 
 Our cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include: 
 Debt Obligations and Interest Payments See Note 13 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt and the timing of expected future principal and interest payments. 
 Operating Leases See Note 11 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our operating leases and the timing of expected future payments. 
 Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations are legally binding agreements to purchase goods, services or equipment that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and/or penalties imposed for failing to meet contracted minimum purchase quantities (such as take-or-pay contracts); fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had total purchase commitments of 1,487.7 million (with 459.6 million due in fiscal 2024) which extend through fiscal 2033. 
 Other liabilities Other liabilities include obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, provisions for legal matters, unrecognized tax benefits and various other long-term liabilities, all of which have some inherent uncertainty as to the amount and timing of payments and were reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023.

 The following table presents select cash flow data, which is discussed below. 
 Year Ended September 30, dollars in millions 2023 2022 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities

 (1.8) (1.8) Financing activities 
 (201.7) (135.0) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 
 0.5 (1.0) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 12.6 (116.8) 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2023 increased 194.6 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to lapping larger cash outflows in the prior year related to the rebuild of powder finished goods from previous supply-constrained levels, partially offset by input cost inflation. The increase was incrementally driven by higher net earnings and favorable changes related to fluctuations in the timing of sales and collections of trade receivables. These positive impacts were partially offset by increased tax payments (net of refunds) of 26.3 million and increased interest payments of 21.6 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities for both the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was 1.8 million and related to capital expenditures in each year. 
 Financing Activities 
 Fiscal 2023 
 Cash used in financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2023 was 201.7 million. We paid 125.5 million, including broker s commissions, for the repurchase of Common Stock and borrowed and repaid 115.0 million and 189.0 million, respectively, under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Fiscal 2022 
 Cash used in financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2022 was 135.0 million. We repaid the outstanding principal balance of the Term B Facility of 609.9 million, repaid 65.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and paid 115.5 million to Old BellRing Class A common stockholders pursuant to the Merger. In addition, we paid 11.9 million of debt issuance costs, debt extinguishment costs and deferred financing fees related to the issuance of the 7.00 Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, and we paid 42.8 million, including broker s commissions, for the repurchase of Common Stock. We received 550.4 million of cash from Post in connection with the Spin-off, which was partially offset by cash distributions to Post of 3.2 million related to quarterly tax distributions pursuant to BellRing LLC s amended and restated limited liability company agreement prior to the Spin-off. Additionally, we borrowed 164.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Debt Covenants 
 The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us and our restricted subsidiaries customary for agreements of this type, including delivery of financial and other information; compliance with laws; maintenance of property; existence; insurance; books and records; inspection rights; obligation to provide collateral and guarantees by certain new subsidiaries; delivery of environmental reports; participation in an annual meeting with the agent and the lenders; further assurances; and limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, restrictive agreements, use of proceeds, amendments of organization documents, prepayments and amendments of certain indebtedness, dispositions of assets, acquisitions and other investments, sale leaseback transactions, changes in the nature of business, transactions with affiliates and dividends and redemptions or repurchases of stock. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we are also required to comply with a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a total net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) not to exceed 6.00:1.00, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. We were in compliance with the financial covenant as of September 30, 2023 , and we do not believe non-compliance is reasonably likely in the foreseeable future. 
 The Credit Agreement provides for potential incremental revolving and term facilities at our request and at the discretion of the lenders or other persons providing such incremental facilities, in each case on terms to be determined, and also permits us to incur other secured or unsecured debt, in all cases subject to conditions and limitations on the amount as specified in the Credit Agreement.

Table of Contents 

 In addition, the indenture governing the 7.00 Senior Notes contains negative covenants customary for this type of agreement that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: borrow money or guarantee debt; create liens; pay dividends on, or redeem or repurchase, stock; make specified types of investments and acquisitions; enter into or permit to exist contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; enter into transactions with affiliates; and sell assets or merge with other companies. Certain of these covenants are subject to suspension when and if the 7.00 Senior Notes receive investment grade ratings. 
 
 COMMODITY TRENDS 
 We are exposed to price fluctuations primarily from purchases of ingredients and packaging materials, energy and other inputs. Our principal ingredients are milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins, protein blends, sweeteners and vitamin and mineral blends. Our principal packaging materials consist of aseptic foil and plastic lined cardboard cartons, flexible and rigid plastic film and containers, beverage packaging and corrugate. These costs have been volatile in recent years, and future changes in such costs may cause our results of operations and our operating margins to fluctuate significantly. We manage the impact of cost increases, wherever possible, on commercially reasonable terms, by locking in prices on the quantities through purchase commitments required to meet our production requirements. In addition, we may attempt to offset the effect of increased costs by raising prices to our customers. However, for competitive reasons, we may not be able to pass along the full effect of increases in raw materials and other input costs as we incur them. See Market Trends section above for additional information regarding inflationary pressures on our commodity purchases. 
 CURRENCY 
 Certain sales and costs of our foreign operations are denominated in Euros. Consequently, profits from these operations are impacted by fluctuations in the value of this currency relative to the U.S. Dollar. We incur gains and losses within our stockholders equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars. Our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign operations into U.S. Dollars. The exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. Dollars positively affected net sales by less than 1 during the year ended September 30, 2023, and did not have a material impact on our operating profit or net earnings during the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires the use of judgment, estimates and assumptions. We make these subjective determinations after considering our historical performance, management s experience, current economic trends and events and information from outside sources. Inherent in this process is the possibility that actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions for any particular period. 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our critical accounting estimates are those that involve a significant amount of estimation uncertainty and have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Revenue Recognition, Allowance for Trade Promotions The recognition of certain variable trade promotions, which are treated as a reduction of revenue, requires significant management judgment regarding estimated purchase volumes and program participation. Estimates are based on contractual provisions, redemption rate assumptions and our assessment of current market provisions. Redemption rate assumptions are based on historical results of similar promotions on a deal-by-deal basis, adjusted for current expectations of promotion performance based on the current market. We review and update estimates of variable consideration quarterly. Uncertainties related to the estimates of variable consideration are resolved in a short time frame and do not require any additional constraint on variable consideration. Less than 1 of our annual net sales represent variable consideration that will be resolved in the subsequent period. Based on historical experience, we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration when any uncertainties are resolved with customers. However, significant changes in our estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 We considered all new accounting pronouncements and have concluded there are no new pronouncements that had or will have a material impact on our results of operations, comprehensive income, financial condition, cash flows, shareholders equity or related disclosures based on current information.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The Company is exposed to market risk from commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, among others. For additional discussion of these risks, refer to Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements on page 1 and Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this report. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to commodity price risks relating to the purchases of raw materials. The Company manages the impact of cost increases, wherever possible, on commercially reasonable terms, by locking in prices on the quantities through purchase commitments required to meet production requirements. In addition, the Company may attempt to offset the effect of increased costs by raising prices to customers. However, for competitive reasons, the Company may not be able to pass along the full effect of increases in raw materials and other input costs as they are incurred. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Related to Active Nutrition International GmbH, whose functional currency is the Euro, the Company is exposed to risks of fluctuations in future cash flows and earnings due to changes in exchange rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of both September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had outstanding principal value indebtedness of 840.0 million related to its 7.00 Senior Notes. Additionally, the Company had an aggregate principal amount of 25.0 million and 99.0 million outstanding under its Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates. 
 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of the Company s debt, excluding any borrowings under its Revolving Credit Facility, was 830.0 million and 767.4 million, respectively. Changes in interest rates impact fixed and variable rate debt differently. For fixed rate debt, a change in interest rates will only impact the fair value of the debt, whereas a change in the interest rates on variable rate debt will impact interest expense and cash flows. A hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the fixed rate debt by approximately 19 million and 17 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. A hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates would have had an immaterial impact on both interest expense and interest paid during both the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. For additional information regarding the Company s debt, see Note 13 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BellRing Brands, Inc. 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BellRing Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders' deficit and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Receivables, net- Allowance for Trade Promotions 
 As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, many of the Company's contracts with customers include some form of variable or fixed consideration. The most common forms of variable and fixed consideration are trade promotions, rebates and discount programs. These programs resulted in an allowance for trade promotions of million which is reflected as a reduction of Receivables, net as of September 30, 2023. Variable consideration is treated as a reduction of revenue at the time product revenue is recognized. Methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on specific customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. The Company reviews and updates estimates of variable consideration each period. Uncertainties related to the estimates of variable consideration are resolved in a short time frame and do not require any additional constraint on variable consideration. 
 The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to receivables, net - allowance for trade promotions is a critical audit matter is the matter involved significant audit effort in performing procedures related to management s allowance for trade promotions. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the accuracy and valuation of the allowance for trade promotions. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management s process for determining the allowance for trade promotions; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology; and (iii) testing the accuracy and relevance of underlying data used to determine the allowance for trade promotions by examining customer agreements and sales data on a test basis.

Variable consideration is treated as a reduction of revenue at the time product revenue is recognized. Methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on specific customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. The Company does not believe that there will be significant changes to its estimates of variable consideration when any uncertainties are resolved with customers. The Company reviews and updates estimates of variable consideration each period. Uncertainties related to the estimates of variable consideration are resolved in a short time frame and do not require any additional constraint on variable consideration. The majority of trade promotions are redeemed in the form of invoice credits against trade receivables.

 The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2023 was compared to for fiscal 2022 and for fiscal 2021. The increase in the effective income tax rate compared to fiscal 2022 and 2021 was primarily due to the change in tax expense allocation related to the Spin-off.

The other eight Related Federal Actions remain pending, and the court has certified individual state classes in each of those cases (except New Mexico). 
 In April 2018, the district court dismissed the California Federal Class Lawsuit with prejudice. This dismissal was upheld on appeal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2020, and plaintiff s petition for an en banc rehearing by the Ninth Circuit was denied. 
 In September 2020, the same lead counsel re-filed the California Federal Class Lawsuit against Premier Nutrition in California Superior Court for the County of Alameda, alleging identical claims and seeking restitution and injunctive relief on behalf of the same putative class of California consumers as the California Federal Class Lawsuit. Following the federal district court s denial of Premier Nutrition s motion to permanently enjoin the Alameda action under the doctrine of res judicata , Premier Nutrition appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the district court decision. In March 2023, the Alameda Superior Court granted in part and denied in part Premier Nutrition s motion for judgment based on res judicata and in May 2023, the Court reaffirmed its ruling. In July 2023, Premier Nutrition filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the California Court of Appeal, which writ is pending. In July 2023, Plaintiff moved to certify the case as a class action, which remains pending. This case was previously set for trial in September 2023, together with Alameda County case set forth in the immediately succeeding paragraph, but the court separated them. Trial is anticipated in calendar year 2024. 
 In January 2019, the same lead counsel filed an additional class action complaint against Premier Nutrition in California Superior Court for the County of Alameda, alleging claims similar to the above actions and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a putative class of California consumers, beginning after the California Federal Class Lawsuit class period. In July 2020, the court issued an order certifying a statewide class. Premier Nutrition moved for summary judgment on July 7, 2023, which motion remains pending. This case was set for trial in September 2023, but has been rescheduled to begin on December 15, 2023. 
 The Company continues to vigorously defend these cases and intends to appeal any adverse judgements and awards of damages. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these cases will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 As of September 30, 2023, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based upon the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on management s assessment utilizing these criteria, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report, which appears herein. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Based on management s evaluation, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 REGISTERED SECURITIES

Document 

Exhibit 4.3 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF BELLRING BRANDS, INC. S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 
 
 The following is a brief description of the registered securities of BellRing Brands, Inc. (the Company, BellRing, we, us or our ). This description is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of our certificate of incorporation (the certificate of incorporation filed as Exhibit 3.1 to our Form 8-K12B filed on March 10, 2022 and incorporated herein by reference, and to the full text of our bylaws (the bylaws filed as Exhibit 3.2 to our Form 8-K12B filed on March 10, 2022 and incorporated herein by reference. 
 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK 
 General 
 Under our certificate of incorporation, we may issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, and up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol BRBR . 
 Common Stock 
 Voting Rights . The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held by such holder on the applicable record date on all matters on which stockholders are generally entitled to vote. 
 Dividends . The holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared by our board of directors out of legally available funds. 
 Liquidation or Dissolution . Upon our liquidation or dissolution, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in those of our assets that are legally available for distribution to stockholders after payment of liabilities and subject to the special rights and preferences, if any, of any holders of our preferred stock then outstanding. 
 Other Rights . There are no preemptive rights, redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our common stock, and the outstanding shares of our common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. 
 Limitations of Rights of Holders of Common Stock - Preferred Stock 
 The rights of holders of our common stock may be materially limited or qualified by the rights, powers and preferences of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future. 
 Our board of directors is authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, to determine the terms and conditions of the preferred stock, including whether the shares of preferred stock will be issued in one or more series, the number of shares to be included in each series and the powers (including voting powers), designations, preferences and rights of the shares. Our board of directors also is authorized to designate any qualifications, limitations or restrictions on the shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders, subject to applicable rules of the NYSE and Delaware law. 
 Authorizing our board of directors to establish preferred stock eliminates delays associated with seeking stockholder approval of the creation of a particular class or series of preferred stock. The rights of the holders of our common stock are subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of our preferred stock issued at any time, including in the future. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock, which could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. These provisions also could make it more difficult for our stockholders to effect certain corporate actions, including the election of directors. 

Corporate Opportunities 
 The General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL permits the adoption of a provision in a corporation s certificate of incorporation renouncing any interests or expectancy of a corporation in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, specified business opportunities or specified classes or categories of business opportunities that are presented to the corporation or to one or more of its directors, officers or stockholders. 
 Our certificate of incorporation includes certain provisions regulating and defining the conduct of our affairs to the extent that they may involve Post Holdings, Inc. Post and its directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates (except that we and our subsidiaries are not deemed affiliates of Post or its affiliates for purposes of these provisions) and our rights, powers, duties and liabilities and those of our directors, officers, managers, employees and agents in connection with our relationship with Post. In general, and except as may be set forth in any agreement between us and Post, these provisions provide that Post and its affiliates may carry on and conduct any business of any kind, nature or description, whether or not such business is competitive with or in the same or similar lines of business as us Post and its affiliates may do business with any of our customers, vendors and lessors and Post and its affiliates may make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments. In addition, these provisions provide that we renounce any interest or expectancy to participate in any business of Post or its affiliates. 
 Moreover, our certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce any interests or expectancy in corporate opportunities which become known to (i) any of our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents who also are directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates of Post or its affiliates (except that we and our subsidiaries are not deemed affiliates of Post or its affiliates for the purposes of the provision) or (ii) Post or its affiliates. The provision generally provides that neither Post nor our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents who also are directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates of Post or its affiliates will be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact that any such person pursues or acquires any corporate opportunity for the account of Post or its affiliates, directs, recommends or transfers such corporate opportunity to Post or its affiliates or does not offer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us or any person controlled by us because such person has directed or intends to direct such opportunity to Post or one of its affiliates. This renunciation does not extend to corporate opportunities expressly offered to one of our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents, solely in his or her capacity as our director, officer, manager, employee or agent. 
 These provisions in our certificate of incorporation cease to apply at such time as none of the directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates of Post serve as our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents. 
 Anti-Takeover Effects of Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors and which may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a future takeover or change in control unless such takeover or change in control is approved by our board of directors. These provisions include 
 No Special Meetings Called by Stockholders . Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that stockholder action can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and cannot be taken by any consent in lieu of a meeting. Our bylaws also provide that, except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of the stockholders can only be called by the affirmative vote of a majority of our entire board of directors, the chairperson of the board of directors or our president. Except as described above, stockholders are not permitted to call a special meeting or to require the board of directors to call a special meeting. 
 Advance Notice Procedures . Our bylaws contain provisions requiring that advance notice be delivered to us of any business to be brought by a stockholder before an annual meeting and providing for procedures to be followed by stockholders in nominating persons for election to our board of directors. Ordinarily, the stockholder must give notice in writing to our Secretary not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the date of the first anniversary of the prior year s annual meeting except that, in the event that the date of the meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be received not earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement 

of the date of the annual meeting is first made. For stockholder proposals, the notice must include a description of the proposal, the reasons for the proposal and other specified matters. Our board of directors may reject any proposals or nominations that have not followed these procedures or that are not a proper subject for stockholder action in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. Although our bylaws do not otherwise give the board of directors the power to approve or disapprove stockholder nominations of candidates or proposals regarding other business to be conducted at a special or annual meeting, our bylaws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business or the nomination of certain individuals at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed or may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. 
 Directors, and Not Stockholders, Fix the Size of Our Board of Directors . Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the number of directors will be fixed from time to time exclusively pursuant to a resolution adopted by our board of directors, but in no event will it consist of less than five nor more than twelve directors. 
 Vacancies and Newly-Created Directorships on Our Board of Directors. Subject to the special rights of holders of any outstanding series of our preferred stock, any vacancy on our board of directors occurring for any reason, and any newly created directorships which occur by reason of an increase in the number of directors, will be filled only by the majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum or by a sole remaining director. These provisions could make it more difficult for our stockholders to affect the composition of the board of directors. 
 Classified Board of Directors Removal of Directors . Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms. The number of directors assigned to each class is as equal as reasonably possible. Each class will hold office until the third annual stockholders meeting for election of directors following the most recent election of such class and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. With only a portion of our board of directors up for election each year, the existence of a classified board of directors could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us because it would take more than one annual meeting to do so. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that our directors may only be removed for cause, which could also make it more difficult to change the composition of our board of directors. 
 Authorized but Unissued Shares . Our authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval, subject to applicable rules of the NYSE and Delaware law. These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings or private offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans and equity grants. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of a majority of our common stock by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. We do not intend to solicit approval of stockholders for issuance of authorized but unissued shares of our common stock and preferred stock, unless our board of directors believes that approval is advisable or is required by applicable rules of the NYSE or Delaware law. 
 Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 The DGCL generally provides that a corporation may amend its certificate of incorporation upon a resolution of its board of directors proposing the amendment and its submission to the stockholders for their approval upon the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power entitled to vote thereon. Our certificate of incorporation provides that it may be amended in accordance with and upon the vote prescribed by Delaware law, except that the indemnification provisions of the certificate of incorporation may be amended (or a provision inconsistent with the indemnification provisions adopted) only upon the affirmative vote of not less than 85 of all of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of our common stock then entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. 
 The DGCL provides that the power to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws of a corporation is held by the stockholders of the corporation, except that a corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal its bylaws upon the board of directors of the corporation, but the fact that such power has been so conferred upon the board of directors will not divest the stockholders of such power or limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that our board of directors may amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of the bylaws. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws also 

provide that stockholders may amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of the bylaws upon the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the voting power entitled to vote thereon. 
 Directors Liability Indemnification of Directors and Officers 
 The DGCL permits a corporation, in its certificate of incorporation, to limit or eliminate, subject to certain statutory limitations, the liability of directors to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duty, except for liability 
 for any breach of the director s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders 
 for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law 
 in respect of certain unlawful dividend payments or stock redemptions or repurchases and 
 for any transaction from which a director derives an improper personal benefit. 
 The DGCL permits a corporation, under specified circumstances, to indemnify its directors, officers, employees and agents against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlements actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with any action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that they were or are directors, officers, employees or agents of the corporation, if such directors, officers, employees or agents acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reason to believe their conduct was unlawful. In a derivative action or suit (i.e., one by or in the right of the corporation), indemnification may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred by directors, officers, employees and agents in connection with the defense or settlement of an action or suit, and only with respect to a matter as to which they have acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification will be made if such person has been adjudged liable to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action or suit was brought determines upon application that the defendant directors, officers, employees or agents are fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses despite such adjudication of liability. 
 The DGCL also permits corporations to advance expenses incurred by an officer or director of the corporation in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation. 
 Our certificate of incorporation limits the liability of directors to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and provides that we will provide our directors and officers with customary indemnification and advancement. We have entered into customary indemnification agreements with each of our directors and certain of our executive officers that provide them, in general, with customary indemnification and advancement in connection with their service to us or on our behalf. 
 Exclusive Forum 
 The DGCL permits a corporation to require, and not prohibit, in its certificate of incorporation or bylaws, internal corporate claims to be brought (only) in Delaware. Under Section 115 of the DGCL, internal corporate claims means claims, including claims in the right of the corporation, (i) that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director or officer or stockholder in such capacity or (ii) as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery. 
 Section 12 of our certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the State of Delaware) is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law 
 any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf 
 any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty 

any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL and 
 any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. 
 Section 12 does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that U.S. federal courts will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action or proceeding arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Further, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in our common stock will be deemed to have notice of Section 12 of our certificate of incorporation. 
 Although our certificate of incorporation contains the exclusive forum provision described above, it is possible that a court could find that such a provision is inapplicable for a particular claim or action or that such provision is unenforceable. The exclusive forum provision does not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.

If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement or otherwise to indemnification by the Company for a portion of the Expenses, liabilities, losses, judgments, fines, penalties, costs and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such liabilities, losses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement) incurred by Indemnitee or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, in whole or in part, the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent to which Indemnitee is entitled to such indemnification. 
 (b) Contribution .

 - 2 - 

(iii) The Company hereby agrees to fully indemnify and hold Indemnitee harmless from any claims of contribution that may be brought by officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who may be jointly liable with Indemnitee. 
 (iv) To the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law and without diminishing or impairing the obligations of the Company set forth in the preceding subsections of this Section 6 , if the indemnification obligations of the Company provided for in this Agreement are unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee, whether for liabilities, losses, judgments, fines, penalties, costs, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and or for Expenses, in connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding in order to reflect (A) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and or transaction(s) giving cause to such Proceeding and or (B) the relative fault of the Company (and its directors, officers, employees and agents) and Indemnitee in connection with such event(s) and or transaction(s). 
 7. Indemnification for Additional Expenses Incurred to Secure Recovery or as Witness . 
 (a) The Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, indemnify Indemnitee with respect to, and hold Indemnitee harmless from and against, any and all Expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall advance on an as-incurred basis (as provided in Section 9 of this Agreement) such Expenses to Indemnitee, which are reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action or proceeding or part thereof brought by Indemnitee for (i) indemnification or advance payment of Expenses by the Company under this Agreement, any other agreement or the Organizational Documents of the Company as now or hereafter in effect or (ii) recovery under any director and officer liability insurance policies maintained by any Company Entity. 
 (b) To the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, a witness (or is forced or asked to respond to discovery requests) in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party, the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, indemnify Indemnitee with respect to, and hold Indemnitee harmless from and against, and the Company will advance on an as-incurred basis (as provided in Section 9 of this Agreement), all Expenses reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith.

The only limitation that shall exist upon the Company s obligations pursuant to this Agreement shall be that the Company shall not be obligated to make any payment to Indemnitee if a court of competent jurisdiction issues a final non-appealable judicial determination that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder. 
 9. Advancement of Expenses . The Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, pay on a current and as-incurred basis all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding in any way connected with, resulting from or relating to Indemnitee s Corporate Status. Such Expenses shall be paid in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, without regard to whether Indemnitee will ultimately be entitled to be indemnified for such Expenses and without regard to whether an Adverse Determination has been or may be made, except as contemplated by Section 10(f) of this Agreement. Following a final disposition of such Proceeding, if any, Indemnitee shall repay such amounts advanced only if and to the extent that an Adverse Determination is made and not challenged, as provided in Section 10(f) , or if it shall ultimately be determined in a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal can be taken that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company for such Expenses. 
 10. Indemnification Procedures . 
 (a) Notice of Proceeding . Indemnitee agrees to notify the Company promptly upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to any Proceeding or matter that may be subject to indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder. Any failure by Indemnitee to notify the Company will relieve the Company of its advancement or indemnification obligations under this Agreement only to the extent the Company can establish that such omission to notify resulted in actual and material prejudice to it, and the omission to notify the Company will, in any event, not relieve the Company from any liability that it may have to indemnify Indemnitee otherwise under this Agreement. 
 (b) Defense Settlement . The Company shall have the sole right and obligation to control the defense or conduct of any claim or Proceeding with respect to Indemnitee. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, effect any settlement or compromise 
 - 3 - 

of any Proceeding against Indemnitee which imposes any cost or liability on Indemnitee unless such settlement or compromise solely involves the payment of money for which the Indemnitee will be fully indemnified or performance of any obligation by persons other than Indemnitee. The Company shall not be obligated to indemnify Indemnitee against amounts paid in settlement of a Proceeding against Indemnitee if such settlement is effected by Indemnitee without the Company s prior written consent. 
 (c) Request for Advancement Request for Indemnification . 
 (i) To obtain advancement of Expenses under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request therefor, together with such invoices or other supporting information as may be reasonably requested by the Company and reasonably available to Indemnitee, and, only to the extent required by applicable Law and or any applicable Organizational Documents that cannot be waived, an unsecured written undertaking to repay amounts advanced unless it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the Company. The Company shall make advance payment of Expenses to Indemnitee no later than 15 days after receipt of the written request for advancement (and each subsequent request for advancement) by Indemnitee. 
 (ii) To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, at any time after submission of a request for advancement of Expenses pursuant to Section 10(c)(i) of this Agreement, Indemnitee may submit a written request for indemnification hereunder. The time at which Indemnitee submits a written request for indemnification shall be determined by the Indemnitee in the Indemnitee s sole discretion. Once Indemnitee submits such a written request for indemnification (and only at such time that Indemnitee submits such a written request for indemnification), a Determination shall thereafter be made, as provided in and only to the extent required by Section 10(d) of this Agreement. In no event shall a Determination be made, or required to be made, as a condition to or otherwise in connection with any advancement of Expenses pursuant to Section 9 and Section 10(c)(i) of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure of Indemnitee to provide such a request to the Company, or to provide such a request in a timely fashion, shall not relieve the Company of any liability that it may have to Indemnitee unless, and to the extent that, such failure actually and materially prejudices the interests of the Company. 
 (d) Determination . The Company agrees that in no event shall a Determination be required in connection with indemnification for Expenses incurred as a witness pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement or incurred in connection with any Proceeding or portion thereof with respect to which Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise unless specifically required by applicable Law that cannot be waived. Any decision that a Determination is required by Law in connection with any such indemnification of Indemnitee, and any Determination required in connection therewith or with any other indemnification of Indemnitee, shall be made within 30 days after the later of (i) receipt of Indemnitee s written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 10(c)(ii) , or (ii) the selection of Independent Counsel, if such Determination is to be made by Independent Counsel (the Determination Period and such Determination shall be made either (A) by the Board of Directors by majority vote or consent of a quorum consisting of only Disinterested Directors, or (B) if such a quorum of Disinterested Directors cannot be obtained, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Company and Indemnitee. If a Determination is requested but is not made during the Determination Period, then the requisite Determination shall be deemed a Favorable Determination and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification absent (x) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (y) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable Law provided, however, that such 30-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional 15 days, if the person, persons or entity making such Determination in good faith requires such additional time to obtain or evaluate documentation and or information relating thereto. If a Determination is made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within 20 days after such Determination. Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such Determination, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information that is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and that is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such Determination. Any Independent Counsel or Disinterested Directors, as the case may be, shall act reasonably and in good faith in making a Determination under this Agreement. Any Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the Disinterested Directors or Independent Counsel, as the case may be, making such Determination shall be advanced and borne by the Company (irrespective of the Determination as to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification) and the Company is liable to indemnify and hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Determination shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of the Proceeding. 
 (e) Independent Counsel . In the event that the Determination is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 10(d) of this Agreement, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 10(e) . The Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Disinterested Directors (unless there are no Disinterested Directors, in which case Indemnitee shall select the Independent Counsel in the Indemnitee s sole discretion), and the Board of Directors or the Indemnitee, as the case may be, shall give written notice to the other, advising the Board of Directors or Indemnitee, as the case may be, of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. The Board of Directors or the Indemnitee, as the case may be, may, within 10 days after such written notice of selection shall have been received, deliver to the Indemnitee or the Board of Directors, as the case may be, a written objection to such 
 - 4 - 

selection provided , however , that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of Independent Counsel and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If a written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within 20 days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 10(c)(ii) of this Agreement, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Board of Directors or Indemnitee may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection that shall have been made by the Board of Directors or Indemnitee to the other s selection of Independent Counsel and or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the court or by such other person as the court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 10(d) of this Agreement. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 10(f) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing). Any expenses incurred by Independent Counsel shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the Determination of Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification) and not by Indemnitee. 
 (f) Consequences of Determination Remedies of Indemnitee . The Company shall be bound by and shall have no right to challenge a Favorable Determination. If an Adverse Determination is made, or if for any other reason the Company does not make timely indemnification payments or advances of Expenses, or the Company or any other person takes any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or other action or Proceeding designed to deny, or to recover from, the Indemnitee the benefits provided or intended to be provided hereunder, Indemnitee shall have the right to commence a Proceeding before a court of competent jurisdiction to challenge such Adverse Determination, and or to require the Company to make such payments or advances, and or to recover damages for breach of this Agreement, and or to recover under any directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by the Company (and the Company shall have the right to defend its position in such Proceeding and to appeal any adverse judgment in such Proceeding but shall not oppose Indemnitee s right to seek such adjudication). Indemnitee shall be entitled to be indemnified for all Expenses incurred in connection with such a Proceeding and to have such Expenses advanced by the Company in accordance with Section 9 of this Agreement, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance recovery. The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee s right to seek any such adjudication. If Indemnitee fails to challenge an Adverse Determination, or if Indemnitee challenges an Adverse Determination and such Adverse Determination has been upheld by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal can be taken, then, to the extent and only to the extent required by such Adverse Determination or final judgment, the Company shall not be obligated to indemnify or advance Expenses to Indemnitee under this Agreement. In the event that an Adverse Determination has been made, any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section 10(f) shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial on the merits, and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of the Adverse Determination. The Company authorizes the Indemnitee from time to time to retain one counsel of Indemnitee s choice reasonably acceptable to the Board of Directors, at the expense of the Company to the extent provided under applicable Law, to advise and represent Indemnitee in connection with any such judicial adjudication or recovery, including without limitation, the initiation or defense of any litigation or other legal action, whether by or against the Company or any director, officer, stockholder or other person affiliated with the Company provided that Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded based on written advice of independent counsel that there is a conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee with respect to any judicial action. The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section 10 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable. 
 (g) Presumptions Burden and Standard of Proof . The parties intend and agree that, to the extent permitted by Law, in connection with any Determination with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification hereunder by any person, including a court 
 (i) it will be presumed that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, and (A) the Company Entities or any other person or entity challenging such right will have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption, and (B) neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) to have made a Determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual Determination by the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct 
 (ii) a settlement or other disposition short of final judgment may be successful if it permits a party to avoid expense, delay, distraction, disruption and uncertainty, and therefore in the event that any action, claim or proceeding to which Indemnitee is a party is resolved in any manner other than by adverse judgment against Indemnitee (including, without limitation, settlement of such action, claim or proceeding with or without payment of money or 
 - 5 - 

other consideration) it shall be presumed that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in such action, suit or proceeding, and anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence 
 (iii) the termination of any action, suit or Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create an unfavorable presumption against Indemnitee and 
 (iv) Indemnitee will be deemed to have acted reasonably if Indemnitee s action is based on the records or books of account of the applicable Company Entity, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers, employees or committees of the board of directors (or equivalent governing body) of the applicable Company Entity, or on the advice of legal counsel for the applicable Company Entity or on information or records given in reports made to the applicable Company Entity by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert or advisor selected with reasonable care by the applicable Company Entity. 
 The provisions of this Section 10(g) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement. In addition, whether or not the foregoing provisions of this Section 10(g) are satisfied, it shall in no event create any unfavorable presumption with respect to Indemnitee s actions. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence. 
 11. Insurance Subrogation Other Rights of Recovery, etc . 
 (a) The Company may purchase and maintain a policy or policies of insurance with reputable insurance companies, providing Indemnitee with coverage for any liability asserted against, and incurred by, Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s behalf by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, or arising out of Indemnitee s status as such, whether or not any the Company would have the power to indemnify Indemnitee against such liability. With respect to the Company, such insurance policies shall have coverage terms and policy limits at least as favorable to Indemnitee as the insurance coverage provided to any other director or officer of such Company Entity. 
 (b) In the event of any payment by the Company under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee against any other Company Entity, and Indemnitee hereby agrees, as a condition to obtaining any advancement or indemnification from the Company, to assign to the Company all of Indemnitee s rights to obtain from such other Company Entity such amounts to the extent that they have been paid by the Company to or for the benefit of Indemnitee as advancement or indemnification under this Agreement and are adequate to indemnify Indemnitee with respect to the costs, Expenses or other items to the full extent that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or other payment hereunder and Indemnitee will (upon request by the Company) execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit or enforce such rights.
