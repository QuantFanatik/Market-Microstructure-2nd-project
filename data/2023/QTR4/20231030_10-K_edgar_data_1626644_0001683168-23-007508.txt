Item 1. 
 Business 

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking
statements based on expectations, estimates, and projections as of the date of this filing. Actual results may differ materially from
those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of Part I Risk Factors. 

Odyssey Health, Inc. was formed as a Nevada corporation
in March 2014. Our principal executive offices are located at 2300 West Sahara Avenue, Suite 800 - #4012, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89102. The
registration statement effectuating our initial public offering became effective in July 2015. 

Our shares of common stock are listed on the OTCQB
Marketplace OTC and there is currently very little public market for our common stock. 

As used herein, when we refer to Odyssey ,
 ODYY, the Company, our Company, we, us and our, we
mean Odyssey Health, Inc., a Nevada corporation, unless the context indicates otherwise. 

General 

Odyssey is a publicly held holding company focused
on acquiring and developing medical products. We are developing technologies that have a technological advantage, superior clinical utility,
and a substantial market opportunity within significant target markets across the globe. The corporate mission is to create or acquire
distinct technologies and intellectual property with an emphasis on acquisition targets that will generate positive cash flow. Our leadership
team has significant experience and capabilities to commercialize our technologies and submit them to the appropriate regulatory agencies
for marketing approval. 

Our business model is to develop or acquire unique
medical-related products, engage third parties to assist in the development and manufacturing of such products, and then distribute the
products through various distribution channels, including third parties. We own potentially life-saving technologies: the CardioMap 
heart monitoring and screening device; the Save A Life choking rescue device; and ONP-002 which is a unique neurosteroid drug compound
intended to treat mild traumatic brain injuries also known as concussions. We own fifty percent of another unique neuro-steroid, ONP-001,
intended to treat rare brain disorders. To date, none of our product candidates has received regulatory clearance or approval for commercial
sale. 

We intend to acquire other technologies and assets
and plan to be a trans-disciplinary product development company involved in the development and commercialization of products and technologies
that may be applied over various medical markets. 

We intend to license, improve and/or develop our
products and identify and select distribution channels. We plan to establish agreements with distributors to get products to market quickly
as well as to undertake and engage in our own direct marketing efforts. We will determine the most effective method of distribution for
each unique product that we include in our portfolio. 

We intend to engage third party research and development
firms who specialize in the creation of medical products to assist us in the development. We will apply for trademarks and patents as
we develop proprietary products.

Asset Purchase Agreement with Oragenics, Inc. 

On October 4, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with Oragenics, Inc. Oragenics the Purchaser ). Pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement, the we have agreed to sell and assign, certain assets and certain liabilities related to a segment of Odyssey s business
focused on developing medical products that treat brain related illnesses and diseases (the Purchased Assets to Oragenics
in exchange for (i) 1,000,000 in cash and 8,000,000 shares of convertible Series F Preferred Stock Series F Preferred Stock ),
on and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein (such transaction, the Odyssey Asset Purchase ). The Purchased
Assets include drug candidates for treating mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also known as concussion, and for treating Niemann Pick
Disease Type C (NPC), as well as our proprietary powder formulation and its nasal delivery device. 

We received 500,000 upon the execution of the
Purchase Agreement on October 4, 2023 and will receive the additional 500,000 upon the earlier of (a) the closing of the Purchase Agreement
(the Closing ), (b) within three (3) business days after the date that the Company has obtained the its stockholders 
approval approving the Odyssey Asset Purchase and (c) immediately upon the Purchasers wrongful termination of the Purchase Agreement
in breach of the Purchase Agreement. 

The closing of the Asset Purchase is expected
to be at the end of the fourth calendar quarter of 2023. 

See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information. 

Financial Information about Industry Segments 

We do not report our financial results by segment.
See financial statements. 

Our Growth Strategy 

 If the FDA clears or approves our product candidates
to be marketed commercially, we intend to enter into agreements with industry partners or qualified distributors throughout the United
States. A similar approach will be pursued if our product candidates are cleared or approved for marketing outside of the United States.
We intend to require such partners or distributors to pay us an initial license fee, as well as royalties based on gross sales. Retaining
exclusivity will be based on a mutually agreeable semi-annual or quarterly sales minimum. We have also decided to focus on international
growth because, generally, such international license agreements provide a stronger path to revenue and earnings than purely domestic
products. 

Our objective is to eventually grow revenue through
marketing and sales of each of our product candidates, CardioMap and Save a Life, and the two neuro-steroids, ONP-002 and ONP-001
if they gain regulatory approvals. Although no assurances can be given, management anticipates company growth from the following areas: 

1) 
 Distribution or License
 Agreements. Once any of our products in development are approved by the appropriate regulatory agency we will enter into
 distribution agreements with companies who have sales professionals with experience selling through a variety of sales methods.
 These distribution agreements will allow us to achieve sales and revenue more quickly in the medical products
 industries. 

2) 
 Identify and develop
 our products for additional proprietary uses. When funding allows, we intend to pursue development of CardioMap technology
 for use in other areas of the human body, such as the brain, liver and kidney. We also intend to utilize our proprietary nasal delivery
 system to deliver other drugs to the brain to treat brain related medical issues. 

2 

3) 
 The development and acquisition of new products. We intend to pursue the development and acquisition of other product candidates and market any new products, if cleared or approved. We intend, as capital resources permit, to develop such opportunities if and when they present themselves. 

4) 
 Seek partners to assist in the further development of our drug device combination products. We intend to seek partners to assist with the further development and clinical trials of both ONP-001 and ONP-002. Partnerships could be in the form of government grants or from industry pharmaceutical companies who have an interest in brain related drug therapies. 

We currently have no products authorized for commercial
distribution in either the United States, Europe or any other country. We have development programs for devices and pharmaceutical drugs,
which are in various stages of development. Currently we are only funding the development of ONP-002 intended to treat concussion. Due
to funding constraints and market conditions, the CardioMap and the choking rescue device programs have been suspended.
All of our products require regulatory clearance or approvals, and we cannot begin marketing and selling our product candidates until
we obtain applicable authorizations from the respective regulatory agency. FDA clearance or approval to market the products will be required
to sell in the United States. 

About CardioMap 

The CardioMap System is intended to be a
heart monitoring and screening device based on a novel method of Dispersion Mapping in ECG analysis for the early, non-invasive testing
for coronary heart disease CHD ). The heart monitoring system is intended to provide high quality 3-D visualization and
diagnosis of the heart using advanced signal analysis. The product is being designed for use in a professional setting or in remote settings
including in-home use. We have exclusive, royalty free rights to USPTO patent number 7,519,416 B2 related to the CardioMap technology. 

If FDA cleared or approved, CardioMap could
provide a better level of diagnosis with its improved sensitivity levels that can detect early warning signs that would normally be invisible
with standard ECG devices. The system could dramatically cut the costs associated with the detection of ischemic heart disease and will
prove to be an invaluable testing device for cardiologists, physicians, clinics, hospitals, the fitness industry, sports teams, emergency
facilities and general public. CardioMap was developed by VE Science Technology LLC, from whom we have purchased the product rights.
We have a working model of the device and associated software and plan to further develop the technology for clinical trials and a 510K
FDA submission when funding is secured. To sell, market and distribute the CardioMap product, clearance or approval from the FDA
is required. Such clearance or approval has not been obtained at this time.

About Save-a-Life 

In July 2019, we purchased all intellectual property
including two patents for the choking rescue device: patent Number RE45, 535 E, and patent Number 8,454,624 B2. The Save a Life SAL choking rescue device is currently in development and is designed to be a safe, and easy-to-use device for removing a lodged mass from
the throat of a choking victim. The device includes a pump for creating a vacuum chamber, which is connected seamlessly with a replaceable/disposable
mouthpiece. In an emergency, the SAL may be easily inserted into the victim s mouth, which depresses the tongue providing a clear
application. By pressing an activation button on the device, the internal pump is intended to deliver the appropriate amount of instantaneous
vacuum to dislodge the mass without harm or damage to the person. The application is intended to be instantly effective as the device
will be operational and effective in a matter of seconds. To sell, market and distribute the Save-a-Life product, clearance or approval
from the FDA is required. FDA clearance or approval has not been obtained at this time. The product development plan for the Save-a-Life
is below.

About the neurosteroid ONP-001 

The neurosteroid, ONP-001, is intended to improve
function and lifespan in pediatric disorders where Central Nervous System (CNS) de-myelination and cell death is widespread in the cortex,
subcortical nuclei, brainstem, and cerebellar regions. ONP-001, a new chemical entity, is designed to work through gene amplification
to simultaneously remove intra-neuronal debris while promoting antioxidant capacity and myelin repair/cell proliferation. Disorders like
Nieman Pick Type C disease are multi-faceted in their pathology and require a treatment that can work at many levels to stop progression.
The chemical compound for the neurosteroid being developed has completed an initial safety study in rats. Results of preclinical studies
suggest that ONP-001 may improve neuromotor, cognitive and mental performance. To market the ONP-001 neurosteroid, further development
and clinical studies are required. ONP-001 will also require approval by the FDA to be sold in the United States. 

Per our agreement with Prevacus, Inc. a Tallahassee,
Florida based biotech company, we have 50 ownership in the drug compound and associated intellectual property. The original agreement
also called for a joint venture to be created by the two companies. The term to create the joint venture has expired and a joint venture
is no longer planned. The United States Patent and Trademark Office issued patents covering methods of ONP-001 synthesis. 

The product development plan for ONP-001 has been
suspended and the project is not currently being funded.

About the neurosteroid ONP-002 

On March 1, 2021, Odyssey Health, Inc. purchased
one hundred percent (100 of the drug compound PRV-002 from Prevacus, Inc. Odyssey has changed the name of the drug to ONP-002. ONP-002
is a fully synthetic, non-naturally occurring neurosteroid being developed for the treatment of mTBI (concussion). Results of preclinical
studies suggest that ONP-002 has an equivalent, and potentially superior, neuroprotective effect compared to related neurosteroids. In
animal models of mild brain injury ONP-002 reduced the behavioral pathology associated with brain injury symptoms such as short-term memory
loss, depression/anxiety-like behavior, and motor-sensory impairment. The drug is administered through the nasal passage from a novel
device. ONP-002 is lipophilic and can cross the blood-brain barrier, thus supporting its potential to rapidly eliminate swelling, oxidative
stress, and inflammation in the brain while restoring proper blood flow through gene amplification. 

The drug has completed toxicology studies in rats
and dogs. Studies show that ONP-002 has a safety margin over 200X its predicted efficacious dose. ONP-002 to date has been shown to be
stable up to 104 degrees for 18-months. The drug candidate is spray-dry manufactured into a powder and filled into the intranasal device.
The device is lightweight and easy to use in the field. Odyssey s novel intranasal device is breath-propelled causing the soft palate
to close in the back of the nasopharynx. This mechanism traps ONP-002 in the nasal cavity allowing for more abundant and faster drug
availability in the traumatized brain. Safety studies have established a dosing regimen of 2X/day for fourteen days. The Phase I clinical
trial was performed in Melbourne, Australia with a Contract Research Organization (CRO), Avance Clinical Pty Ltd and Nucleus Network Pty
Ltd. The country of Australia provides a greater than 26 currency exchange advantage and a 43.5 rebate at the end of our fiscal year
from the Australian government on all Research and Development performed in Australia. 

A comprehensive Investigator s Brochure
was created and approved by the Alfred Ethics Committee by Odyssey Health s CRO in Australia. Phase 1 was designed to determine
the safety profile of the drug in healthy human subjects. It was double-blinded, randomized and placebo controlled (3:1, drug:placebo).
Phase 1 used a Single Ascending/Multiple Ascending (SAD/MAD) drug administration design. The SAD component was a 1X treatment (low, medium,
or high dose) and the MAD component was a 1X/day treatment for five consecutive days (low and medium dose). Blood and urine samples were
collected at multiple time points for safety pharmacokinetics. Standard safety monitoring was provided for each body system. 

Forty human subjects (31 males, 9 females) were
successfully enrolled in Phase I. The Safety Review Board, made up of medical doctors, has reviewed the trial data and has determined
the drug is safe and well tolerated at all dosing levels. 

In Phase II clinical trial, ONP-002 will be administered
to acutely concussed patients, 2x a day for fourteen days. Based on the Phase I data, we plan to apply for an Investigational New Drug
application with the FDA and conduct a Phase II trial in the United States. 

Patents on ONP-002 have been filed and/or issued
and a patent has been filed on the nasal delivery device as follows:

Competition 

We believe that the primary competition for our
products and services is from existing companies offering EKG equipment and anti-choking devices, as well as other pharmaceutical companies
engaged in the development of Orphan drugs. 

SAL Competitive Analysis 

Dechoker 

 The Dechoker is a device that can be used for
choking first aid on anyone 12 months or older, regardless of illness, disorder or other health-related condition. It utilizes a hand
powered pump system to extract blockages. 

LifeVac 

 LifeVac is designed with a valve to prevent any
air from exiting through the mask. This designed valve prevents air from pushing food or objects downward. This creates a one-way suction
to remove the lodged food or object. 

Act+Fast Heimlich maneuver training vests 

 Act+Fast Anti-Choking Trainer, Blue (AHA),
4-Pack. This device enables students to develop confidence in their ability to perform the Abdominal Thrust (Heimlich) Maneuver as recommended
by the American Heart Association (AHA). It has been designed to be realistic and easy to use. 

CardioMap Competitive Analysis 

None of the current rapid EKG devices have the
ability to digitally map the heart. Each of the below competitors give EKG read outs only. 

CardioResting (Nasiff) 

 The CardioResting ECG is the first complete
and full-featured 12 lead PC based cardiology system. The ECG is durable, reliable and easy to learn. It performs and manages tests
while saving money and working with your existing equipment. Our system is EMR compatible with an unlimited database. 

Welch Allyn PC Based Electrocardiograph The Welch Allyn device automatically transfers
patient information and test data into most EMRs without redundant work steps, misidentified patients, or delays from copying, scanning
and shredding ECG reports. 

QardioCore 

 QardioCore is a wireless medical grade ambulatory
ECG monitoring system that can identify atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias. No wires, gels or patches are required. No in-clinic fitting
nor technician needed - QardioCore is 100 deployed remotely.

little operating history, a history of losses and we cannot assure profitability. 

We have been incurring operating losses and cash
flow deficits since the inception of such operations. Our lack of operating history, and the lack of historical pro forma combined financial
information, makes it difficult for investors to evaluate our prospects for success. Prospective investors should consider the risks and
difficulties we might encounter, especially given our lack of an operating history or historical pro forma combined financial information.
There is no assurance that we will be successful, and the likelihood of success must be considered in light of our relatively early stage
of operations. As we have not begun to generate revenue, it is extremely difficult to make accurate predictions and forecasts of our finances.
There is no guarantee that our products or services will be attractive to potential consumers. 

There is substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. 

 We are in the development stage and are currently
seeking additional capital, mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, partnerships and other business arrangements to expand our product
offerings and generate revenue. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our future ability to generate revenue and
achieve profitable operations and, in the meantime, to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities
when they become due. External financing, predominantly by the issuance of equity and debt, will be sought to finance our operations;
however, there can be no certainty that such funds will be available at terms acceptable to us. These conditions indicate the existence
of material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We have not generated any revenue or profit from
operations since our inception. We expect that our operating expenses will increase over the next twenty-four months in order to continue
our development activities. Based on our average monthly expenses and current burn rate, we estimate that our cash on hand will not be
able to support our operations through the balance of this calendar year. This amount could increase if we encounter difficulties that
we cannot anticipate at this time or if we acquire other businesses. Should this amount not be sufficient to support our continuing operations,
we do not expect to be able to raise any additional capital through debt financing from traditional lending sources since we are not currently
generating a profit from operations. Therefore, we only expect to raise money through equity financing via the sale of our common stock
or equity-linked securities such as convertible debt. We are currently in discussions with a number of institutional investors who could
provide the capital required for our ongoing operations. If we cannot raise the money that we need in order to continue to operate our
business beyond the period indicated above, we will be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations.
If any of these were to occur, there is a substantial risk that our business would fail. If we are unsuccessful in raising additional
financing, we may need to curtail, discontinue, or cease operations. 

8 

Our actual financial position and results
of operations may differ materially from management s expectations. 

 We have experienced some changes in our operating
plans and certain delays in our plans. As a result, our revenue, net loss and cash flow may differ materially from our projections. The
process for estimating our revenue, net loss and cash flow requires the use of estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions
may be revised as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. In addition, the assumptions used
in planning may prove to be inaccurate, and other factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations. 

We expect to incur significant ongoing costs and
obligations related to our investment in infrastructure and growth and for regulatory compliance, which could have a material adverse
impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, future changes in regulations, more vigorous enforcement
thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to our operations, increased compliance costs or give rise to material
liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our efforts to
grow our business may be costlier than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating
expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications
and delays, and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market price of our Common Shares may
significantly decrease. 

Our limited operating history creates substantial
uncertainty about future results. 

We have limited operating history and operations
on which to base expectations regarding our future results and performance. To succeed, we must do most, if not all, of the following: 

raise corporate equity to support our operating costs and to have sufficient funds to develop, market and sell our products; 

locate strategic licensing and commercialization partners; 

obtain proper regulatory clearances domestically and abroad; 

attract, integrate, retain and motivate qualified management and sales personnel; 

successfully execute our business strategies; 

respond appropriately and timely to competitive developments; and 

develop, enhance, promote and carefully manage our corporate identity. 

Our business will suffer if we are unable to accomplish
these and other important business objectives. We are uncertain as to when, or whether, we will fully implement our contemplated business
plan and strategy or become profitable. 

Because we may never have net income from
our operations, our business may fail. 

 We have no history of profitability from operations.
There can be no assurance that we will ever operate profitably. Our success is significantly dependent on uncertain events, including
successful development of our products, establishing satisfactory manufacturing arrangements and processes, and the sale and distribution
of our products. If we are unable to generate significant revenues from sales of our products, we will not be able to earn profits or
continue operations. We can provide no assurance that we will generate any revenues or ever achieve profitability. If we are unsuccessful
in addressing these risks, our business will fail, and investors may lose all of their investment in our Company. 

9 

Our ability to generate positive cash flows
is uncertain. 

To develop and expand our business, we will need
to make significant up-front investments in our manufacturing capacity and incur research and development, sales and marketing, and general
and administrative expenses. In addition, our growth will require a significant investment in working capital. Our business will require
significant amounts of working capital to meet our project requirements and support our growth. We cannot provide any assurance that we
will be able to raise the capital necessary to meet these requirements. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on satisfactory
terms, we may be required to significantly curtail our operations and may not be able to fund our current production requirements, let
alone fund expansion, take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance our products, and respond to competitive
pressures. Any failure to obtain such additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
and financial condition. 

We need to raise additional funds, and such
funds may not be available on acceptable terms. 

We may consider issuing additional debt or equity
securities in the future to fund our business plan, for general corporate purposes or for potential acquisitions or investments. If we
issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new
equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we incur additional
debt, it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization, requiring us to pay additional interest expenses.
We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, in which case, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, execute
our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures. 

We may have difficulty raising additional
capital, which could deprive us of the resources necessary to implement our business plan, which would adversely affect our business,
results of operation and financial condition. 

We expect to continue devoting significant capital
resources to fund research and development and marketing. In order to support the initiatives envisioned in our business plan, we will
need to raise additional funds through the sale of assets, public or private debt or equity financing, collaborative relationships or
other arrangements. If our operations expand faster or at a higher rate than currently anticipated, we may require additional capital
sooner than we expect. We are unable to provide any assurance or guarantee that additional capital will be available when needed by our
company or that such capital will be available under terms acceptable to our company or on a timely basis. 

Our ability to raise additional financing depends
on many factors beyond our control, including the state of capital markets, the market price of our common stock and the development or
prospects for development of competitive products by others. Because our common stock is not listed on a major stock market, many investors
may not be willing or allowed to purchase it or may demand steep discounts. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity,
convertible debt or similar securities of our company, the percentage of ownership of our company by our company s stockholders
will be reduced, our company s stockholders may experience additional dilution upon conversion, and such securities may have rights
or preferences senior to those of our common stock. The preferential rights granted to the providers of such additional financing may
include preferential rights to payments of dividends, super voting rights, a liquidation preference, protective provisions preventing
certain corporate actions without the consent of the fund providers, or a combination thereof. We are unable to provide any assurance
that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. 

If adequate funds are not available or are not
available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our expansion, take advantage of potential opportunities, would be limited significantly.
We will also scale back or delay implementation of research and development of new products. Thus, the unavailability of capital could
substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

10 

The capital requirements necessary to implement
our business plan initiatives could pose additional risks to our business and stockholders. 

We require additional debt or equity financing
to implement our business plan and marketing strategy. Since the terms and availability of such financing depend, to a large degree, on
general economic conditions and third parties over which we have no control, we can give no assurance that we will obtain the needed financing
or that we will obtain such financing on attractive terms. In addition, our ability to obtain financing depends on a number of other factors,
many of which also are beyond our control, such as interest rates and national and local economic conditions. If the cost of obtaining
needed financing is too high or the terms of such financing are otherwise unacceptable in relation to the strategic opportunity we are
presented with, then we may decide to forego that opportunity. Additional indebtedness could increase our leverage and make us more vulnerable
to economic downturns and may limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures. Additional equity financing could result in dilution
to our stockholders. 

Our independent registered public accounting
firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial
statements. 

Our independent registered public accounting firm
has issued its audit opinion on our consolidated financial statements appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2023, including an explanatory paragraph as to substantial doubt with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, assuming we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, our net loss was 5,919,421, and we had an accumulated
deficit of 60,097,375 at July 31, 2023. As of July 31, 2023, we had current liabilities of 6,611,722, current assets of 405,888 and
a working capital deficit of 6,205,834. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern which
is dependent on our ability to raise the required additional capital or debt financing to meet short- and long-term operating requirements.
We may also encounter business endeavors that require significant cash commitments or unanticipated problems or expenses that could result
in a need for additional cash. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising capital from financing transactions.
To stay in business, we will need to raise additional capital through public or private sales of our securities or debt financing. In
the past, we have financed our operations by issuing secured and unsecured convertible debt and equity securities in private placements,
in some cases with equity incentives for the investor in the form of warrants to purchase our common stock, and we have borrowed from
related parties. We have sought, and will continue to seek, various sources of financing. If we raise additional funds through the issuance
of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our current stockholders could be reduced, and such securities might
have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or
available at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective business
endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our operations. If we are unable to obtain necessary capital,
we may have to cease operations. There are no additional commitments from anyone to provide us with financing. We can provide no assurance
as to whether our capital raising efforts will be successful or as to when, or if, we will be profitable in the future. Even if we achieve
profitability, we may not be able to sustain such profitability. If we are unable to obtain financing or achieve and sustain profitability,
we may have to suspend operations or sell assets, making us unable to execute our business plan. Failure to become and remain profitable
may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations. For additional information,
see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Going Concern. 

Raising additional capital by issuing securities
or through debt financings or licensing arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require
us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidate on terms unfavorable to us. 

To the extent that we raise additional capital
through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of such securities may
include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve
agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, making
capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships with third parties, we may have
to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidate, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidate,
or otherwise grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we may be
required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts for our product candidate or our preclinical
product candidates, or grant rights to develop and market potential future product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop
and market ourselves. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our product development and commercialization
goals and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to the Sale of the Purchased Assets 

We may not be able to successfully consummate
the Odyssey Asset Purchase Agreement with Oragenics. 

The closing of the Odyssey Asset Purchase Agreement
is subject to various closing conditions, including without limitation the following: (1) Odyssey shall have obtained all required consents
to the Odyssey Asset Purchase; (2) Odyssey shall have obtained its shareholders approval to the Odyssey Asset Purchase; (3) Oragenics
shareholders shall have approved (a) the increase in the its authorized Common Stock from Four Million One Hundred Sixty Six Thousand
Six Hundred Sixty Six (4,166,666) shares to Three Hundred Fifty Million (350,000,000) and (b) the conversion of Nineteen and Nine Tenths
Percent (19.9 of the Series F Preferred Stock into Common Stock; (4) no material adverse change shall have occurred to the Purchased
Assets; (5) Oragenics must have at least Five Million dollars 5,000,000) in cash at Closing; and (6) the Oragenics must have completed
its due diligence of the Purchased Assets to its satisfaction. There can be no assurances that such conditions will be satisfied. 

Oragenics may have difficulty raising additional
capital, which could deprive them of the resources necessary to implement our business plan, which would adversely affect the equity position
in Oragenics. 

Whether or not we successfully consummate the
Asset Purchase, Oragenics will need to raise additional capital to fund the development and commercialization of our product candidates
and to operate their business. The Oragenics need to raise additional capital is expected to increase if we successfully consummate
the Oragenics Asset Purchase. If Oragenics consummates the Asset Purchase, Oragenics expect their operating expenses to increase, both
due to additional employment costs and operating costs required to pursue the development of the Odyssey s assets. In order to support
the initiatives envisioned in the business plan, Oragenics will need to raise additional funds through the sale of assets, public or private
debt or equity financing, collaborative relationships or other arrangements. If Oragenics operations expand faster or at a higher rate
than currently anticipated, Oragenics may require additional capital sooner than they expect. We are unable to provide any assurance or
guarantee that additional capital will be available when needed by Oragenics or that such capital will be available under terms acceptable
to Oragenics or on a timely basis. 

Oragenics ability to raise additional financing
depends on many factors beyond our control, including the state of capital markets, the market price of their common stock and the development
or prospects for development of competitive products by others. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity, convertible
debt or similar securities of their company, the percentage of ownership in Oragenics by Odyssey stockholders will be reduced, our stockholders
may experience additional dilution upon conversion, and such securities may have rights or preferences senior to those of Oragenics 
common stock. The preferential rights granted to the providers of such additional financing may include preferential rights to payments
of dividends, super voting rights, a liquidation preference, protective provisions preventing certain corporate actions without the consent
of the fund providers, or a combination thereof. We are unable to provide any assurance that additional financing will be available on
terms favorable to Oragenics or at all. 

If adequate funds are not available or are not
available on acceptable terms, Oragenics ability to take advantage of the potential of assets acquired from us will be limited
significantly. With limited capital, Oragenics expects to continue to scale back or delay implementation of research and development of
all protocols. By implication, the unavailability of capital could substantially harm our investment in Oragenics. 

12 

Oragenics success with regard to
the Purchased Assets depends on the viability of Oragenics business strategy with regard to those assets, which is unproven and may be
unfeasible. 

Oragenics revenue and income potential with regard
to the Purchased Assets, in particular the concussion asset, are unproven, and Oragenics continues to develop our strategy for such assets.
Oragenics anticipated business model is based on a variety of assumptions based on a growing trend in the healthcare systems in
the United States and many other countries. These assumptions may not reflect the business and market conditions Oragenics actually faces.
As a result, Oragenics operating results could differ materially from those projected under Oragenics business model, and
Oragenics business model may prove to be unprofitable. 

The product candidate ONP-002 (the concussion
asset) being developed by us, which development under Oragenics will continue if we successfully consummate the Asset Purchase, is in
its early stages and will require extensive testing and clinical trials before it is commercialized. There is no guarantee that ONP-002
will be approved for commercial use. The product candidate ONP-001 (the potential treatment for Niemann Pick Disease Type C) Oragenics
is acquiring from us, is in its early stages and will require extensive testing and clinical trials before it is commercialized. There
is no guarantee that ONP-001 will be approved for commercial use. We currently own only 50 of the intellectual property related thereto.
The other 50 is owned by Prevacus. The joint venture with that third party has not been finalized. 

If we fail to obtain marketing authorization for
these product candidates, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. 

There are substantial inherent risks in
attempting to commercialize newly developed products, and, as a result, we may not be able to successfully develop the new products acquired
from Odyssey. 

If we successfully consummate the Asset Purchase,
Oragenics hopes to conduct research and development of the purchased technologies. However, commercial feasibility and acceptance of such
product candidates are unknown. Scientific research and development require significant amounts of capital and takes an extremely long
time to reach commercial viability, if at all. During the research and development process, we may experience technological barriers that
we may be unable to overcome. Because of these uncertainties, it is possible that some of Oragenics future product candidates will
never be successfully developed. If Oragenics is unable to successfully develop new products, Oragenics may be unable to generate new
revenue sources or build a sustainable or profitable business. 

Additionally, if we successfully consummate the
Asset Purchase, since Oragenics operates with limited resources and staff, Oragenics attention and resources will be diverted away
from other protocols which may result in further delays in the development and commercialization of such programs and the diminution of
our investment. 

We will need to achieve commercial acceptance
of our products, if cleared or approved, to generate revenues and achieve profitability. 

 If we successfully consummate the Asset Purchase,
superior products may be introduced that compete with the Purchased Assets, which would diminish or extinguish the uses for the products
candidates acquired by Oragenics, if cleared or approved. We cannot predict when significant commercial market acceptance for such products,
if cleared or approved, will develop, if at all, and we cannot reliably estimate the projected size of any such potential market. If markets
fail to accept such products, then Oragenics may not be able to generate revenue from them. Oragenics revenue growth and achievement of
profitability will depend substantially on Oragenics ability to introduce new products that are accepted by customers. Oragenics competitors
in the industry are predominantly large companies with longer operating histories, with significantly easier access to capital and other
resources and an established product pipeline than Oragenics. There can be no assurance that Oragenics will be able to establish ourselves
in their targeted markets, or, if established, that Oragenics will be able to maintain market position, if any. Oragenics commercial
opportunity may be reduced if their competitors develop new or improved products that are more convenient, more effective or less expensive
than our product candidates are. Competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory marketing authorization for their products more rapidly
or earlier than Oragenics may obtain marketing authorization, which could result in their competitors establishing a strong market position
before Oragenics is able to enter the market. If Oragenics is unable to cost-effectively achieve acceptance of their products by customers,
or if Oragenics products do not achieve wide market acceptance, then their business, and consequently our investment in Oragenics 
business will be materially and adversely affected. 

13 

The products candidates Oragenics hopes
to acquire from Odyssey are still in development, and Odyssey has not obtained authorization from any regulatory agency to commercially
distribute such products in any country and we may never obtain such authorizations. 

Oragenics currently has no products authorized
for commercial distribution in either the United States, Europe, or any other country. Similarly, the products candidates Oragenics hopes
to acquire from us are still in development. Like the product candidates Oragenics is developing, the Purchased Assets require regulatory
clearance or approvals. Oragenics cannot begin marketing and selling product candidates until they obtain applicable authorizations from
the applicable regulatory agencies. The process of obtaining regulatory authorization is expensive and time-consuming and can vary substantially
based upon, among other things, the type, complexity, and novelty of a product candidate. Changes in regulatory policy, changes in or
the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause
delays in the authorization of a product candidate or rejection of a regulatory application altogether. 

The FDA has substantial discretion in the review
process and may refuse to accept Oragenics application or may decide that data are insufficient to grant the request and require
additional pre-clinical, clinical, or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical
testing could delay, limit, or prevent marketing authorization from the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Any marketing authorization
from the FDA Oragenics ultimately obtains may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-market commitments that render the product
candidate not commercially viable. If Oragenics attempts to obtain marketing authorization are unsuccessful, Oragenics may be unable to
generate sufficient revenue to sustain and grow their business, and Oragenics business, financial condition, and results of operations,
and consequently, the value of our equity will be materially adversely affected. 

Oragenics is, and will continue to be,
dependent in significant part on outside scientists and third-party research institutions for research and development in order to be
able to commercialize product candidates. 

Oragenics currently has a limited number of employees
and resources available to perform the research and development necessary to commercialize their product candidates and potential future
product candidates. Oragenics therefore relies, and will continue to rely, on third-party research institutions, collaborators and consultants
for this capability. This will remain the case if we successfully consummate the Asset Purchase. 

Oragenics is heavily dependent upon the
ability and expertise of our management team and a very limited number of employees, and the loss of such individuals could have a material
adverse effect on Oragenics business, operating results or financial condition. 

Oragenics currently has a very small management
team. Oragenics success is dependent upon the ability, expertise, and judgment of Oragenics senior management. While employment
agreements are customarily used as a primary method of retaining the services of key employees, these agreements cannot assure the continued
services of such employees. Any loss of the services of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on Oragenics business, operating
results or financial condition. 

The loss of the services of any of these individuals
could harm Oragenics ability to successfully pursue the development of the Purchased Assets. If any of Oragenics executive
officers or key employees left or seriously injured and unable to work and they were unable to find a qualified replacement and/or
to obtain adequate compensation for such loss, Oragenics may be unable to manage our business, which could harm their operating results
and financial condition. 

If we successfully consummate the Asset Purchase,
Oragenics anticipates growth in their business and increased costs, and any inability to manage such growth could harm Oragenics 
business. Oragenics success will depend, in part, on their ability to effectively manage their growth and expansion. Any growth in, or
expansion of, Oragenics business is likely to continue to place a significant strain on their management and administrative resources,
infrastructure, and systems. In order to succeed, Oragenics will need to continue to implement management information systems and improve
our operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls. Oragenics will also need to train new employees and maintain
close coordination among our executive, accounting, finance, and operations organizations. These processes are time-consuming and expensive,
will increase management responsibilities and will divert management attention. Their inability or failure to manage such growth and expansion
effectively could substantially harm their business and adversely affect their operating results and financial condition, and, consequently,
the value of our equity in Oragenics.

Risks Related to Our Technology, Development
and Commercialization of our Product Candidates 

Our success depends on the viability of
our business model, which is unproven and may be unfeasible. 

Our revenue and income potential are unproven,
and the business model of Odyssey is new. Our new business model is based on a variety of assumptions based on a growing trend in the
healthcare systems in the United States and many other countries, where we are seeing a movement towards preventative medicine that is
directly decreasing general healthcare costs. 

The CardioMap , through its screening and
predictive values, is a tool, if approved or cleared, might be implemented in this preventative approach. Considering heart disease-caused
deaths are still the number one cause of death and one of the most important healthcare costs factors, the CardioMap device has potential
value in any medical practice. If approved or cleared for marketing, it could be an ideal device, allowing insurance companies to potentially
cut costs through early diagnostic and preventative care. These assumptions may not reflect the business and market conditions we actually
face. As a result, our operating results could differ materially from those projected under our business model, and our business model
may prove to be unprofitable. There is no guarantee that the device will be approved or cleared for commercial use. 

The Save a Life choking rescue device is in the
development stage and has not been approved or cleared for commercial use. Further development is required, and the final product will
require FDA approval or clearance. There is no guarantee that the device will be approved or cleared for commercial use. 

The product candidate ONP-001, for which we own
50 of the intellectual property, is in its early stages and will require extensive testing and clinical trials before it is commercialized.
There is no guarantee that ONP-001 will be approved for commercial use. The Joint Venture contemplated in the agreement has not been formed. 

The product candidate ONP-002 being developed
by us and is in its early stages and will require extensive testing and clinical trials before it is commercialized. There is no guarantee
that ONP-002 will be approved for commercial use. 

If we fail to obtain marketing authorization for
our product candidates, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. 

There are substantial inherent risks in
attempting to commercialize newly developed products, and, as a result, we may not be able to successfully develop new products. 

We plan to conduct research and development of
health-related technologies. However, commercial feasibility and acceptance of such product candidates are unknown. Scientific research
and development require significant amounts of capital and takes an extremely long time to reach commercial viability, if at all. During
the research and development process, we may experience technological barriers that we may be unable to overcome. Because of these uncertainties,
it is possible that some of our future product candidates will never be successfully developed. If we are unable to successfully develop
new products, we may be unable to generate new revenue sources or build a sustainable or profitable business. 

We will need to achieve commercial acceptance
of our products, if cleared or approved, to generate revenues and achieve profitability. 

Superior competitive products may be introduced,
or customer needs may change, which would diminish or extinguish the uses for our products, if cleared or approved. We cannot predict
when significant commercial market acceptance for our products, if cleared or approved, will develop, if at all, and we cannot reliably
estimate the projected size of any such potential market. If markets fail to accept our products, then we may not be able to generate
revenue from them. Our revenue growth and achievement of profitability will depend substantially on our ability to introduce new products
that are accepted by customers. If we are unable to cost-effectively achieve acceptance of our products by customers, or if our products
do not achieve wide market acceptance, then our business will be materially and adversely affected. 

15 

We currently only have four product candidates,
which are still in development, and we have not obtained authorization from any regulatory agency to commercially distribute the products
in any country and we may never obtain such authorizations. 

We currently have no products authorized for commercial
distribution in either the United States, Europe or any other country. We are developing the devices and pharmaceutical drugs which require
regulatory clearance or approvals, we cannot begin marketing and selling our product candidates until we obtain applicable authorizations
from the respective regulatory agency. The process of obtaining regulatory authorization is expensive and time-consuming and can vary
substantially based upon, among other things, the type, complexity and novelty of a product candidate. Changes in regulatory policy, changes
in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may
cause delays in the authorization of a product candidate or rejection of a regulatory application altogether. 

The FDA has substantial discretion in the review
process and may refuse to accept our application or may decide that our data are insufficient to grant the request and require additional pre-clinical, clinical,
or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay,
limit, or prevent marketing authorization from the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Any marketing authorization from the FDA we ultimately
obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-market commitments that render the product candidate not commercially viable.
If our attempts to obtain marketing authorization are unsuccessful, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain and grow
our business, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. 

We face significant competition in an environment
of rapid technological change, and our competitors may develop products that are more advanced or more effective than ours are which may
adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to successfully market our products. 

Our competitors in the industry are predominantly
large companies with longer operating histories, with significantly easier access to capital and other resources and an established product
pipeline than us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish ourselves in our targeted markets, or, if established, that
we will be able to maintain our market position, if any. Our commercial opportunity may be reduced if our competitors develop new or improved
products that are more convenient, more effective or less expensive than our product candidates are. Competitors also may obtain FDA or
other regulatory marketing authorization for their products more rapidly or earlier than we may obtain marketing authorization for ours,
which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 

Risks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties 

We expect to rely on third parties for the
worldwide marketing and distribution of our product candidates, who may not be successful in selling our products, if cleared or approved. 

We currently do not have adequate resources to
market and distribute any of our products, if cleared or approved, worldwide and expect to engage third-party marketing and distribution
companies to perform these tasks. While we believe that distribution partners will be available, we cannot assure you that the distribution
partners, if any, will succeed in marketing our products on a global basis. We may not be able to maintain satisfactory arrangements with
our marketing and distribution partners, who may not devote adequate resources to selling our products. If this happens, we may not be
able to successfully market our products, which would decrease or eliminate our ability to generate revenues. 

16 

Our products, if cleared or approved, may
be displaced by superior products developed by third parties. 

The healthcare industry is constantly undergoing
rapid and significant change. Third parties may succeed in developing or marketing products that are more effective than those developed
or marketed by us or that would make our products obsolete or non-competitive. Additionally, researchers could develop new procedures
and medications that replace or reduce the use of our products. Accordingly, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to respond
quickly to medical and technological changes through the development and introduction of new products. We may not have the resources to
do this. If our products become obsolete and our efforts to develop new products do not result in commercially successful products, then
our sales and revenues will decline. 

We are, and will continue to be, significantly
dependent, in-part, on outside scientists and third-party research institutions for our research and development in order to be able
to commercialize our product candidates. 

We currently have a limited number of employees
and resources available to perform the research and development necessary to commercialize our product candidates and potential future
product candidates. We therefore rely, and will continue to rely, on third-party research institutions, collaborators and consultants
for this capability. 

We will depend on third parties for the
manufacture and distribution of our product candidates and products, if cleared or approved, and the loss of our third-party manufacturer
and distributor could harm our business. 

We will depend on our third-party contract manufacturing
partner to manufacture and supply our devices and drugs for clinical and commercial purposes. Additionally, we will depend on a different
third-party distribution partner to warehouse and ship our products, if cleared or approved, to customers. Our reliance on a third-party
manufacturer and a distribution provider to supply us with our drug and devices and to provide such other distribution services exposes
us to risks that could delay our sales or result in higher costs or lost product revenues. In addition, manufacturers could encounter
difficulties, including, but not limited to, those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, in securing long-lead time components, achieving
volume production, quality control and quality assurance or suffer shortages of qualified personnel, which could result in their inability
to manufacture sufficient quantities of our commercially available product, if cleared or approved, to meet market demand. Our third-party
manufacturer or distributor may also fail to follow and remain in compliance with FDA regulations which could lead to significant delays
in the availability of materials for our product candidates or products, if cleared or approved and/or FDA enforcement actions against
them and/or us. 

If we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of
our product candidates and products that meet our specifications and quality standards, it will be difficult for us to compete effectively. 

We may be unable to build an effective
distribution network for our products, if cleared or approved. 

We currently have very few employees and we may
either build internal capabilities or rely on distributors to sell our products, if cleared or approved. We cannot assure you that we
will succeed in building an internal team or entering into and maintaining productive arrangements with an adequate number of distributors
that are sufficiently committed to selling our products, if cleared or approved. The establishment of a distribution network is expensive
and time consuming. As we launch new products and increase our marketing effort with respect to existing products, we will need to continue
to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled resources with significant technical knowledge. In addition, the commissions we pay for product
sales could increase over time, which would result in higher sales and marketing expenses. Furthermore, if we were to rely on distributors,
the current and potential distributors may market and sell the products of our competitors. Even if the distributors market and sell our
products, our competitors may be able, by offering higher commission payments or other incentives, to persuade these distributors to reduce
or terminate their sales and marketing efforts related to our products. The distributors may also help competitors solicit business from
our existing customers. Some of our independent distributors may likely account for a significant portion of our sales volume, and, if
we were to lose them, our sales could be adversely affected. Even if we engage and maintain suitable relationships with an adequate number
of distributors, they may not generate revenue as quickly as we expect them to, commit the necessary resources to effectively market and
sell our products, or ultimately succeed in selling our products. 

17 

Risks Related to Intellectual Property 

We may be unable to adequately protect its
proprietary and intellectual property rights. 

Our ability to compete may depend on the superiority,
uniqueness and value of any intellectual property and technology that we may develop in the future. We intend to protect our proprietary
rights by relying on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements with its employees
and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. Despite these efforts, any of the following occurrences may reduce the value
of any of our intellectual property: 

The market for our products and services may depend to a significant extent upon the goodwill associated with its trademarks and trade names, and its ability to register its intellectual property under U.S. federal and state law. 

Patents in the medical device industry involve complex legal and scientific questions and patent protection may not be available for some or any products; 

Our applications for trademarks and copyrights relating to our business may not be granted and, if granted, may be challenged or invalidated. 

Issued patents, trademarks and registered copyrights may not provide us with competitive advantages. 

Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of any of our products or intellectual property. 

Our efforts may not prevent others from the development and design of products similar to, competitive with, or superior to, those we develop. 

Another party may obtain a blocking patent and we would need to either obtain a license or design around the patent in order to continue to offer the contested feature or service in our products. 

The expiration of patent or other intellectual property protections for any assets owned by us could result in significant competition, potentially at any time and without notice, resulting in a significant reduction in sales. The effect we will experience from the loss of these protections on us and our financial results will depend, among other things, upon the nature of the market and the position of our products in the market from time to time, the growth of the market, the complexities and economics of manufacturing a competitive product and regulatory approval requirements, which could cause a material and adverse impact on our business. We may be forced to litigate to defend our intellectual property rights, or to defend against claims by third parties against us relating to intellectual property rights. 

We may not be able to protect intellectual
property that we hope to acquire, which could adversely affect our business. 

The companies that we hope to acquire may rely
on patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright protection to protect their technology. We believe that technological leadership can
be achieved through additional factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent
product enhancements, name recognition, and reliable product maintenance. Nevertheless, our ability to compete effectively depends in
part on our ability to develop and maintain proprietary aspects of our technology, such as patents. We may not secure future patents;
and patents that we may secure may become invalid or may not provide meaningful protection for our product innovations. In addition, the
laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States. Furthermore, there
can be no assurance that competitors will not independently develop similar products, reverse engineer our products, or,
if patents are issued to us, design around such patents. We also expect to rely upon a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret,
and other intellectual property laws to protect our proprietary rights by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees,
consultants, and vendors, and by controlling access to and distribution of our technology, documentation and other proprietary information.
There can be no assurance, however, that the steps to be taken by us will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that the
rights granted thereunder will provide a competitive advantage to us. Any such circumstance could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. While we are not currently engaged in any intellectual property litigation or
proceedings, there can be no assurance that we will not become so involved in the future or that our products do not infringe any intellectual
property or other proprietary right of any third party. Such litigation could result in substantial costs, the diversion of resources
and personnel, and significant liabilities to third parties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

18 

We may not be able to protect our trade
names and domain names. 

We may not be able to protect our trade
names and domain names against all infringers, which could decrease the value of our brand name and proprietary rights. We currently
hold the Internet domain name Odyssey Health, Inc. Domain names are generally regulated by Internet regulatory bodies, are subject
to change, and, in some cases, may be superseded, in some cases by by-laws, rules and regulations governing the registration of
trade names and trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as well as ascertain other common law rights. If the
domain registrars are changed, if new ones are created, or if we are deemed to be infringing upon another s trade name or
trademark, we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring or using, as the case may be, our domain name, trade names or
trademarks, which could adversely affect our brand name and other proprietary rights. 

We may be forced to litigate to enforce
or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of other parties 
proprietary rights. 

Any such litigation could be very costly and could
distract management from focusing on operating our business. The existence and/or outcome of any such litigation could harm our business.
We may become subject to litigation, including for possible product liability claims, which may have a material adverse effect on our
reputation, business, results from operations, and financial condition. We may be named as a defendant in a lawsuit or regulatory action.
We may also incur uninsured losses for liabilities which arise in the ordinary course of business, or which are unforeseen, including,
but not limited to, employment liability and business loss claims. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, sales, cash flow or financial condition. Further, the administration of medical substances to humans can result
in product liability claims by consumers. Product liability claims can be expensive, difficult to defend and may result in large judgments
or settlements against us. We may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance or other protection against potential liabilities
arising from product sales. Product liability claims could also result in negative perception of our products or other reputational damage
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, sales, cash flow or financial condition. 

If our intellectual property protection
is inadequate, competitors may gain access to our technology and undermine our competitive position. 

We regard our intended and future intellectual
property as important to our success, and we intend to rely on patent law to protect our proprietary rights. Despite our precautions,
unauthorized third parties may copy certain portions of our devices or products or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that
we regard as proprietary. We may seek additional patents in the future. We do not know if any future patent application will be issued
with the scope of the claims, we seek, if at all or whether any patents we receive will be challenged or invalidated. Thus, we cannot
assure you that any intellectual property rights that we may receive can be successfully asserted in the future or that they will not
be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same
extent, as do the laws of the United States. Our means of protecting any proprietary rights we may receive in the United States or abroad
may not be adequate and competitors may independently develop a similar technology. Any failure to protect our proprietary information
and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We may be subject to various litigation
claims and legal proceedings, including intellectual property litigation, such as patent infringement claims, which could adversely affect
our business. 

 We, as well as, our directors and officers, may
be subject to claims or lawsuits. These lawsuits may result in significant legal fees and expenses and could divert management s
time and other resources. If the claims contained in these lawsuits are successfully asserted against us, we could be liable for damages
and be required to alter or cease portions of our business practices or product lines. Any of these outcomes could cause our business,
financial performance and cash position to be negatively impacted. 

19 

Additionally, our commercial success will also
depend, in part, on not infringing on the patents or proprietary rights of others. There can be no assurance that the technologies and
products used or developed by us will not infringe such rights. If such infringement occurs and we are not able to obtain a license from
the relevant third party, we will not be able to continue the development, manufacture, use, or sale of any such infringing technology
or product. There can be no assurance that necessary licenses to third-party technology will be available at all or on commercially reasonable
terms. In some cases, litigation or other proceedings may be necessary to defend against or assert claims of infringement or to determine
the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of third parties. Any potential litigation could result in substantial costs to, and
diversion of, our resources and could have a material and adverse impact on us. 

An adverse outcome in any such litigation or proceeding
could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to cease using the subject technology or require us to license the subject technology
from the third party, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Risks Related to Government Regulation 

Our products are subject to substantial
federal and state regulations. 

Our research and development activities and the
manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates and products, if cleared or approved, are subject to the laws, regulations, and
guidelines in the United States and other countries in which the products will be marketed, if cleared or approved. Specifically, in the
United States, the FDA regulates, among other areas, new medical device clearances and approvals and the development and commercialization
of prescription drugs. 

Obtaining FDA marketing authorization will
be costly, may result in time-consuming delays and will subject us to ongoing compliance costs and regulatory risk for non-compliance. 

Obtaining FDA marketing authorization, through
clearance, or pre-market approval PMA for medical devices and approval of drugs can be expensive and uncertain, can take
years, and require detailed and comprehensive scientific and clinical data. Notwithstanding the expense, these efforts may never result
in FDA authorization. Even if we were to obtain regulatory authorization, it may not be for the uses we intended or which are commercially
attractive, in which case we would not be permitted to market our product for those uses. 

The FDA can delay, limit or deny authorization
of a device or drug for many reasons, including: 

our inability to demonstrate to the FDA s satisfaction that our product candidate is safe and effective for its intended
 users; 

the data from our
 pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support authorization, where required; and 

the manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements. 

In addition, the FDA may change its
authorization policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, which may prevent or
delay marketing authorization of our product candidates under development. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain clearance
or approval for our product candidates, could prevent us from generating revenue from our products, if cleared or approved, and
could adversely affect our business operations and financial results. 

20 

Even if granted, a 510(k) clearance, de novo
classification and clearance, or pre-market approval for any future product may place substantial restrictions on how our device or
drug is marketed or sold, and FDA will continue to place considerable restrictions on our products and operations. The manufacture,
distribution and sale of medical devices and drugs must comply with extensive laws and regulations, including those relating to
registration and listing, labeling, marketing, complaint handling, adverse event and medical device reporting, reporting of
corrections and removals, and import and export. If we or our facilities or those of our manufacturers or suppliers are found to be
in violation of applicable laws and regulations, or if we or our manufacturers or suppliers fail to take satisfactory corrective
action in response to an adverse inspection, the regulatory authority could take enforcement action, including any of the following
sanctions: 

untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 

customer notifications of repair, replacement, refunds, detention or seizure of our products; 

product recalls; 

operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 

refusing or delaying requests for marketing authorization of new products or modified products; 

withdrawing marketing authorizations that have already been granted; 

refusing to provide Certificates for Foreign Governments; 

refusing to grant export approval for our products; or 

pursuing criminal prosecution. 

Additionally, the FDA and other regulatory authorities
have broad enforcement powers. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could affect the perceived safety
and efficacy of our product candidate and dissuade our customers from using our product candidate, if and when it is authorized for marketing. 

We have and may continue to encounter substantial
delays in planned clinical trials, or our planned clinical trials for other indications may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy
of our product candidates to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. 

While we currently have no ongoing clinical trials,
we will need to conduct further clinical trials. Clinical trials are complex, expensive, time consuming, uncertain as to outcome and are
subject to substantial and unanticipated delays. Before we may begin clinical trials, if required, for one of our medical device product
candidates and if the clinical trial is determined to present a significant risk, we will be required to submit and obtain approval for
an investigational device exemption, or IDE, that describes, among other things, the manufacture of, and controls for, the device and
a complete investigational plan. Clinical trials generally involve a substantial number of patients in a multi-year study. 

 For our pharmaceutical product candidates, we
are required to submit an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, the contents of which are subject to discussions with the FDA
and include, among other things, results of preclinical studies and other testing, manufacturing information, proposed clinical trial
protocols and a general investigational plan. We cannot begin any clinical trials in the United States until 30 days after the IND has
been accepted by FDA. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision
of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research
subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing,
among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring the safety and the effectiveness, of criteria
to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development
and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent Investigational Review Board, or IRB, for each site proposing
to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical
trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical
trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the
clinical trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts
organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which may review data and endpoints at designated check
points, make recommendations and/or halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or
other grounds, with respect to the foregoing, such as an inadequate demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the
reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. 

21 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted
in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

Phase One: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness; 

Phase Two: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages, and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning; 

Phase Three: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk. 

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 

Because we do not have the infrastructure necessary
to conduct clinical trials, we will have to hire one or more contract research organizations, or CROs, to conduct trials on our behalf.
CRO contract negotiations may be costly and time consuming and we will rely heavily on the CRO to ensure that our trials are conducted
in accordance with regulatory and industry standards. We may encounter problems with our clinical trials and any of those problems could
cause us or the FDA to suspend those trials or delay the analysis of the data derived from them. Moreover, any failure to abide by the
applicable regulatory requirements by us, our CROs, and/or clinical trial sites may result in regulatory enforcement action against such
third parties or us. 

 We cannot guarantee that clinical trials
 will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of
 testing. Delays, including, but not limited to those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, can be costly and could negatively affect
 our ability to complete a clinical trial and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair
 our ability to receive marketing authorization and successfully commercialize our products. If we are unable to complete such
 planned clinical trials, or are unsuccessful in doing so, we may be unable to advance our product candidates to regulatory
 authorization and commercialization, which would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We may be substantially dependent on third
parties to conduct our clinical trials. 

 Since we may conduct clinical trials to obtain
FDA marketing authorization, we will need to rely heavily on third parties over the course of our clinical trials, and as a result will
have limited control over the clinical investigators and limited visibility into their day-to-day activities. Nevertheless,
we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory
and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and the foregoing
third parties are required to comply with current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by
the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these
cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail
to comply with applicable cGCP regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or
comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional nonclinical or clinical trials before approving our marketing
applications or may subject them or us to regulatory enforcement actions. We cannot be certain that, upon inspection, such regulatory
authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the cGCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials may be required
to be conducted with a large number of test patients. Our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations,
or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory marketing authorization
process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims
laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws. 

22 

Any third parties conducting our clinical trials
are not and will not be our employees and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot
control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical, clinical, and nonclinical programs. These
third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting
clinical studies or other development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. If these third parties do not successfully
carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy
of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for
other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory
marketing authorization of or successfully commercialize our product candidate. As a result, our financial results and the commercial
prospects for our product candidate would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed. 

If any of our relationships terminate with these
third-party CROs, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching
or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition
period when a new CRO begins work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially affect our ability to meet our desired clinical development
timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges
or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition,
and prospects. 

We may be required to suspend or discontinue
clinical trials due to side effects or other safety risks that could preclude approval of our products. 

Our clinical trials may be suspended at any time
for a number of reasons. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable
risk to participants. In addition, regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at
any time if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or that
they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. 

If we are unable to obtain a reimbursement
code from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services so that our devices or drugs, following receipt of marketing authorization
are covered under Medicare and Medicaid, this could have a negative impact on our intended sales and would have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and operating results. 

 We plan to submit an application to the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services for a reimbursement code so that our devices and drugs are covered under Medicare and Medicaid following
receipt of marketing authorization. However, there can be no assurance that our application will be successful, or that we will be able
to obtain a reimbursement code in a timely manner. In the event that we do not obtain a reimbursement code, our customers may be unable
to obtain reimbursement for their purchases under private or government-sponsored insurance plans, which could have a negative impact
on our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 

If we fail to comply with healthcare laws,
we could face substantial penalties and financial exposure, and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 

We do not have a product available for sale in
the United States. If, however, we achieve this goal, the availability of payments from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers
would mean that many healthcare laws would place limitations and requirements on the manner in which we conduct our business, including
our sales and promotional activities and interactions with healthcare professionals and facilities. In some instances, our interactions
with healthcare professionals and facilities that occurred prior to commercialization (e.g., the granting of stock options) could have
implications at a later date. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, among others: (i) the federal healthcare programs
Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying
remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or
recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, (ii) federal
false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims
for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us
if we provide coding and billing advice to customers, or under theories of implied certification where the government and qui
tam relators may allege that device companies are liable where a product that was paid for by the government in whole or in part
was promoted off-label, lacked necessary marketing authorization, or failed to comply with good manufacturing
practices or other laws; (iii) transparency laws and related reporting and/or disclosures such as the Sunshine Act; and/or (iv) state
law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed
by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, many of which differ from their federal counterparts in significant ways, thus
complicating compliance efforts. 

23 

If our operations are found to be in violation
of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil
and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring
of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability
to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that
their provisions are open to a variety of evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion. Any action against us for violation of
these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s
attention from the operation of our business. 

Our communications regarding product candidates,
even while in development, are subject to extensive government scrutiny. We may be subject to governmental, regulatory and other
legal proceedings relative to advertising, promotion, and marketing, and communications with study subjects and healthcare professionals,
which could have a significant negative effect on our business. 

 We are subject to governmental oversight and
 associated civil and criminal enforcement relating to advertising, promotion, and marketing, and such enforcement is evolving and
 intensifying. Communications regarding our products in development and regarding our clinical trials may subject us to enforcement
 if they do not comply with applicable laws and regulations. In the United States, we are potentially subject to enforcement from the
 FDA, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the FTC ), the
 Department of Justice, and state and local governments. Other parties, including private plaintiffs, are also commonly bringing
 suit against pharmaceutical and medical device companies. We may be subject to liability based on the actions of individual
 employees and third-party contractors carrying out activities on our behalf. 

U.S. legislative or FDA regulatory reforms
may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and to manufacture, market and distribute
our products after marketing authorization is obtained. 

 From time to time, legislation is drafted and
introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing
of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the
FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing
regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of future products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often
revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict
whether legislative or FDA regulation changes will be enacted, or whether guidance or interpretations will change, and what the impact
of such changes, if any, may be. 

Risks Related to our Business Operations 

Failure to implement our business strategy
could adversely affect our operations. 

Our financial position, liquidity and results
of operations depend on our management s ability to execute our business strategy. Key factors involved in the execution of the
business strategy include: 

successful sales through indirect sales distribution; 

continued investment in technology to support operating efficiency; 

continued access to significant funding and liquidity sources; 

achieving the desired cost of goods on inventory; and 

obtaining the required regulatory clearances or approvals from the FDA. 

Our failure or inability to execute any element
of our business strategy could materially adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. 

24 

Our inability to attract, train and retain
additional qualified personnel may harm our business and impede the implementation of our business strategy. 

We may need to attract,
integrate, motivate and retain personnel with specific qualifications in the future . Competition for these individuals in our industry
and geographic region is intense, and we may be unable to attract, assimilate or retain such highly qualified personnel in the future.
Our business cannot continue to grow if we are unable to attract such qualified personnel. Our failure to attract and retain highly trained
personnel that are essential to our business may limit our growth rate, which would harm our business and impede the implementation of
our business strategy. 

We may be unable to maintain sufficient
product liability insurance. 

We may incur product liability for products sold
through our distribution chain. Consumers may sue if products sold through our distribution chain or purchased through our websites are
defective or injure the user. This type of claim could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant
damages. At this time, we carry no product liability insurance. As a result, any legal claims, whether or not successful, could seriously
damage our reputation and business. 

Conducting any future clinical trials of
our product candidates and any future commercial sales of a product candidate may expose us to expensive product liability claims, and
we may not be able to maintain product liability insurance on reasonable terms or at all and may be required to limit commercialization
of our product candidates. 

We face an inherent risk of product liability
as a result of the preclinical and future clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk when and if we
commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if our product candidates cause or are perceived to cause injury or are found
to be otherwise unsuitable during preclinical or clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims
may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence,
strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully
defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit testing and commercialization
of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits
or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: 

decreased or interrupted demand for our products; 

injury to our reputation; 

withdrawal of clinical trial participants and inability to continue our clinical trials; 

initiation of investigations by regulators; 

costs to defend the related litigation; 

a diversion of management s time and our resources; 

substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients; 

product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions; 

loss of revenue; 

exhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources; 

the inability to commercialize any product candidate; and 

a decline in our share price. 

Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability
insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of
products we develop, alone or with collaborators. Our insurance policies may have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product
liability claim for which we have no coverage. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed
our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay
such amounts. Even if our agreements with any future corporate collaborators entitle us to indemnification against losses, such indemnification
may not be available or adequate should any claim arise. 

25 

We anticipate growth in our business, and
any inability to manage such growth could harm our business. 

Our success will depend, in part, on our ability
to effectively manage our growth and expansion. Any growth in, or expansion of, our business is likely to continue to place a significant
strain on our management and administrative resources, infrastructure and systems. In order to succeed, we will need to continue to implement
management information systems and improve our operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls. We will also
need to train new employees and maintain close coordination among our executive, accounting, finance and operations organizations. These
processes are time consuming and expensive, will increase management responsibilities and will divert management attention. Our inability
or failure to manage our growth and expansion effectively could substantially harm our business and adversely affect our operating results
and financial condition. 

Our inability to retain and properly insure
against the loss of the services of our chief executive officer and other key personnel may harm our business and impede the implementation
of our business strategy. 

 Our future success depends significantly on the
skills and efforts of Joseph Michael Redmond, President, CEO and Director and possibly other key personnel. The loss of the services of
any of these individuals could harm our business and operations. In addition, we have not obtained key person life insurance on any of
our key employees. If any of our executive officers or key employees left or were seriously injured and unable to work and we were unable
to find a qualified replacement and/or to obtain adequate compensation for such loss, we may be unable to manage our business, which could
harm our operating results and financial condition. 

We participate in transactions and make
tax calculations for which the ultimate tax determination may be uncertain. 

We participate in many transactions and make tax
calculations during the course of our business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. While we believe we maintain provisions
for uncertain tax positions that appropriately reflect our risk, these provisions are made using estimates of the amounts expected to
be paid based on a qualitative assessment of several factors. It is possible that liabilities associated with one or more transactions
may exceed our provisions due to audits by, or litigation with, relevant taxing authorities which may materially adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations. 

We may indemnify our directors and officers
against liability to us and our stockholders, and such indemnification could increase our operating costs. 

Our bylaws allow us to indemnify our directors
and officers against claims associated with carrying out the duties of their offices. Our bylaws also allow us to reimburse them for the
costs of certain legal defenses. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted
to our directors, officers or control persons, we have been advised by the SEC that such indemnification is against public policy and
is therefore unenforceable. Since our directors and officers are aware that they may be indemnified for carrying out the duties of their
offices, they may be less motivated to meet the standards required by law to properly carry out such duties, which could increase our
operating costs. Further, if our directors and officers file a claim against us for indemnification, the associated expenses also could
increase our operating costs. 

If we fail to develop or maintain an effective
system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent financial fraud. As a result, current
and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting. 

We are subject to the risk that sometime in the
future our independent registered public accounting firm could communicate to the board of directors that we have deficiencies in our
internal control structure that they consider to be significant deficiencies. A significant deficiency is
defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is more than a
remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the entity s financial statements will not be prevented or detected by the entity s
internal controls. 

26 

Effective internal controls are necessary for
us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud,
we could be subject to regulatory action or other litigation and our operating results could be harmed. We are required to document and
test our internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, or SOX ), which requires our management to annually assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. 

We currently are not an accelerated filer 
as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Section
404 requires us to include an internal control report with our Annual Report on Form 10-K. That report must include management s
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year. This report must also
include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified. As of July 31, 2023,
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on SEC guidance on conducting such assessments
and on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control and Integrated Framework,
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Management concluded, during the
year ended July 31, 2023, that our internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of U.S.
GAAP rules. Management realized there were deficiencies in the design or operation of our internal control that adversely affected our
internal control, which management considers to be material weaknesses. A material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting may increase the chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing, and require
additional expenditures to comply with these requirements. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition. For additional information, see Item 9A Controls and Procedures. 

It may be time-consuming, difficult, and costly
for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to hire
additional financial reporting, internal controls, and other finance personnel in order to develop and implement appropriate internal
controls and reporting procedures. If we are unable to comply with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, then we
may not be able to obtain the independent accountant certifications required by such act, which may preclude us from keeping our filings
with the SEC current. 

If we are unable to maintain the adequacy of our
internal controls, as those standards are modified, supplemented, or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we may
conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. Failure
to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to face regulatory action and cause investors to lose
confidence in our reported financial information, either of which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. 

Our Articles of Incorporation provide that
certain proceedings may only be instituted in the District Courts of Nevada, which may prevent or delay such proceedings and will increase
the costs to enforce stockholder rights. 

Our Articles of Incorporation provide that the
following actions and proceedings may only be brought in the courts located in the State of Nevada: (i) derivative actions brought on
behalf of the company, (ii) any action asserting breach of fiduciary duty by the directors or officers, (iii) any action brought under
the Business Associations, Securities and Commodities statutes of the State of Nevada, and (iv) actions asserting a claim under the internal
affairs doctrine. No court has determined that such provisions are enforceable in Nevada, and we may be forced to defend proceedings brought
in other states if such provision is ruled unenforceable. If enforceable, claims covered by this provision may be maintained in the courts
of the State of Nevada only if such courts have personal jurisdiction over the defendants. If the State of Nevada does not have personal
jurisdiction over any named defendant, this provision may have the effect of preventing the prosecution of any claim. Additionally, because
stockholders may initiate such actions only in the State of Nevada, stockholders will be required to incur additional costs and expense
such as engaging legal counsel authorized to practice in Nevada. Moreover, the laws of the State of Nevada may be more favorable to us
or our management than the laws of the state in which any stockholder resides. 

27 

Our certificate of incorporation allows
our board to create new series of preferred stock without approval by our stockholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the
holders of our common stock. 

Our board of directors has the authority to fix
and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our board of directors also has the authority to issue preferred
stock without stockholder approval. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock granting
holders a preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the
holders of common stock, and the right to redemption of the shares, together with a premium prior to the redemption of our common stock.
In addition, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our
common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result
in dilution to our existing stockholders. 

If our expenses are greater than anticipated,
then we will have fewer funds with which to pursue our plan of operations and our financing requirements will be greater than anticipated. 

 We may find that the costs of carrying out
 our plan of operations are greater than we anticipate. We expect our expenses to increase over time in connection with our ongoing
 activities, particularly if and as we: invest in marketing and distribution capabilities in support of developing and potentially
 commercializing our products in the U.S., if cleared or approved; make improvements to product design; launch the ONP-002 trial
 or conduct other trials of the products, subject to discussion with the FDA; pursue regulatory clearances and approvals; maintain,
 expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; engage third party manufacturers; and add additional personnel. Increased
 operating costs may cause the amount of financing that we require to increase. Investors may be more reluctant to provide additional
 financing if we cannot demonstrate that we can control our operating costs. There is no assurance that additional financing required
 as a result of our operating costs being greater than anticipated will be available to us. If we do not control our operating
 expenses, then we will have fewer funds with which to carry out our plan of operations, which could result in the failure of our
 business. 

We are heavily dependent upon the ability
and expertise of our management team and a very limited number of employees and the loss of such individuals could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. 

We currently have a very small management team.
Our success is dependent upon the ability, expertise and judgment of our senior management. While employment agreements are customarily
used as a primary method of retaining the services of key employees, these agreements cannot assure the continued services of such employees.
Any loss of the services of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. 

Our ability to use net operating losses
to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. 

Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, substantial changes in a corporation s ownership may limit the amount of net operating losses,
or NOLs, that can be utilized annually in the future to offset the corporation s (and the corporation s affiliates U.S. federal and state taxable income. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of more
than 50 within any three-year period. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the corporation that underwent
the ownership change, immediately before the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect any limitation in future
years (including by way of exercising of warrants). 

28 

We are a smaller reporting company 
under federal securities laws and we cannot be certain whether the reduced reporting requirements applicable to such companies will make
our common stock less attractive to investors. 

We are a smaller reporting company 
under federal securities laws. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of exemptions from
various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company so long as our public float remains
less than 250 million as of the last business day of our most recently-completed second fiscal quarter. We cannot predict if investors
will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive
as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline or be more volatile. 

Investors could lose confidence in our financial
reports, and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected, if our internal controls over financial reporting are found not
to be effective by management or by our independent registered public accounting firm. 

As long we remain a non-accelerated filer,
we are exempt from the attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting by our independent auditors
pursuant to section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 but are required to make our own internal assessment of the effectiveness
of our internal controls over financial reporting. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could affect the accuracy and timing
of our financial reporting. Investors could lose confidence in our financial reports, and the value of our common stock may be harmed,
if our internal controls over financial reporting are found not to be effective by management or by our independent registered public
accounting firm. 

Several people who work for us on a part-time
consulting basis may be subject to conflicts of interest. 

Several people who provide services to us are
part-time consultants. Each may devote part of his working time to other business endeavors, including consulting relationships with other
corporate entities, and may have responsibilities to these other entities. Because of these relationships, some of the persons who provide
services to us may be subject to conflicts of interest. Such conflicts may include deciding how much time to devote to our affairs, as
well as what business opportunities should be presented to us. 

Our business and operations would suffer
in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks or a deficiency in our cyber-security. 

 Despite the implementation of security measures,
our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural
disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions (including ransomware attacks)
over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization.
No network or system can ever be completely secure, and the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks
or cyber intrusion, including, but not limited to,by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, have generally increased
as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks, and intrusions from around the world have increased. If such an event
were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in operations, reputation, or a material disruption of our development
programs for an indeterminate period of time. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical
trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data.
In some cases, data cannot be reproduced. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to
our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur material legal claims
and liability, damage to our reputation, and the further development of our devices and drugs or any future product candidate could be
delayed. If a security breach results in the exposure or unauthorized disclosure of personal information, we could incur additional costs
associated with data breach notification and remediation expenses, investigation costs, regulatory penalties and fines, and legal proceedings.
Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to such breaches or attacks. 

29 

Challenges to our tax positions in
U.S. or non-U.S. jurisdictions, the interpretation and application of recent U.S. tax legislation or other changes in U.S.
or non-U.S. taxation of our operations could harm our business, revenue and financial results. 

 We operate, or intend to operate, in a number
of tax jurisdictions, including in the United States at the federal, state and local levels, and in Australia, and we therefore are or
will be subject to review and potential audit by tax authorities in these various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining
our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we take and challenge
our tax positions. Successful unilateral or multi-jurisdictional actions by various tax authorities may increase our worldwide effective
tax rate, result in additional taxes or other costs or have other material consequences, which could harm our business, revenue and financial
results. 

Our effective tax rate may also change from year
to year or vary materially from our expectations based on changes or uncertainties in the mix of activities and income allocated or earned
among various jurisdictions in the US, changes in tax laws and the applicable tax rates in these jurisdictions (including future tax laws
that may become material), tax treaties between countries, our eligibility for benefits under those tax treaties and the valuation of
deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such changes could result in an increase in the effective tax rate applicable to all or a portion
of our income, impose new limitations on deductions, credits or other tax benefits or make other changes that may adversely affect our
business, cash flows or financial performance. For example, if we are unable to fully realize the benefit of interest expense incurred
in future periods as a result of recent tax law changes (as discussed below), we may need to recognize a valuation allowance on any related
deferred tax assets, which would impact our annual effective income tax rate. 

Risks Related to Our Common Stock and Its Market
Value 

Your ownership will be diluted by future
issuances of capital stock. 

Our business strategy requires us to raise additional
equity capital through the sale of common stock or preferred stock. Your percentage of ownership will become diluted as we issue new shares
of stock. Stockholders have no rights to buy additional shares of stock in the event we issue new shares of stock, known as preemptive
rights. We may issue common stock, convertible debt or common stock pursuant to a public offering or a private placement, upon exercise
of warrants or options, or to sellers of properties we directly or indirectly acquire instead of, or in addition to, cash consideration.
Investors purchasing common stock in this Offering who do not participate in any future stock issues will experience dilution in the percentage
of the issued and outstanding stock they own. 

We have limited capitalization and may require
financing, which may not be available. 

We have limited capitalization, which increases
our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limits our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes
in our business and industry, and may place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with sufficient capitalization. If we are
unable to obtain sufficient financing on satisfactory terms and conditions, we will be forced to curtail or abandon our plans or operations.
Our ability to obtain financing will depend upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. 

Investors may experience dilution in the
value of the shares of common stock. 

We anticipate offering common stock or preferred
stock in offerings, which could cause further dilution. 

30 

If our business is unsuccessful, our stockholders
may lose their entire investment. 

 Although our stockholders will not be bound by
or held personally liable for our expenses, liabilities or obligations beyond their total original investments in our common stock, if
we suffer a deficiency in funds with which to satisfy our obligations, our stockholders as a whole may lose their entire investment in
our company. 

The sale or issuance of our common stock
to Lincoln Park may cause dilution and the sale of the shares of common stock acquired by Lincoln Park, or the perception that such sales
may occur, could cause the price of our common stock to fall. 

On August 14, 2020, we entered into a Purchase
Agreement with Lincoln Park and, on that date, we sold 602,422 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park in an initial purchase under
the Purchase Agreement for a total purchase price of 250,000. We also issued 793,802 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as consideration
for its irrevocable commitment to purchase our common stock under the Purchase Agreement. The remaining shares of our common stock that
may be issued under the Purchase Agreement may be sold by us to Lincoln Park at our discretion from time to time over a 36-month period
commencing after the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including that the SEC has declared effective
the related registration statement and that such registration statement remains effective. The purchase price for the shares that we may
sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will fluctuate based on the price of our common stock. Depending on market liquidity
at the time, sales of such shares may cause the trading price of our common stock to fall. 

 Subject to the terms of the Purchase Agreement,
we generally have the right to control the timing and amount of any future sales of our shares to Lincoln Park. Additional sales of our
common stock, if any, to Lincoln Park will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. We may ultimately decide
to sell to Lincoln Park all, some, or none of the additional shares of our common stock that may be available for us to sell pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement. If and when we do sell shares to Lincoln Park, after Lincoln Park has acquired the shares, Lincoln Park may
resell all or some of those shares at any time or from time to time in its discretion. Therefore, sales to Lincoln Park by us could result
in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares
of our common stock to Lincoln Park, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related
securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales. As of July 31, 2023, Lincoln Park had
purchased a total of 7,382,518 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 0.35 per share for total proceeds of 2,600,487.
Subsequent to July 31, 2023 and through October 30, 2023, we sold 500,000 shares of our common stock to LPC for total proceeds of 45,820.
As of October 30, 2023, LPC had purchased a total of 7,882,518 shares of our common stock for total proceeds of 2,646,306 and the remaining
purchase availability was 7,603,694 and the remaining shares available were 11,388,846. 

A limited public trading market exists for our
common stock, which makes it difficult for our stockholders to sell their common stock on the public markets. Any trading in our shares
may have a significant effect on our stock prices. 

Although our common stock is listed for quotation
on the OTC Markets, under the symbol ODYY, the trading activity of our common stock is volatile and may not develop or be
sustained. As a result, any trading price of our common stock may not be an accurate indicator of the valuation of our common stock. Any
trading in our shares could have a significant effect on our stock price. If a more liquid public market for our common stock does not
develop, then investors may not be able to resell the shares of our common stock that they have purchased and may lose all of their investment.
No assurance can be given that an active market will develop or that a stockholder will ever be able to liquidate its shares of common
stock without considerable delay, if at all. Many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities. Even if
an investor finds a broker willing to affect a transaction in our securities, the combination of brokerage commissions, state transfer
taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price. Furthermore, our stock price may be impacted by factors that
are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. These market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and
market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates, and international currency fluctuations, may adversely affect the market price
and liquidity of our common stock. 

31 

Our common stock may never be listed on
a national exchange and is subject to being removed from the OTC Marketplace. 

 Our common stock is quoted for trading on the
OTCQB Marketplace. Should we fail to satisfy the fully reporting eligibility standards of OTC Markets for the OTC Markets, the trading
price of our common stock could continue to suffer, and the trading market for our common stock may become less liquid and our common
stock price may be subject to increased volatility. 

Our common stock is deemed to be a penny
stock, which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares due to suitability requirements. 

 Our stock is categorized as a penny stock, 
as that term is defined in SEC Rule 3a51-1, which generally provides that a penny stock is any equity security that has
a market price (as defined) less than U.S. 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock
rules, including Rule 15g-9, which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established
customers and accredited investors. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise
exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about
penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current
bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly
account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. The bid and offer quotations, and
the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the
transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock
rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special
written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement
to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market
for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers
to trade our securities and reduce the number of potential investors. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest
in, and limit the marketability of, our common stock. 

The sale of shares of our common stock could
cause the price of our common stock to decline. 

Depending on market liquidity at the time, a sale
of shares covered by a registration statement could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. The sale of a substantial
number of shares of our common stock under a registration statement, or the anticipation of such a sale, could make it more difficult
for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we otherwise might desire to affect such
sales. 

A low market price would severely limit
the potential market for our common stock. 

 Historically, our common stock has traded at a
price below 5.00 per share, subjecting trading in the stock to certain SEC rules requiring additional disclosures by broker-dealers.
These rules generally apply to any non-NASDAQ equity security that has a market price share of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain
exceptions (a penny stock ). Such rules require the delivery, before any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule
explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers
who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and institutional or wealthy investors. For these types of transactions,
the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent
to the transaction before the sale. The broker-dealer must also disclose the commissions payable to the broker-dealer, current bid and
offer quotations for the penny stock, and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and
the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Such information must be provided to the customer orally or in writing before
or with the written confirmation of trade sent to the customer. Monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for
the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. The additional burdens imposed on broker-dealers
by such requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock. 

32 

If applicable, FINRA sales practice requirements
could limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock. 

In addition to the penny stock rules promulgated
by the SEC, above, FINRA rules (which would apply to our common stock in the event that our common stock ultimately becomes traded over
the counter via the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board) require that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have
reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Under these FINRA rules, before recommending speculative
low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the
customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA
believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. If
these FINRA rules were to apply to our common stock, such application would make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that
their customers buy our common stock, which could limit the ability to buy and sell our common stock and have an adverse effect on the
market value for our shares of common stock. 

An investor s ability to trade our
common stock may be limited by trading volume. 

A consistently active trading market for our common
stock may not occur on a national stock exchange or an automated quotation system. A limited trading volume may prevent our stockholders
from selling shares at such times or in such amounts as they otherwise may desire. 

A limited number of stockholders collectively
own a significant portion of our common shares and may act, or prevent corporate actions, to the detriment of other stockholders. 

A limited number of stockholders, including our
founders and members of the Board of Directors and our management, currently own a significant portion of our outstanding common shares.
Accordingly, these stockholders may, if they act together, exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval,
including the election of a majority of our directors and the determination of significant corporate actions. This concentration could
also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that could otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. 

The reverse split of our common stock could
decrease our total market capitalization and increase, and may continue to increase, the volatility of our stock price. 

At our annual stockholder meeting held on January
12, 2023, the stockholders approved the proposal that granted the Board discretionary authority to amend our Certificate of Incorporation
to effect a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock in a range of not less than two shares and not
more than 200 shares at any time on or before December 31, 2023. As determined by our Board, such stock split could be effected at a time
and choosing of the Board. The amendment did not change the number of authorized shares of common stock or preferred stock or the relative
voting power of our stockholders. The number of authorized shares will not be reduced. The number of authorized but unissued shares of
our common stock will materially increase and will be available for re-issuance. We reserve the right not to effect any reverse stock
split if the Board does not deem it to be in the best interests of our stockholders and the Board's decision as to whether and when to
effect the reverse stock split will be based on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions, existing and expected trading
prices for our common stock, actual or forecasted results of operations, and the likely effect of such results on the market price of
our common stock. 

There can be no assurance that the total market
capitalization of our common stock after the reverse stock split will be equal to or greater than the total market capitalization before
the reverse stock split or that the per share market price of our common stock following the reverse stock split will increase in proportion
to the reduction in the number of shares of common stock outstanding before the reverse stock split. Furthermore, a decline in the market
price of our common stock after the reverse stock split may result in a greater percentage decline than would occur in the absence of
a reverse stock split, and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected following such a reverse stock split. 

33 

The reverse stock split could increase our
authorized but unissued shares of common stock, which could negatively impact a potential investor. 

Because the number of authorized shares of our
common stock will not be reduced proportionately, the reverse stock split could increase the Board s ability to issue authorized
and unissued shares without further stockholder action. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into
common stock may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and relative voting power and may cause a decline in the trading price of
the common stock. We could use the shares that are available for future issuance in dilutive equity financing transactions, or to oppose
a hostile takeover attempt or delay or prevent changes in control or changes in or removal of management, including transactions that
are favored by a majority of the stockholders or in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current
market prices or benefit in some other manner. 

A decline in the price of our common stock
could affect our ability to raise any required working capital and adversely affect our operations. 

A decline in the price of our common stock could
result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise any required capital for our operations.
Because our operations to date have been principally financed through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common
stock could have an adverse effect upon our liquidity and our continued operations. A reduction in our ability to raise equity capital
in the future may have a material adverse effect upon our business plans and operations. If our stock price declines, we may not be able
to raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. 

Trading of our common stock could be sporadic,
and the price of our common stock may be volatile; we caution you as to the highly illiquid nature of an investment in our shares. 

 Our common stock is listed on the OTCQB. Securities
of microcap and small-cap companies have experienced substantial volatility in the past, often based on factors unrelated to
the companies financial performance or prospects. We believe that trading in our stock has been and will likely continue to be
subject to significant volatility. These factors include macroeconomic developments in North America and globally and market perceptions
of the attractiveness of particular industries. Factors unrelated to our performance that may affect the price of our common stock include
the following: the extent of analytical coverage available to investors concerning our business may be limited if investment banks with
research capabilities do not follow us, a reduction in trading volume and general market interest in our common stock may affect an investor s
ability to trade significant numbers of shares of our common stock; the size of our public float may limit the ability of some institutions
to invest in our common stock. As a result of any of these factors, the market price of our common stock at any given point in time may
not accurately reflect our long-term value. The price of our common shares may increase or decrease in response to a number of events
and factors, including: changes in financial estimates; our acquisitions and financings; quarterly variations in our operating results;
the operating and share price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; and purchase or sale of blocks of our
common stock. Any of these factors, may materially adversely affect the prices of our common shares regardless of our operating performance. 

The market price of our common stock is affected
by many other variables which are not directly related to our success and are, therefore, not within our control. These include other
developments that affect the breadth of the public market for shares of our common stock and the attractiveness of alternative investments.
The effect of these and other factors on the market price of our common stock is expected to make our common stock price volatile in the
future, which may result in losses to investors. 

We have not paid any dividends and do not
foresee paying dividends in the future. 

We intend to retain earnings, if any, to finance
the growth and development of our business and do not intend to pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future.
The payment of future cash dividends, if any, will be reviewed periodically by the board of directors and will depend upon, among other
things, conditions then existing including earnings, financial condition and capital requirements, restrictions in financing agreements,
business opportunities and other factors. 

34 

If securities or industry analysts do not
publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding
our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline. 

 The trading market for our common stock will be
influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors.
If any of the analysts who may cover us, adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, or provide more favorable relative
recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of
our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our
stock price or trading volume to decline. 

Cautionary Note 

We have sought to identify what we believe to
be the most significant risks to our business, but we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized nor
can we guarantee that we have identified all possible risks that might arise. Investors should carefully consider all of such risk factors
before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock.

Overview 

Our business model is to develop or acquire unique
medical related products, engage third parties to manufacture such products and then distribute the products through various distribution
channels, including third parties. We plan to develop potentially life-saving technologies: the CardioMap heart monitoring and screening
device, the Save A Life choking rescue device, a unique neurosteroid drug compound intended to treat concussions and a unique drug compound
to treat rare brain disorders in partnership with Prevacus, Inc. To date, none of our product candidates have received regulatory clearance
or approval for commercial sale. 

We plan to license, improve, and develop our products
and identify and select distribution channels. We intend to establish agreements with distributors to get products to market quickly,
and undertake and engage in direct marketing efforts effort as we move closer to regulatory approvals. We will determine the most effective
distribution method for each unique product we include in our portfolio. We will engage third-party research and development firms that
specialize in creating products to assist us in developing our own products, and we will apply for trademarks and patents once we have
developed proprietary products.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The SEC defines critical
accounting policies as those that are, in management s view, important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of
operations and require management s judgment. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are
based on our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expenses. We base our estimates on experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 

Reference is made to our significant accounting
policies set forth in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Results of Operations 

We do not currently sell or market any products
and we did not have any revenue for the years ended July 31, 2023 or 2022. We will commence actively marketing products after the products
and drugs in development have been FDA cleared or approved, but there can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in obtaining
FDA clearance or approval for our products.

In-Process Research and Development 

 In-process research and development in fiscal
2023 relates to the value of the 1,000,000 shares of our common stock with a value of 0.17 per share issued to Prevacus in connection
with the November 2022 Option Agreement. See Note 2. 

Research and Development 

Research and development relates to our current
projects and includes expenses for clinical research, design and manufacturing, formulation, regulatory and consultants. 

The change in Research and development was due
to the following: 

Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 compared to Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2022 
 
 Increase (decrease) in: 

Consultants

 (225,059 
 
 Regulatory 
 (12,100 

(1,115,695 

The decreases in drug development, consultants
and prototype phase were the result of the completion of the development of the concussion drug in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.
The decrease in Phase I clinical trial costs were the result of the completion of dosing patients in the Phase I clinical trial of our
concussion drug device trial in first quarter of fiscal 2023. 

42 

General and Administrative 

General and administrative includes expenses related
to salaries and related benefits for employees in finance, accounting, sales, administrative and research and development activities,
as well as stock-based compensation, costs related to maintaining compliance as a public company and legal and professional fees. 

The change in General and administrative was due
to the following: 

Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 compared to Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2022 
 
 Increase (decrease) in: 

Stock-based compensation 
 297,627 
 
 Business development and investor relations 
 (1,598,381

 (10,004 
 
 Wages 
 (355,191 
 
 Other 
 (1,010 

(1,846,870 

The increase in stock-based compensation was
due to the vesting of restricted stock units and the granting of stock options in fiscal 2023. The decrease in business development
and investor relations was a result of decreased activities related to business development. The decrease in wages was due to the
 400,000 bonus granted to our executive officers in January 2022. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense includes interest on debt outstanding,
as well as the amortization of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt closing costs. Certain information regarding debt outstanding
was as follows: 

Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 

2023 
 2022 
 
 Weighted average debt outstanding 
 2,003,425 
 1,456,991 
 
 Weighted average interest rate 
 7.10 
 7.57 

The increase in weighted average debt outstanding
was due to the issuance of an 870,000 promissory note during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and a 150,000 deposit received on a note
purchase agreement during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. In addition, the increase to the weighted average debt outstanding is due
to the addition of principal to the LGH, ClearThink and Mast Hill notes in exchange for extending the maturity dates on the notes. 

The weighted average interest rate decreased due
to the extension of maturity dates on the LGH and ClearThink notes that have set dollar amounts of interest. 

43 

Other Income, net 

Other income, net in fiscal 2022 included a 500,000
 donation in partnership with the Erase PTSD Now organization and the Glenn Greenberg and Linda Vester
Foundation. Other income, net in both periods included foreign exchange gains and losses related to invoices denominated and paid
in foreign currencies. 

Net Loss 

Net loss decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to
fiscal 2022 due to decreased research and development, general and administrative and interest expense as discussed above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The following table sets forth the primary sources
and uses of cash:

 Net cash provided by financing activities 
 1,449,088 
 2,736,953 

To date, we have financed our operations primarily
through debt financing and limited sales of our common stock. Our ability to continue to access capital could be affected adversely by
various factors, including general market and other economic conditions, interest rates, the perception of our potential future earnings
and cash distributions, any unwillingness on the part of lenders to make loans to us and any deterioration in the financial position of
lenders that might make them unable to meet their obligations to us. If these conditions continue and we cannot raise funds through a
public or private debt financing, or an equity offering, our ability to grow our business may be negatively affected. In such case, we
may need to suspend research and development activities until market conditions improve. 

Cash used in investing activities was for a patent
related to our ONP-002 drug device combination.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Odyssey Health, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Odyssey Health, Inc. (the Company as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended July 31, 2023, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2023 and 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the two years in the period ended July 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

Explanatory Paragraph Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the
Company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and is currently dependent on the stockholders and
lenders to fund its operating activities. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is
a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion
on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

F- 1 

Stock based compensation 

As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements,
the Company entered into certain transactions which included the issuance of options or warrants for goods and services which were valued
using a pricing model. 

We identified the valuation and accounting treatment
of these issuances to be a critical audit matter because determining the fair value and related accounting treatment of these issuances
involves a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort to evaluate the Company s conclusions. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

Our audit procedures related to the conclusions
associated with the valuation and accounting treatment for these issuances involved the following procedures, among others: 

We obtained management s pricing model for the various issuances and tested the significant inputs of the pricing model used to determine the fair value these items. 

We reviewed the underlying agreements supporting these issuances and agreed the terms of the issuances to the pricing model used by management. 

We recomputed management s fair value estimate using a similar pricing model to ensure the output was consistent with management s pricing model output. 

/s/ . 

We have served as the Company s auditor
since 2020.

Odyssey Health, Inc. 

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

as
of July 31, 2023. For the foreseeable future, we expect to experience continuing operating losses and negative cash flows from operations.
Cash available at July 31, 2023 of will not provide enough working capital to meet our current operating expenses through the
first quarter of fiscal 2024. 

The operating deficit and cash balance at July
31, 2023 indicate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our continued existence depends on the success of
our efforts to raise additional capital necessary to meet our obligations as they come due and to obtain sufficient capital to execute
our business plan. We may obtain capital primarily through issuances of debt or equity or entering into collaborative arrangements with
corporate partners. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing additional financing or collaboration transactions
or, if financing is available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing
on a timely basis, we may be required to scale down or perhaps even cease operations. 

The issuance of additional equity securities could
result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans
would be available, would increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. Our financial statements do not include adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

We are continually adjusting our business plan
to reflect our current liquidity expectations. Due to the unknown and volatile nature of the stock price and trading volume of our common
stock, it is difficult to predict the timing and amount of availability pursuant to our equity line of credit with Lincoln Park Capital
Fund, LLC LPC ). Due to the limitations in the equity line of credit, we will need to do one or more of the following during
fiscal 2024; secure additional debt financing, secure additional equity financing, secure a strategic partner, reduce our operating expenditures,
or seek bankruptcy protection. Given our recurring losses, negative cash flow, and accumulated deficit, there is substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern.

Prevacus is a related party, as we are party to a Joint Venture and Intellectual Property Purchase Agreement entered into in June 2019
and its President, Dr. Jacob VanLandingham, is an employee. 

The Milestone Consideration Milestone may be earned by Prevacus as follows: 

(i) 
 2,000,000 shares of our common stock when the United States Patents are revived in our name by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and any international patents that have lapsed also revived in our name by the respective country s patent offices. The value of shares issued were not to exceed 6.0 million based on the price of our common stock on the date the payment would have been due. This milestone will not be met as the relevant patents lapsed; 

(ii) 
 1,000,000 shares of our common stock upon successful first dosing in a Phase I Clinical Trial for the Asset. This milestone was met in March 2022; 

(iii) 
 2,000,000 shares of our common stock upon the grant and issuance to us of a Patent for the Asset from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the value of which shall not exceed 10.0 million based on the price of our common stock on the date the payment is due; 

(iv) 
 1,000,000 shares of our common stock upon our receipt of net proceeds of at least 1.0 million in a Non-Dilutive Financing relating directly to the development of the Asset within one year after the Closing Date or, in the event of any Non-Dilutive Financing submitted prior to the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, the milestone will stay effective until the second year anniversary of the Closing Date. This milestone will not be met as the one-year deadline lapsed; 

(v) 
 2,000,000 shares of our common stock if we sell the Asset to a Third Party resulting in net proceeds to us of at least 50.0 million after a Phase IB Clinical Trial for which we are the sponsor is complete, but prior to completion of a Phase II Clinical Trial. The value of the 2,000,000 shares related to this milestone shall not exceed 25.0 million based on the price of our common stock on the date the payment is due; 

(vi) 
 4,000,000 shares of our common stock upon the successful completion of a Phase II Clinical Trial for the Asset that leads to (I) our sale of the Asset to a Third Party resulting in net proceeds to us of at least 50.0 million; or (II) the administration of the first dose in a Phase III Clinical Trial for the Asset for which we are, or one of our affiliates or licensees is the sponsor; and 

(vii) 
 2,000,000 shares of our common stock after the first dosing in a Phase II Clinical Trial and the successful completion of a Phase 1B human clinical trial. 

All Milestone payments shall only be paid once,
upon the initial achievement of the particular Milestone event. We, at our sole and absolute discretion, shall determine if any Milestone
event has occurred. To extent the related milestones are not achieved, the above-mentioned Milestone payments will terminate and cease
to exist, and we will no longer be liable thereunder, if said Milestone is not completed within four years after the Closing Date. See
Note 5 for additional information. 

On March 1, 2021 (the
 Closing Date ), our APA with Prevacus closed and we issued 6,000,000 shares of our common stock valued at 1.18 per share
for the stock granted on the date of acquisition for . We withheld shares of our common stock valued at 1.18 per
share, for , in exchange for our payment of certain liabilities of Prevacus which was recorded as an Asset purchase liability
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any remaining Asset purchase liability, once all obligations have been paid, will be satisfied with
the release of shares of our common stock at 1.18 per share. 

In addition, shares of our common stock
valued at 1.18 per share for was recorded as a component of Additional Paid in Capital for achievement of the milestone related
to the first dosing in a Phase I Clinical Trial in March 2022. 

We determined that, in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic
730 Research and Development (ASC 730-10-25-2(c)) and pursuant to ASC 730-10-25-2(c), intangibles purchased from others for use in particular
research and development projects and that have no alternative future use in research and development or otherwise, represent costs of
research and development as acquired, and therefore are expensed when incurred. Accordingly, On March 1, 2021, the date of acquisition,
we expensed as In-process research and development. 

Contingent Liabilities 

 At July 31, 2023 and
2022, we had contingent consideration related to the acquisition of intellectual property, know-how and patents for an anti-choking, life-saving

 Effective tax rate 

Our tax provision (benefit) was as follows: 

Increase in valuation allowance 

Total 

Our net deferred tax asset was as follows: 

Valuation allowance 

Net deferred tax asset 

As of July 31, 2023, we had of federal
net operating loss carry forwards. These carry forwards, if not used, will begin to expire in 2039. Current or future ownership changes
may severely limit the future realization of these net operating losses. 

We provide for a valuation allowance when it is
more likely than not that they will not realize a portion of the deferred tax assets. We established a valuation allowance against our
net deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty that enough taxable income will be generated in those taxing jurisdictions to utilize the
assets. Therefore, we have not reflected any benefit from such deferred tax assets in the accompanying financial statements. 

We reviewed the issuance of stock to certain senior
executives who received stock in conjunction with becoming an officer and director. In this case, as an officer and director of a publicly-traded
company, the sale of shares could be subject to the short-swing profits rules of Securities Exchange Act Section 16(b) and is subject
to a substantial risk of forfeiture per IRC 83 (c)(3)(A). Given that such stock is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture,
such stock is treated as nonvested stock under IRC 83. As the stock received was nonvested stock, income inclusion is deferred
until the year in which the stock vests unless the employee makes an affirmative election to include income in the year of receipt. 

We reviewed all income tax positions taken or
that are expected to be taken for all open years and determined that our income tax positions are appropriately stated and supported for
all open years. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years after 2022 due to unexpired net operating
loss carryforwards originating in and subsequent to that year. We may be subject to income tax examinations for the various taxing authorities
which vary by jurisdiction. Our policy is to record interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits as additional income
taxes in the statements of operations. As of July 31, 2023, there were unrecognized tax benefits, or any tax related interest or penalties.

 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management, with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of April 30,
2021. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal
executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.
Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of July 31, 2023, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting
Officer concluded that, as of such date, as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that are
described below in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective. 

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting 

In light of the material weakness described below,
as of July 31, 2023, prior to the filing of this Form 10-K for the period ended July 31, 2023, management determined that key controls
were performed timely and additional procedures were performed, including validating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data
used to support the amounts reported in the financial statements. These control activities and additional procedures have allowed us to
conclude that, notwithstanding the material weaknesses, the financial statements in this Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects,
our financial position, results of operations, statement of shareholder equity and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity
with United States GAAP. 

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. 

Internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. 

Management recognizes that there are inherent
limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, and accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect material misstatements. In addition,
effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration
in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures. 

47 

A material weakness is a significant deficiency,
or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in there being a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of
the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our president and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting,
as of July 31, 2023, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013. Based on our evaluation under this framework, we concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was not effective as of the evaluation date due to the factors stated below. 

Insufficient Resources: We
have an inadequate number of personnel with requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. 

Inadequate Segregation of Duties : We
have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement control procedures. 

We are committed to improving the internal controls
and will (1) continue to use third party specialists to address shortfalls in staffing and to assist us with accounting and finance responsibilities,
(2) increase the frequency of independent reconciliations of significant accounts, which will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties
until there are sufficient personnel, and (3) may consider appointing additional outside directors and audit committee members in the
future. 

We have discussed the material weakness noted
above with our independent registered public accounting firm. Due to the nature of this material weakness, there is a more than remote
likelihood that misstatements, which could be material to the annual or interim financial statements could occur that would not be prevented
or detected. 

This annual report does not include an attestation
report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Our report was not subject to attestation
by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only our report in this annual
report. 

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended July 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

2.1. 
 Buyer s Investment Representations . 

(a) 
 This Agreement is made in reliance upon the Buyer s representation to the Company, which by its acceptance hereof
Buyer hereby confirms, that the Securities to be received by it will be acquired for investment for its own account, not as a nominee
or agent, and not with a view to the sale or distribution of any part thereof, and that it has no present intention of selling, granting
participation in, or otherwise distributing the same, but subject nevertheless to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property
shall at all times be within its control. 

(b) 
 The Buyer understands that the Securities are not registered under the 1933 Act, on the basis that the sale provided for
in this Agreement and the issuance of securities hereunder is exempt from registration under the 1933 Act pursuant to Section 4(a)(2)
thereof, and that the Company s reliance on such exemption is predicated on the Buyer s representations set forth herein.
The Buyer realizes that the basis for the exemption may not be present if, notwithstanding such representations, the Buyer has in mind
merely acquiring shares of the Securities for a fixed or determinable period in the future, or for a market rise, or for sale if the market
does not rise. The Buyer does not have any such intention.

(c) 
 The Buyer understands that the Securities may not be sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of without registration under
the 1933 Act or an exemption therefrom, and that in the absence of an effective registration statement covering the Securities or an available
exemption from registration under the 1933 Act, the Stock must be held indefinitely. In particular, the Buyer is aware that the Securities
may not be sold pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 701 promulgated under the 1933 Act unless all of the conditions of the applicable
Rules are met. Among the conditions for use of Rule 144 is the availability of current information to the public about the Company.
Such information is not now available, and the Company has no present plans to make such information available. The Buyer represents that,
in the absence of an effective registration statement covering the Securities, it will sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the Securities
only in a manner consistent with its representations set forth herein and then only in accordance with the provisions of Section 2(d)
hereof. 

(d) 
 The Buyer agrees that in no event will it make a transfer or disposition of any of the Securities (other than pursuant to
an effective registration statement under the 1933 Act), unless and until (i) the Buyer shall have notified the Company of the proposed
disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a statement of the circumstances surrounding the disposition, and (ii) if requested
by the Company, at the expense of the Buyer or transferee, the Buyer shall have furnished to the Company either (A) an opinion of
counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such transfer may be made without registration under the 1933 Act
or (B) a no action letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the effect that the transfer of such securities
without registration will not result in a recommendation by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that action be taken with
respect thereto. The Company will not require such a legal opinion or no action letter in any transaction in compliance
with Rule 144. 

(e) 
 The Buyer represents and warrants to the Company that it is an accredited investor within the meaning of Securities
and Exchange Commission Rule 501 of Regulation D, as presently in effect and, for the purpose of Section 25102(f) of the

Program, credit such aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled to the Holder's or its designee's
balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system or (B) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the
DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, issue and deliver to the address as specified in the Conversion Notice, a certificate,
registered in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled which
certificates shall not bear any restrictive legends unless required pursuant the Rule 144. If this Note is physically surrendered for
conversion and the outstanding Principal of this Note is greater than the Principal portion of the Conversion Amount being converted,
then the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, as soon as practicable and in no event later than three (3) Business Days after receipt
of this Note and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the holder a new Note representing the outstanding Principal not converted.
The Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of this Note shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock upon the transmission of a Conversion Notice. 

(ii) Company's Failure to Timely Convert . If within five (5) Trading Days after the Company's receipt
of the facsimile or email copy of a Conversion Notice the Company shall fail to issue and deliver to Holder via DWAC/FAST 
electronic transfer the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon such holder's conversion of any Conversion
Amount (a Conversion Failure ), the Original Principal Amount of the Note shall increase by 10 per calendar day until
the Company issues and delivers a certificate to the Holder or credit the Holder's balance account with DTC for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon such holder's conversion of any Conversion Amount (under Holder s and Company s
expectation that any damages will tack back to the Issuance Date). Company will not be subject to any penalties once its transfer agent
processes the shares to the DWAC system. If the Company fails to deliver shares in accordance with the timeframe stated in this Section,
resulting in a Conversion Failure, the Holder, at any time prior to selling all of those shares, may rescind any portion, in whole or
in part, of that particular conversion attributable to the unsold shares and have the rescinded conversion amount returned to the Outstanding
Balance with the rescinded conversion shares returned to the Company (under Holder s and Company s expectations that any returned
conversion amounts will tack back to the original date of the Note).

(iii) Book-Entry . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of any portion
of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless
(A) the full Conversion Amount represented by this Note is being converted or (B) the Holder has provided the Company with prior written
notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting reissuance of this Note upon physical surrender of this Note.
The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Principal and Interest converted and the dates of such conversions or shall
use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon
conversion. 

(c) Limitations on Conversions or Trading . 

(i) Beneficial Ownership . The Company shall not effect any conversions of this Note and the Holder
shall not have the right to convert any portion of this Note or receive shares of Common Stock as payment of interest hereunder to the
extent that after giving effect to such conversion or receipt of such interest payment, the Holder, together with any affiliate thereof,
would beneficially own (as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) in excess
of 4.99 of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion or receipt of shares as
payment of interest. Since the Holder will not be obligated to report to the Company the number of shares of Common Stock it may hold
at the time of a conversion hereunder, unless the conversion at issue would result in the issuance of shares of Common Stock in excess
of 4.99 of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock without regard to any other shares which may be beneficially owned by the Holder
or an affiliate thereof, the Holder shall have the authority and obligation to determine whether the restriction contained in this Section
will limit any particular conversion hereunder and to the extent that the Holder determines that the limitation contained in this Section
applies, the determination of which portion of the principal amount of this Note is convertible shall be the responsibility and obligation
of the Holder. If the Holder has delivered a Conversion Notice for a principal amount of this Note that, without regard to any other shares
that the Holder or its affiliates may beneficially own, would result in the issuance in excess of the permitted amount hereunder, the
Company shall notify the Holder of this fact and shall honor the conversion for the maximum principal amount permitted to be converted
on such Conversion Date in accordance with Section 3(a) and, any principal amount tendered for conversion in excess of the permitted amount
hereunder shall remain outstanding under this Note. In the event that the Market Capitalization of the Company falls below 2,500,000,
the term 4.99 above shall be permanently replaced with 9.99 . Market Capitalization shall be
defined as the product of (a) the closing price of the Common Stock of the Common stock multiplied by (b) the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding as reported on the Company s most recently filed Form 10-K or Form 10-Q. The provisions of this Section may be
waived by Holder upon not less than sixty-five (65) days prior written notification to the Company. 

(ii) Capitalization. So long as this as this Note is outstanding, upon written request of the Holder,
the Company shall furnish to the Holder the then-current number of common shares issued and outstanding, the then-current number of common
shares authorized, and the then-current number of shares reserved for third parties. 

(d) Other Provisions . 

(i) Share Reservation. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized
Common Stock a number of shares equal to at least the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding
amounts under this Note; and within three (3) Business Days following the receipt by the Company of a Holder's notice that such minimum
number of shares of Common Stock is not so reserved, the Company shall promptly reserve a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock
to comply with such requirement. The Company will at all times reserve at least 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock for conversion. 

10 

(ii) Prepayment. The Company may prepay this Note at any time by providing Holder notice of its intent
to prepay the outstanding amounts due under the Note (the Prepayment Notice ). The Company shall tender the full amount in
the Prepayment Notice by paying one hundred percent (100 of the total outstanding balance including all principal, defaults and interest.
to the Holder within five (5) trading days of delivering the Prepayment Notice to the Holder. 

(iii) All calculations under this Section 3 shall be rounded up to the nearest 0.00001 or whole share.

 CONSENT OF TURNER, STONE AND COMPANY, LLP

Exhibit 23.1 

Your Vision Our Focus 

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Odyssey Health,
Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Odyssey Health, Inc. (the company as of July 31, 2023, and 2022, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flow for each of the two years in the period ended July 31, 2023, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2023, and 2022, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended July 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. 

Explanatory Paragraph 
Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company
has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and is currently dependent on the stockholders and lenders
to fund operating activities. Management s plan in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the
responsibility of the entity s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

1 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters
arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee
and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements,
taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit
matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Stock-based compensation 

As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements,
the Company entered into certain transactions which included the issuance of options or warrants for goods and services which were valued
using a pricing model. 

We identified the valuation and
accounting treatment of these issuances to be critical audit matter because determining the fair value and related accounting treatment
of these issuances involves a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent of effort to evaluate the Company s conclusions. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in
the Audit 

Our audit procedures related to
the conclusions associated with the valuation and accounting treatment for these issuances involved the following procedures, among others: 

We obtained management s pricing model for the various issuances and tested the significant inputs
of the pricing model used to determine the fair value of these items. 

We reviewed the underlying agreements supporting these issuances and agreed the terms of the issuances
to the pricing used by management. 

We recomputed management s fair value estimate using a similar
pricing model to ensure the output was consistent with management s pricing model output. 

We have served as the Company's auditor since 2020.
