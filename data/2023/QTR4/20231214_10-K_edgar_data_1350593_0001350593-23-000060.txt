Our iron gate valve or fire hydrant products are specified for use in the largest 100 metropolitan areas in the United States. Our large installed base, broad product range and well-known brands have led to long-standing relationships with the key distributors and end users of our products. Our consolidated net sales were 1,275.7 million in 2023. 
 
 We operate our business through two segments, Water Flow Solutions and Water Management Solutions. Segment sales, operating results and additional financial data and commentary are provided in the Segment Analysis section in Part II, Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS and in Note 14. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA of this Annual Report. 
 Organization Updates 
 Effective October 1, 2021, we implemented a new management structure designed to increase revenue growth, drive operational excellence, accelerate new product development and enhance profitability. Our two operating segments, Water Flow Solutions and Water Management Solutions, align with this management structure. 
 Effective August 21, 2023, the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO left his role and Marietta Edmunds Zakas, the Company s Chief Financial Officer CFO was named President and CEO. Steven S. Heinrichs, the Company s Chief Legal and Compliance Officer, was named CFO, and continues to serve as Chief Legal and Compliance Officer. In addition, certain other management changes occurred. As a result, the Company incurred transition and retention expense which has been recorded to Strategic reorganization and other charges in our consolidated statements of operation s. 
 
 Water Flow Solutions 
 The Water Flow Solutions product portfolio includes iron gate valves, specialty valves and service brass products. Net sales of products in the Water Flow Solutions business unit were approximately 50 of fiscal 2023 consolidated net sales. 
 
 Water Management Solutions 
 The Water Management Solutions product and service portfolio includes fire hydrants, repair and installation, natural gas, metering, leak detection, and pressure management and control products and solutions. Net sales of products and services in the Water Management Solutions business unit were approximately 50 of fiscal 2023 consolidated net sales. 

Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to capitalize on the large, attractive and growing water infrastructure markets worldwide. Key elements of this strategy are as follows: 
 Drive operational improvements and deliver benefits from capital investments. 
 We seek to bring best practices focused on Lean manufacturing and Six Sigma business process improvement methodologi es, with an investment mindset to deliver manufacturing productivity improvements. We expect these efforts will drive sales growth, improve product margins, and facilitate innovation and new product development. Productivity improvements within our facilities should allow us to lower costs, which can help fund additional manufacturing initiatives and continued investment in product development. 
 Over the past five years, we have prioritized capital investments to modernize our manufacturing facilities and processes, expand capacity and capabilities for domestic manufacturing and accelerate new product development. We believe these i nvestments will drive margin expansion by lowering costs, expand our product portfolio, and improve product quality. We have completed our large valve manufacturing expansion in Chattanooga, Tennessee and our new facility in Kimball,

Tennessee, which included consolidating multiple facilities. We expect these investments to support our domestic manufacturing capabilities for specialty and large valves and to capitalize on the growing need for highly engineered valves required for water infrastructure projects. During 2023, we started initial production at a new brass foundry in Decatur, Illinois, which will eventually replace our original brass foundry built there in the early 1900s. These three projects accounted for a significant portion of our capital expenditures over the past five years. They are expected to drive operational efficiencies, expand capabilities for American-made products, advance our sustainability environmental initiatives, and help accelerate product development. 
 Accelerate product development and innovation. 
 We plan to continue to invest in our product development capabilities, including expanding our research and development staff, to develop and market new products and services. We expect to add new products to our portfolio and offer new products in different end markets. We continue to enhance our software platform, Sentryx , which provides data intelligence to help water utilities make strategic and operational decisions. This data includes leak detection, pressure monitoring, advanced metering and water quality metrics, which are aggregated and consolidated within the Sentryx platform, providing utilities with critical information to monitor and control their water networks. As our customers seek to use real-time data and analytics to manage and repair their aging pipe networks more efficiently, we believe we are well-positioned to provide solutions given our expertise and the large installed base of our products. 
 Execute sales initiatives and channel strategies to enhance customer service and increase growth. 
 While our distribution network covers all of the major locations for our principal products in the United States and Canada, we want to continue to invest in process improvements to support our objective of being the preferred partner for our customers. Expanding the capabilities of our systems and employees will allow us to improve our customers experiences. We continue to invest time and resources to deepen our channel partnerships and end customer relationships to increase our presence in the fastest growing markets. Additionally, we seek to attract and retain customers through product training and engineering resources to ascertain, educate and understand project requirements. 
 Continue to seek, acquire, and invest in businesses and technologies that expand our existing portfolio or allow us to enter new markets. 
 We will continue to evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses, technologies and product lines that have the potential to strengthen our competitive position, enhance or expand our existing product and service offerings, expand our technological capabilities, leverage our manufacturing capabilities, provide synergistic opportunities, enhance our customer relationships or allow us to enter new markets. As part of this strategy, we may pursue international opportunities, including acquisitions, joint ventures and partnerships.

Water Valves and Related Products. Water Flow Solutions manufactures valves for water systems, including iron gate, butterfly, tapping, check, knife, plug, and ball valves, and sells these products under a variety of brand names, including Mueller , Pratt , and U.S. Pipe Valve and Hydrant. These valve products are used to control distribution and transmission of potable water and non-potable water. Water valve products typically range in size from inch to 36 inches in diameter. Water Flow Solutions also manufactures significantly larger valves as custom orders through some of its product lines. Most of these valves are used in water transmission or distribution, water treatment facilities or industrial applications. 
 Water Management Solutions 
 Water Management Solutions portfolio includes fire hydrants, repair and installation, natural gas, metering, leak detection and pressure management and control products and solutions. We recognized 641.3 million, 533.3 million and 493.2 million of net sales in our 2023, 2022, and 2021 fiscal years respectively, for Water Management Solutions products and solutions. 
 
 Fire Hydrants. Water Management Solutions manufactures dry-barrel and wet-barrel fire hydrants. Water Management Solutions sells fire hydrants for new water infrastructure development, fire protection systems and water infrastructure repair and replacement projects. 
 Our fire hydrants consist of an upper barrel and nozzle section and a lower barrel and valve section that connects to a water main. In dry-barrel fire hydrants, the valve connecting the barrel of the hydrant to the water main is located below ground at or below the frost line, which keeps the upper barrel dry. Water Management Solutions sells dry-barrel fire hydrants under the Mueller and U.S. Pipe Valve and Hydrant brand names in the United States and Mueller and the Canada Valve brand names in Canada. Water Management Solutions also makes wet-barrel fire hydrants, where the valves are located in the hydrant nozzles and the barrel contains water at all times. Wet-barrel fire hydrants are made for warm weather climates, such as in California and Hawaii, and are sold under the Jones brand name. 
 Most municipalities have approved a limited number of fire hydrant brands for installation as a result of their desire to use the same tools and operating instructions across their systems and to minimize inventories of spare parts. We believe the large installed base of Mueller fire hydrants throughout the United States and Canada, reputation for superior quality and performance as well as specified position have contributed to the leading market position of our fire hydrants. This large installed base also leads to recurring sales of replacement fire hydrants and hydrant parts. 
 Repair Products and Services. Water Management Solutions also sells pipe repair products, such as couplings, grips and clamps used to repair leaks, under the HYMAX , Mueller and Krausz brand names. 
 Water Metering Products and Systems . Water Management Solutions manufactures and sources a variety of water technology products under the Mueller brand name that are designed to help water providers accurately measure and control water usage. Water Management Solutions offers a complete lin e of residential, fire protection and commercial metering solutions. Residential and commercial water meters are generally classified as either manually read meters or remotely read meters via radio technology. A manually read meter consists of a water meter and a register that gives a visual meter reading display. Meters equipped with radio transmitters (endpoints) use encoder registers to convert the measurement data from the meter (mechanical or static) into an encrypted digital format which is then transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility billing systems. These remotely or electronically read systems are either automatic meter reading AMR systems or fixed network advanced metering infrastructure AMI systems. With an AMR system, utility personnel with mobile equipment, including a radio receiver, computer and reading software, collect the data from utilities meters. With an AMI system, a network of permanent data collectors or gateway receivers that are always active or listening for the radio transmission from the utilities meters gather the data. AMI systems eliminate the need for utility personnel to travel through service territories to collect meter reading data. These systems provide the utilities with more frequent and diverse data at specified intervals from the utilities meters and allow for two-way communication. Water Management Solutions sells both AMR and AMI systems and related products. Our remote disconnect water meter enables the water flow to be stopped and started remotely via handheld devices or from a central operating facility. 
 Water Leak Detection and Pipe Condition Assessment Products and Services . Water Management Solutions develops technologies and offers products and services under the Echologics brand name that can non-invasively (i.e., without disrupting service or introducing a foreign object into the water system) detect underground leaks and assess the condition of water mains comprised of a variety of materials. We leverage our proprietary acoustic technology to offer leak detection and condition assessment surveys. We also offer fixed leak detection systems that allow customers to continuously monitor and detect leaks on water distribution and transmission mains. We believe Water Management Solutions ability to offer non-invasive leak detection and pipe condition assessment services is a key competitive advantage.

Additionally, Water Management Solutions produces machines and tools for tapping, drilling, extracting, installing and stopping-off, which are designed to work with its water and gas fittings and valves as an integrated system. We also provide gas valve products primarily for use in gas distribution systems. With our Singer Valve and i2O products, we provide a range of intelligent water solutions including pressure control valves, advanced pressure management, network analytics, event management and data logging. 

Manufacturing 
 See Item 2. PROPERTIES for a description of our principal manufacturing facilities. 
 We will continue to expand the use of Lean manufacturing and Six Sigma business process improvement methodologies where appropriate to safely capture higher levels of quality, service and operational efficiency in our manufacturing facilities in both segments. 
 Mueller Water Products operates ten manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Israel and China. These manufacturing operations include foundry, machining, fabrication, assembly, testing and painting operations. Not all facilities perform each of these operations. Our existing manufacturing capacity is sufficient for anticipated near-term requirements. In order to meet longer-term capacity requirements and modernize some production facilities, we have expanded the large valve casting capabilities at the facility located in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and added a new facility nearby in Kimball, Tennessee to expa nd domestic manufacturing capabilities for specialty large valves. Additionally, our new brass foundry in Decatur, Illinois, is nearly complete and will replace our existing brass foundry there. Our foundries use both lost foam and green sand casting techniques. We use the lost foam technique for fire hydrant production in our Albertville, Alabama facility and for iron gate valve production in our Chattanooga, Tennessee facility. The lost foam technique has several advantages over the green sand technique, especially for high-volume products, including a reduction in the number of manual finishing operations, lower scrap levels and the ability to reuse some of the materials. 
 
 Additionally, we design, manufacture, and assemble water metering products in Cleveland, North Carolina. In Atlanta, Georgia, we design and support AMR and AMI systems in our research and development center of excellence for software and electronics. Our research and development center in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, designs and supports leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and solutions. Product design and support for our intelligent water solutions products and services for pressure management are in Southampton, United Kingdom. 

Purchased Components and Raw Materials 
 Our products are made using various purchased components and seve ral basic raw materials that include brass ingot, scrap steel, sand and resin. Purchased parts and raw materials represented approximatel y 45 and 11 , respectively, of Cost of sales in 2023. 

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks 
 We have active patents relating to the design of our products and trademarks for our brands and products. We have filed and continue to file when appropriate, patent applications used in connection with our business and products. Many of the patents for technology underlying the majority of our products have been in the public domain for many years, and we do not believe third-party patents individually or in the aggregate are material to our business. However, we consider the pool of proprietary information, consisting of expertise and trade secrets relating to the design, manufacture and operation of our products to be particularly important and valuable. We generally own the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell, and we are not dependent in any material way upon any third-party license or franchise to operate. See Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Any inability to protect our intellectual property or our failure to effectively defend against intellectual property infringement claims could adversely affect our competitive position.

Seasonality 
 Parts of our business depend upon construction activity, which is seasonal in many areas as a result of the impact of cold weather conditions on construction. Net sales and operating income have historically been lowest in the quarters ending December 31 and March 31 when the northern United States and most of Canada generally face weather conditions that restrict significant construction and other field crew activity. See Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Seasonal demand for certain of our products and services may adversely affect our financial results. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 We primarily sell to national and regional waterworks distributors in the U.S. and Canada. Our distributor relationships are generally non-exclusive, but we attempt to align ourselves with key distributors in the principal markets we serve. We believe Mueller is the most recognized brand in the United States water infrastructure industry. Our extensive installed base, broad product range and well-known brands have led to many long-standing relationships with the key distributors in the principal markets we serve. Our distribution network covers all of the major locations for our principal products in the United States and Canada. Although we have long-standing relationships with most of our key distributors, we typically do not have long-term contracts with them, including our two largest distributors, which together accounted for approximat ely 35 , 40 and 39 of our gross sales in 2023, 2022 and 2021 fiscal years, respectively . See Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Our business depends on a small group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales. 
 Water Flow Solutions 
 Water Flow Solutions sells its products primarily through waterworks distributors to a wide variety of end user customers, including water and wastewater utilities, and fire protection and constructi on contractors. Sales of the products are heavily influenced by the specifications for the underlying projects. Approximately 6 of Water Flow Solutions net sales were to Canadian customers in our fiscal year 2023, 8 in fiscal year 2022 and 7 in fiscal year 2021. 
 Water Management Solutions 
 Water Management Solutions sells its products primarily through waterworks distributors to a wide variety of end user customers, including water and wastewater utilities, gas utilities, integrated suppliers, as well as fire protection and construction contractors. Sales of our products are heavily influenced by the specifications for the underlying projects. Water Management Solutions also sells its water metering, leak detection, including pipe condition assessment, and pressure management and control products and solutions directly to municipalities and to waterworks distributors. Approximate ly 6 of Water Management Solutions net sales were to Canadian customers in fiscal year 2023, 7 in fiscal year 2022 and 8 in fiscal year 2021.

Backlog 
 We consider backlog to represent orders placed by customers for which goods or services have yet to be shipped. Backlog is a meaningful indicator for many of our product lines. The delivery lead time for certain product lines such as specialty valves can be longer than one year, and we expect approximately 22 of Water Flow Solutions backlog at the end of 2023 will not be shipped until beyond 2024. Water Management Solutions manufactures or sources water meter systems that are sometimes ordered in large quantities with delivery dates over several years. We expect approximately 2 of Water Management Solutions backlog at the end of 2023 will not be shipped until beyond 2024. Due to higher demand levels in 2022, we experienced record levels of short-cycle backlog, primarily for our iron gate valves, service brass products and fire hydrants. Backlog for Water Management Solutions and Water Flow Solutions are as follows: 
 
 September 30, 2023 2022 (in millions) Water Flow Solutions 232.0 419.1 Water Management Solutions 93.5 309.8 Total backlog 325.5 728.9 
 
 Sales cycles for metering systems can span several years, and it is common for customers to place orders throughout the contract period. Although we believe we have a common understanding with our customer as to the total value of a contract when it is awarded, we do not include customer orders in our backlog until the customer order is received. 

Competition 
 The United States and Canadian markets for water infrastructure and flow control products are very competitive. See Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. There are only a few competitors for most of our product and service offerings. Many of our competitors are well-established companies with products that have strong brand recognition. We consider our installed base, product quality, customer service level, brand recognition, innovation, distribution and technical support to be competitive strengths. 
 The competitive environment for most of Water Flow Solutions valve products is mature and many end users are slow to transition to brands other than their historically preferred brands making it difficult to increase market share in this environment. We believe our valves enjoy strong competitive positions based primarily on the extent of their installed base, product quality, specified position and brand recognition. Our principal competitors for iron gate valves are McWane, Inc. and American Cast Iron Pipe Company. The primary competitors for our service brass products are The Ford Meter Box Company, Inc. and A.Y. McDonald Mfg. Co. Many service brass valves are interchangeable among different manufacturers. For our specialty valve products such as butterfly, plug, and check valves, our principal competitors are DeZURIK, Val-Matic and McWane, Inc. 
 The markets for products and services sold by Water Management Solutions are very competitive, with some mature products, and many end users are slow to transition to brands other than their historically preferred brands. We believe that our fire hydrants enjoy a strong competitive position primarily based on the extent of their installed base, product quality, specified position and brand recognition. Our principal competitors for fire hydrants are McWane, Inc. and American Cast Iron Pipe Company. We believe the markets for many of our repair products are open to product innovation. For our pipe repair products, we believe our brand names, including Krausz and HYMAX , are generally associated with premium products as a result of our patented technology and superior features. Our current marketing strategy is primarily focused on repair, joining and restraining of water infrastructure piping systems, which consists of cast iron, ductile iron and plastic pipe. Our repair solutions work well with all of these. Our primary competitors in the repair market are Romac Industries, Smith Blair, Viking Johnson, AVK Group, JCM Industries, and Georg Fisher Ltd. 
 
 Water Management Solutions sells water metering products and systems, primarily in the United States. We believe a substantial portion of this market is in the process of transitioning from manually read meters to electronically read meters; however, we expect this transition to be relatively slow and that many end users will be reluctant to adopt brands other than their historically preferred brand. Although Water Management Solutions market position is relatively small, we believe our 
 6

electronically read meters and associated technology are positioned to gain a greater share of these markets. Our principal competitors are Sensus, Neptune Technology Group Inc., Badger Meter, Inc., Itron, Inc., and Master Meter, Inc. We also sell pressure control valves and pressure loggers through our Singer Valve and i2O products. The primary competitors for these products are Cla-Val, Watts, OCV, Ross Valve, Bermad and Halma. Water Management Solutions also sells water leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services in North America, the United Kingdom and select countries in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, with our primary markets being the United States and Canada. The worldwide market for leak detection and pipe condition assessment is highly fragmented with numerous competitors. Our more significant competitors are Pure Technologies Ltd., Gutermann AG and Syrinix Ltd. Additionally, we sell gas repair products which are primarily used on distribution lines. Our primary competitors for these products are Smith Blair, T.D. Williamson, and A.Y. McDonald. 

Research and Development 
 Our primary research and development R D facilities are located in Chattanooga, Tennessee; Ariel, Israel; Atlanta, Georgia; Toronto, Ontario; and Southampton, United Kingdom. The primary focus of these operations is to develop new products, improve and refine existing products and obtain and assure compliance with industry approval certifications or standards, such as AWWA, UL, FM, NSF and The Public Health and Safety Company. R D expenses were 25.9 million, 24.5 million and 17.1 million during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Regulatory and Environmental Matters 
 Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the United States, in areas such as: competition, government contracts, international trade, labor and employment, tax, licensing, consumer protection, environmental protection, workplace health and safety, and others. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business, and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our operations, both favorably and unfavorably. For example, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA and similar state laws affect our operations by, among other things, imposing investigation and cleanup requirements for threatened or actual releases of hazardous substances. Under CERCLA, joint and several liability may be imposed on operators, generators, site owners, lessees and others regardless of fault or the legality of the original activity that caused or resulted in the release of the hazardous substances. Thus, we may be subject to liability under CERCLA and similar state laws for properties that: (1) we currently own, lease or operate; (2) we, our predecessors, or former subsidiaries previously owned, leased or operated; (3) sites to which we, our predecessors or former subsidiaries sent waste materials; and (4) sites at which hazardous substances from our facilities operations have otherwise come to be located. The purchaser of U.S. Pipe has been identified as a potentially responsible party PRP under CERCLA in connection with a former manufacturing facility operated by U.S. Pipe that was in the vicinity of a Superfund site located in North Birmingham, Alabama. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement relating to our sale of U.S. Pipe, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain environmental liabilities, including those arising out of the former manufacturing site in North Birmingham. Accordingly, the purchaser tendered the matter to us for indemnification, which we accepted. Ultimate liability for the site will depend on many factors that have not yet been determined, including the determination of the Environmental Protection Agency s EPA remediation costs, the number and financial viability of the other PRPs (there are three other PRPs currently) and the determination of the final allocation of the costs among the PRPs. For more information regarding this matter as well as others that may affect our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, see Item 1A. RISK FACTORS, Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Contingencies and Note 15. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to various environmental, health and safety matters. We believe our operations are in compliance with, or we are taking actions designed to reinforce compliance with, these laws, regulations and ordinances. However, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of claims concerning non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws or standards, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with those claims. Except for certain orders issued by environmental, health and safety regulatory agencies, with which we believe we are in compliance and which we believe are immaterial to our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, we are not currently named as a party in any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to environmental, health and safety matters. 
 
 Greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions have increasingly become the subject of political and regulatory focus. Concern over potential climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting GHG emissions. In addition to certain federal proposals in the United States to regulate GHG emissions, many states and countries are considering and are enacting GHG legislation, regulations or international accords, either individually and/or as part of 
 7 

Table of Contents 
 Index to Financial Statements 

regional initiatives. It is likely that additional climate change related mandates will be forthcoming, and it is expected that they may adversely impact our costs by increasing energy costs and raw material prices, requiring operational or equipment modifications to reduce emissions and creating costs to comply with regulations or to mitigate the financial consequences of such compliance. 
 
 Our environmental strategy focuses on responsible sourcing and manufacturing sustainable products that address numerous water infrastructure challenges. We have established reduction targets for key environmental performance indicators such as GHG emissions, internal water withdrawal intensity and waste to landfill, as well as targets for increased use of recycled materials in our products. In connection with these efforts, we work to minimize the amount of water we use at our manufacturing facilities and maintain stringent water quality standards. Our processes are designed to return the water used in manufacturing at a quality level that does not negatively impact the receiving environment. 
 
 Future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, new legislation to limit GHG emissions or contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by us, including currently unknown contamination and contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or other waste generators, may give rise to additional costs which could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
 
 Our anticipated capital expenditures for environmental projects are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

Human Capital 
 We believe our employees are our greatest asset and we strive to provide a safe, inclusive, high-performance culture where our people can thrive. We strive to recruit, develop, engage, train and protect our workforce. The following are key human capital measures and objectives on which the Company currently focuses. 
 Core Values. Our core values of respect, integrity, trust, safety and inclusion shape our culture and define who we are. We are committed to upholding fundamental human rights and believe that all human beings should be treated with dignity, fairness, and respect. 
 Employee Total Compensation and Benefits Philosophy. We pay at or above a living wage at each of our locations. Living wage is defined as the minimum necessary income for a worker to meet the worker s basic needs, which can fluctuate based on physical location and other local factors. We base our calculations on a single worker with no children. We are dedicated to our employees health and well-being. We provide access to benefits and offer programs that support work-life balance and overall well-being, including financial, physical and mental health resources, such as those listed below.

We condemn human rights abuses and do not condone the use of slave or forced labor, human trafficking, child labor, the degrading treatment of individuals, physical punishment, or unsafe working conditions. 
 
 All employees are required to understand and obey local laws, to report any suspected violations, and to act in accordance with our Core Values and Code of Conduct. 
 
 We concluded a comprehensive pay equity analysis in 2021 encompassing all staff members and job levels in addition to considering gender and race. We believe we have made compensation adjustments to rectify compensation disparities. We also implemented hiring and promotional practices to support our goal of ensuring offers to new employees or to employees being promoted internally are aligned with the market and equitable on an internal basis. We plan to conduct another comprehensive pay equity analysis in the near future and at appropriate intervals going forward. 
 
 In our fiscal year 2022, we expanded our Diversity and Inclusion D I Council framework to include a series of councils including an executive council, a company-wide employee council and local employee councils at each plant as well as a corporate and sales team council. 
 
 Talent Acquisition and Retention. We strive to attract, develop and retain high-performing talent, and we support and reward employee performance. Programs to strengthen our talent include an employee referral program, tuition reimbursement, continued training and development and succession planning. We also have partnerships with local and national educational institutions for our recruiting efforts. We prioritize employee engagement and transparency by implementing programs and processes to ensure our employees have opportunities to ask questions, voice concerns, and share feedback. This is accomplished in part by conducting an annual employee satisfaction survey, and quarterly town hall meetings. Our fiscal year 2023 employee turnover rate was approximately 36 . 
 
 Leadership and Culture Development. As new generations enter the workforce, their dedication to sustainability is pivotal for our long-term prosperity. The Mueller Development Program MDP has been developed to create a pathway for upcoming talent. In 2022, we extended our Frontline Leader training program, offering resources in time management, communication, team building, and personal coaching. 
 
 At September 30, 2023, we employed approximately 3,200 people, of whom 81 work in the United States. At September 30, 2023, approximately of our United States hourly workforce was represented by collective bargaining agreements. Additionally, certain foreign countries where we have employees, such as China, provide by law for employee rights which include requirements similar to collective bargaining agreements. We believe we have good relations with our employees, including those represented by collective bargaining agreements. 
 We have successfully negotiated and extended several of our collective bargaining agreeme nts in the past. Our locations with employees covered by such agreements are presented below.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Risks related to our industries 
 A significant portion of our business depends on spending for water and wastewater infrastructure construction activity. 
 Our primary end markets are repair and replacement of water infrastructure, driven by municipal spending and new water infrastructure installation driven by new residential construction. As a result, a significant portion of our business depends on local, state and federal spending on water and wastewater infrastructure upgrade, repair and replacement. Funds for water and wastewater infrastructure repair and replacement typically come from local taxes, water fees and water rates. State and local governments and private water entities that do not adequately budget for expenditures when setting tax rates, water rates and water fees, as applicable, could be unable to pay for water infrastructure repair and replacement if they do not have access to other funding sources. In addition, reductions or delays in federal spending related to water or wastewater infrastructure could adversely affect state or local projects and thus may adversely affect our financial results. 
 Governments and private water entities may have limited abilities to increase taxes, water fees or water rates, as applicable. It is not unusual for water and wastewater projects to be delayed and rescheduled for a number of reasons, including changes in project priorities, increasing interest rates, inflation and difficulties in complying with environmental and other governmental regulations. For example, changes in interest rates and credit markets, including municipal bonds, mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit, have in the past and may in the future significantly increase the costs of the projects in which our products are utilized, such as in new residential construction and water and wastewater infrastructure upgrade, repair and replacement projects, and lead to such projects being reduced, delayed and/or rescheduled, which could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings and adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, higher interest rates are often accompanied by inflation. We have in the past and may in the future be unable to raise the prices of our products sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins and cash flows. 
 Some state and local governments may place significant restrictions on the use of water by their constituents and/or increase their water conservation efforts. These types of water use restrictions and water conservation efforts may lead to reduced water revenues by private water entities, municipalities or other governmental agencies, which could similarly affect funding decisions for water-related projects. 
 Poor economic conditions may cause states, municipalities or private water entities to receive lower than anticipated revenues, which may lead to reduced or delayed funding for water infrastructure projects. Even if favorable economic conditions exist, water infrastructure owners may choose not to address deferred infrastructure needs as a result of a variety of political factors or competing spending priorities. 
 
 Low levels of spending for water and wastewater infrastructure construction activity could adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flows. 
 Residential construction activity is important to our business and adverse conditions or sustained uncertainty within this market could adversely affect our financial results. 
 New water and wastewater infrastructure spending is heavily dependent upon residential construction. As a result, our financial performance depends significantly on the stability and growth of the residential construction market. This market depends on a variety of factors beyond our control, including household formation, consumer confidence, interest rates, inflation and the availability of mortgage financing, as well as the mix between single and multifamily construction, availability of construction labor and ultimately the extent to which new construction leads to the development of raw land. Adverse conditions or sustained uncertainty regarding the residential construction market have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on our sales, profitability and cash flows, including the risk that one or more of our distributors and/or end use customers decide to delay purchasing, or determine not to purchase, our products or services. 
 Our business depends on a small group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales. 
 A majority of our products are sold primarily to distributors and our success depends on these third parties operating their businesses profitably and effectively. These distributors profitability and effectiveness can vary significantly from company to company and from region to region within the same company. Further, our largest distributors generally also carry competing products. We may fail to align our operations with successful distributors in any given market. 
 Distributors in our industry have experienced consolidation in recent years. If such consolidation continues, our distributors could be acquired by other distributors who have better relationships with our competitors, and consequently, 
 11 

Table of Contents 
 Index to Financial Statements 

pricing and profit margin pressure may intensify. Pricing and profit margin pressure or the loss of any one of our key distributors in any market could adversely affect our operating results. 
 Certain products and solutions, primarily technology-enabled products and solutions as well as gas repair products, are sold directly to end users. Some of these customers represent a relatively high concentration of sales. Over time, expected growth in sales is expected to lessen the significance of individual customers. In the short term, net sales could decline if existing significant customers do not continue to purchase our products or services and new customers are not obtained to replace them. 
 Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 The United States and Canadian markets for water infrastructure and flow control products are very competitive. While there are only a few competitors for most of our product and service offerings, many of our competitors are well-established companies with strong brand recognition. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including the quality, price and innovation of our products, services and service levels, and product specifications and availability. Our ability to retain customers in the face of competition depends on our ability to market our products and services to our customers and end users effectively. 
 The United States markets for water metering products and systems are highly competitive. Our primary competitors benefit from strong market positions and many end users are slow to transition to new products or new brands. Our ability to attract new customers depends on our technological advancements and ability to market our products and services to our customers and end users effectively. 
 In addition to competition from North American companies, we face the threat of competition from outside of North America. The intensity of competition from these companies is affected by fluctuations in the value of the United States dollar against foreign local currencies, the cost to ship competitive products into North America and the availability of trade remedies, if any. Competition may also increase as a result of competitors located in the United States shifting their operations to lower-cost countries or otherwise reducing their costs. 
 Our competitors may reduce the prices of their products or services, improve their quality, improve their functionality or enhance their marketing or sales activities. Any of these potential developments could adversely affect our prices and demand for our products and services. 
 The long-term success of our newer systems and solutions, including the related products, software and services, such as smart metering, leak detection, pressure monitoring and pipe condition assessment, depends on market acceptance. 
 Our technology-enabled smart metering, leak detection, pressure monitoring and pipe condition assessment products and services have much less market history than many of our traditional products. Our investments in smart metering have primarily focused on the market for AMI and have been based on our belief that water utilities will transition over time from traditional manually-read meters to automatically-read meters. The market for AMI continues to evolve, and the United States markets for water meter products and systems are highly competitive. Water utilities have traditionally been slow adopters of new technology and may not adopt AMI as quickly as we expect, partially as a result of the substantial investment related to installation of AMI systems. The strong market positions of our primary competitors may also slow the adoption of our products. Similarly, the adoption of our pressure monitoring, leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services depends on the willingness of our customers to invest in new product and service offering s, and the pace of adoption may be slower than we expe ct. The markets for our technology-enabled products and services have developed more slowly than we expected and may continue to do so. If these products and services fail to gain market acceptance, our opportunity to grow these businesses will be limited.

Risks related to our business strategy 
 We may not be able to adequately manage the risks associated with installed products and the introduction and deployment of new products and systems, including increased warranty costs. 
 The success of our existing and new products and systems, such as our smart hydrant and Sentryx software platform, will depend on our ability to manage the risks associated with their introduction and continued maintenance and management, including the risk that existing and new products and systems may have quality or other defects or deficiencies that result in their failure to satisfy performance or reliability requirements. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage these risks, including costs associated with design, manufacturing, installation, maintenance and warranties. These challenges can be costly and technologically challenging, and we cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect they may have. Warranty liabilities and the related reserve estimation process is highly judgmental as a result of the complex nature of these exposures and the unique circumstances of each claim. Furthermore, once claims are asserted for an alleged product defect by customers, it can be difficult to determine the level of potential exposure or liability related to such allegation to which the assertion of these claims may expand geographically. Although we have obtained insurance for certain product related claims, such policies may not be available to us or adequately cover the liability for damages, the cost of repairs and/or the expense of litigation. Current and future claims may arise out of events or circumstances not covered by insurance and not subject to effective indemnification agreements with our subcontractors. Failure to successfully manage these challenges could result in lost sales, significant expense, and harm to our reputation. 
 Our products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the business and result in harm to our reputation. 
 We offer several technologically enhanced, complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Unanticipated defects can also exist in components and products we purchase from third parties. Component defects could make our products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. In addition, our offerings can have quality issues and from time-to-time experience outages, disruptions, slowdowns or errors. As a result, our products and services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services we offer. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting our offerings. In addition, we can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for our customers and result in harm to our reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, new product and service introduction delays and lost sales. 
 Inefficient or ineffective allocation of capital, along with increased capital expenditure levels to modernize our aging facilities and expand our capabilities, could adversely affect our operating results and/or stockholder value, including a negative impact on our available cash reserves and prevent acquisition or other cash-intensive opportunities. 
 Our goal is to invest capital to generate long-term value for our stockholders. This includes spending on capital projects; developing or acquiring strategic businesses; technologies and product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position; enhancing our existing set of product and service offerings, or entering into new markets; as well as periodically returning value to our stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. For example, we have completed the construction of our large valve manufacturing expansion in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and a facility in Kimball, Tennessee and are nearly complete with our new brass manufacturing facility in Decatur, Illinois. To a large degree, capital efficiency reflects how well we manage key risks. The actions taken to address specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency. If we do not allocate properly and manage our capital, we may fail to produce expected financial results, and we may experience a reduction in stockholder value, including increased volatility in our stock price. 
 We may not realize the expected benefits from our strategic reorganization plans. 
 Between November 2019 and September 2022, we transitioned all, or substantially all, operations from our facilities in Hammond, Indiana; Aurora, Illinois; Woodland, Washington; and Surrey, British Columbia, Canada; to our Kimball, Tennessee facility. Additionally, we are nearing completion of a new brass foundry in Decatur, Illinois to replace our original brass foundry. We cannot guarantee that the activities under the restructuring and reorganization activities will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings, if any.

 Index to Financial Statements 

Our business strategy includes developing, acquiring and investing in companies and technologies that broaden our product portfolio or complement our existing business, which could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources and adversely affect our operating results. 
 As part of our long-term business strategy, we continue to evaluate the development or acquisition of strategic businesses, technologies and product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position, enhance and expand our existing set of product and service offerings, or enter new markets. We may be unable to identify or successfully complete suitable acquisitions in the future and completed acquisitions may not be successful. 
 Acquisitions and technology investments may involve significant cash expenditures, the incurrence of debt, operating losses and expenses that could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These types of transactions involve numerous other risks, including but not limited to: 
 Diversion of management time and attention from existing operations, 
 Difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business or into our compliance and control programs, particularly those that include international operations, 
 Working with partners or other ownership structures with shared decision-making authority (our interests and other ownership interests may be inconsistent), 
 Difficulties in obtaining and verifying relevant information regarding a business or technology prior to the consummation of the transaction, including the identification and assessment of liabilities, claims or other circumstances, including those relating to intellectual property claims, that could result in litigation or regulatory exposure, 
 Assumptions of liabilities that exceed our estimated amounts, 
 Verification of financial statements and other business information of an acquired business, 
 Inability to obtain required regulatory approvals and/or required financing on favorable terms, 
 Potential loss of key employees, contractual relationships or customers of the acquired business, 
 Increased operating expenses related to the acquired businesses or technologies, 
 The failure of new technologies, products or services to gain market acceptance with acceptable profit margins, 
 Entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or in which competitors may have stronger market positions, 
 Dilution of stockholder value through the issuance of equity securities or equity-linked securities, and 
 Inability to achieve expected synergies or the achievement of such synergies taking longer than expected to realize, including increases in sales, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits ultimately may be smaller than we expected. 
 Any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition, as they may not be successful and may ultimately have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and/or result in impairment charges. 
 Potential international business opportunities may expose us to additional risks, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
 Part of our growth strategy depends on expanding internationally. Although sales outside of the United States account for a relatively small percentage of our total net sales, we have business activity in Canada, Israel and the United Kingdom. Some countries that present potential good business opportunities also face political and economic instability and vulnerability to infrastructure and other disruptions. Seeking to expand our business internationally exposes us to additional risks, which include foreign exchange risks and currency fluctuations, as discussed more fully below, political and economic uncertainties, changes in local business conditions and national and international conflicts. A primary risk we face in connection with our export shipments relates to our ability to collect amounts due from customers. We also face the potential risks arising from staffing, monitoring and managing international operations, including the risk that such activities may divert our resources and management time. 
 In addition, compliance with the laws, regulations and taxes of multiple international jurisdictions increases our cost of doing business. International operations are subject to anti-corruption laws and anti-competition regulations, among others. For example, the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws outside of the United States 
 14 

Table of Contents 
 Index to Financial Statements 

generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials and certain others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in criminal and civil sanctions, disrupt our business and adversely affect our brands, international expansion efforts, business and operating results. 
 We make sales, incur expenses and invest cash in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of United States dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the United States dollars we receive from sales denominated in a foreign currency. Changes between a foreign exchange rate and the United States dollar affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and could have a negative effect on our financial results. We expect that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow as the relative contribution of our operations outside the United States increases through both organic and inorganic growth. 
 
 Risks related to our operations 
 Our reliance on vendors for certain products, some of which are single-source or limited-source suppliers, could harm our business by adversely affecting product availability, reliability or cost. 
 We maintain several single-source or limited-source supplier relationships with manufacturers, including some outside of the United States. If the supply of a critical single- or limited-source product is delayed or curtailed, we may not be able to ship the related products in desired quantities or in a timely manner. Even where multiple sources of supply are available, qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of profits, which could harm our operating results. 
 These relationships reduce our direct control over production. Our reliance on these vendors subjects us to a greater risk of shortages, and reduced control over delivery schedules of products, as well as a greater risk of increased product costs. In instances where we stock lower levels of product inventories, a disruption in product availability could harm our financial performance and our ability to satisfy customer needs. In addition, defective products from these manufacturers could reduce product reliability and harm our reputation. 
 A disruption in our supply chain or other factors impacting the distribution of our products could adversely affect our business. 
 A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network at any of the freight companies that deliver components for our manufacturing operations in the United States or ship our fully-assembled products to our customers could adversely affect our business and result in lost sales and increased expenses or harm to our reputation. Our supply chain is dependent on third party ocean-going container ships, rail, barge, air and trucking systems and, therefore, disruption in these logistics services because of weather-related problems, strikes, bankruptcies, inflation, public health crises, such as pandemics, or other events could adversely affect our financial performance and financial condition, negatively impacting sales, profitability and cash flows. 
 The Israel-Hamas war caused a temporary shutdown in our facility in Ariel, Israel in October 2023. While we have partially reopened the facility, continued disruptions and escalations of conflicts in the area increase the likelihood of supply interruptions and may hinder our ability to acquire the necessary materials we need to make our products. Supply disruptions from lack of access to materials has impacted, and continues to impact, our ability to produce and deliver our products on time and at favorable pricing. 
 Seasonal demand for certain of our products and services may adversely affect our financial results. 
 Sales of some of our products, including iron gate valves and fire hydrants, are seasonal, with lower sales in our first and second fiscal quarters when weather conditions throughout the northern United States and most of Canada tend to be cold resulting in lower levels of construction activity. This seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in our sales and operating results. To satisfy demand during expected peak periods, we may incur costs associated with building inventory in off-peak periods, and our projections as to future needs may not be accurate. Because many of our expenses are fixed, seasonal trends can cause reductions in our profitability and profit margins and deterioration of our financial condition during periods affected by lower production or sales activity. 
 Transportation costs are relatively high for most of our products. 
 Transportation costs can be an important factor in a customer s purchasing decision. Many of our products are big, bulky and heavy, which tend to increase transportation costs. We also have relatively few manufacturing sites, which tends to increase transportation distances to our customers and consequently increases our transportation costs. High transportation costs could make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered by competitors.

Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of inflation. 
 
 Inflation has the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure, including purchased parts, commodity and raw material costs and labor. In an inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the prices of our products sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins and cash flows. Other inflationary pressures could affect wages, the cost and availability of components and raw materials and other inputs and our ability to meet customer demand. Inflation may further exacerbate other risk factors, including supply chain disruptions, risks related to international operations and the recruitment and retention of qualified employees . 
 
 Our high fixed costs may make it more difficult for us to respond to economic cycles. 
 A significant portion of our cost structure is fixed, including manufacturing overhead, capital equipment and research and development costs. In a prolonged economic downturn, these fixed costs may cause our gross margins to erode and our earnings to decline. 
 We may experience difficulties implementing upgrades to our software systems. 
 We engage in implementations and upgrades to our software systems, including to our Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system. The ERP is designed to accurately maintain the Company s books and records and provide information important to the operation of the business to the Company s management team. Any software implementation or upgrade requires significant investment of human and financial resources, and we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of our software systems, including our ERP, could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. While we invest significant resources in planning and project management, significant issues may arise. 
 
 Normal operations at our key manufacturing facilities may be interrupted. 
 Some of our key products, including fire hydrants, iron gate valves, service brass products, specialty valves and repair products are manufactured at a single facility or a few facilities, that depend on critical pieces of heavy equipment that cannot be moved economically to other locations or sourced quickly. We are therefore limited in our ability to shift production among locations. The operations at our manufacturing facilities may be interrupted or impaired by various operating risks, including, but not limited to: 
 Catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, explosions, natural disasters, public health crises, severe weather or other similar occurrences, 
 Terrorist attacks, wars, mass shootings or other acts of violence, 
 Interruptions in the delivery of raw materials or purchased parts, shortages of equipment or spare parts, or other manufacturing inputs, 
 Adverse government regulations, 
 Equipment or information systems breakdowns or failures, 
 Violations of our permit requirements or revocation of permits, 
 Release of pollutants and hazardous substances to air, soil, surface water or ground water, 
 Labor disputes, and 
 Cyberattacks and events. 
 The occurrence of any of these events may impair our production capabilities and adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flows. 
 Any inability to protect our intellectual property or our failure to effectively defend against intellectual property infringement claims could adversely affect our competitive position. 
 Our business depends on our technology and expertise, which were largely developed internally and are not subject to statutory protection. We rely on a combination of patent protection, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets protection, employee and third-party confidentiality agreements as well as technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. The methods we employ to protect our intellectual property rights may not adequately deter infringement, misappropriation or 
 16

independent development of our technology, and they may not prevent an unauthorized party from obtaining or using information or intellectual property that we regard as proprietary or keep others from using brand names similar to our own. The disclosure, misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property could harm our competitive position. In addition, our actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and other resources. We may also be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from time to time, which may result in additional expense and the diversion of resources to respond to these claims. Finally, for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection, once a patent has expired the product is further subjected to competition. Products under patent protection potentially generate significantly higher sales and earnings than those not protected by patents. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights or register new patents, our competitive position could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 If we do not successfully maintain our information and technology networks, including the security of those networks, our operations could be disrupted and unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in sales could result. 
 We rely on various information technology systems, some of which are controlled by outside service providers, to manage key aspects of our operations. The proper functioning of our information technology systems is important to the successful operation of our business. If critical information technology systems fail, or are otherwise unavailable, our ability to manufacture products, process orders, track credit risk, identify business opportunities, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, pay expenses and otherwise manage our business would be adversely affected. 
 We depend on the Internet and our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and among our personnel, suppliers and customers. Cyber and other data security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. For example, as a result of the cybersecurity incident announced on October 28, 2023, we experienced disruptions in our ability to manufacture products, perform normal financial-related activities (including accepting orders and invoicing third parties), and conduct daily administrative and operational functions. Likewise, if we or our service providers are unable to prevent future cybersecurity incidents, our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial, reputational or other harm. As a result of the cybersecurity incidents we experienced in October 2023, we have incurred costs, and we expect to continue to incur costs, which may be significant, in connection with efforts to investigate, assess the relevant impacts, recover our systems, enhance our data security, and protect against unauthorized access to, or manipulation of, our systems and data. Despite incurring these costs, we may not have identified and may not be able to remediate all of the potential causes of our cybersecurity incident, and similar incidents may occur in the future. Further, customers and third-party providers increasingly demand rigorous contractual provisions regarding privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, confidentiality, and intellectual property, which may also increase our overall compliance burden and related costs. 
 We may fail to effectively manage confidential data, which could harm our reputation, result in substantial additional costs and subject us to litigation. 
 As we grow our technology-enabled products, services and solutions, we continue to accumulate increasing volumes of customer data. In addition, we store personal information in connection with our human resources operations. Our efforts to protect this information may be unsuccessful as a result of employee errors or malfeasance, technical malfunctions, the actions of third parties such as a cyberattack or other factors. If our cyber defenses and other countermeasures are unable to protect personal data, it could be accessed or disclosed improperly, which could expose us to liability, harm our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services. The regulatory environment related to cyber and information security, data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. 
 Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced sales, increased costs, liability claims, unauthorized access to customer data, or harm to our reputation. 
 Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving and can take a variety of forms, increasing the difficulty of preventing, detecting and successfully defending against them. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our information technology systems. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, radio communication protocols, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services. Additionally, these actors may reverse engineer trade secrets or other confidential intellectual property, or gain access to our networks and data centers, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users or customers data, or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service attacks, deny or postpone access to critical water infrastructure telemetry through vulnerabilities in our cloud services and infrastructure,

or logging, sensing, and telemetry products. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. 
 For example, in October 2023, the cybersecurity event we suffered required us to temporarily suspend operations at certain of our facilities and we expect it to adversely impact our results for the first fiscal quarter of 2024, and such impact may be material. As a result of this incident, our relationship with our customers may be negatively impacted, and we may be subject to subsequent investigations, claims or actions, in addition to other costs, fines, penalties, or other obligations including additional administrative remediation costs. For additional information regarding this incident, please refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Despite the implementation of a variety of security controls and measures, as well as those of our third-party administrators and vendors, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent or detect another cybersecurity incident or other vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cybersecurity events, such as our October 2023 incident, have had and in the future may have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems. Such threats may also impact the networks and systems of our business associates and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business. As a result of our October 2023 incident, we have incurred costs, and we expect to continue to incur costs, which may be significant, in connection with efforts to investigate, assess the relevant impacts, recover our systems, enhance our data security, and protect against unauthorized access to, or manipulation of, our systems and data. Despite incurring these costs, we may not have identified and may not be able to remediate all of the potential causes of our cybersecurity incidents and similar incidents may occur in the future. Further, customers and third-party providers increasingly demand rigorous contractual provisions regarding privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, confidentiality and intellectual property, which may also increase our overall compliance burden and related costs. 
 Misuse of our technology-enabled products, services and solutions could lead to reduced sales, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation. 
 
 As we continue to design and develop products, services and solutions that leverage our hosted or cloud-based resources, the internet-of-things and other wireless/remote technologies and include networks of distributed and interconnected devices that contain sensors, data transfers and other computing capabilities, our customers data and systems may be subjected to harmful or illegal content or attacks, including potential cybersecurity threats. Additionally, we may not have adequately anticipated or precluded such cybersecurity threats through our product design or development. These products, services and solutions inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical security defects which may not have been remedied and cannot be disclosed without compromising security. We may also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix, and the timing of these fixes, which could result in compromised security. These vulnerabilities and security defects could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of information/data; adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our products, services and solutions; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. 
 
 We are subject to a variety of claims, investigations and litigation that could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our reputation. 
 In the normal course of business, we are subject to claims and lawsuits, including from time to time, claims for damages related to product liability and warranties, investigations by governmental agencies, litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights and litigation related to employee matters and commercial disputes. We may also be subject to investigations, claims, litigation and other proceedings outside the ordinary course of business, such as the June 2021 mass shooting event in our Albertville, Alabama facility. Defending these lawsuits and becoming involved in these investigations may divert management s attention, and may cause us to incur significant expenses, even if there is no evidence that our systems or practices were the cause of the claim. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards, penalties or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. See Item 1. BUSINESS - Regulatory and Environmental Matters, Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Contingencies and Note 15. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We are subject to stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may adversely affect us. 
 We are subject to stringent laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety and incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these requirements. Failure to comply with any environmental, health or safety requirements could result in the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, suspension of production, changes to equipment or processes or a cessation of operations at our facilities, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Because these laws are complex, subject to change and may be applied retroactively, we cannot predict with certainty the extent of our future liabilities with respect to environmental, health and safety matters and whether they will be material. 
 In addition, certain statutes such as CERCLA may impose joint and several liability for the costs of remedial investigations and actions on entities that generated waste, arranged for disposal of waste, transported to or selected the disposal sites and the past and present owners and operators of such sites. All such potentially responsible parties PRP ), or any one of them, including us, may be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault, the legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposal site. As a result, we may be required to conduct investigations and perform remedial activities at current and former operating and manufacturing sites where we have been deemed, or in the future could be named, a PRP with respect to such environmental liabilities, any of which could require us to incur material costs. The final remediation costs of these environmental sites may exceed estimated costs, and additional sites in the future may require material remediation expenses. If actual expenditures exceed our estimates, our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. See Item 1. BUSINESS - Regulatory and Environmental Matters, - Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Contingencies and Note 15. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Climate change and legal or regulatory responses thereto may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 There is growing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures as a result of increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Many of our manufacturing plants use significant amounts of electricity generated by burning fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide. Such climate change may impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Growing concern over climate change also may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. Increased energy or compliance costs and expenses as a result of increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the manufacturing and distribution of our products. The impacts of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. If we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our goals and commitments to reduce our carbon footprint or in environmental and sustainability programs and initiatives, the results could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 
 We rely on successors to Tyco to indemnify us for certain liabilities and they may become financially unable or fail to comply with the terms of the indemnity. 
 Under the terms of the acquisition agreement relating to the August 1999 sale by Tyco of businesses which make up certain of the companies within Mueller Water Products, Inc., we are indemnified by certain Tyco entities Tyco Indemnitors for all liabilities arising in connection with the operation of these businesses prior to their sale by Tyco, including with respect to products manufactured or sold prior to the closing of that transaction, as well as certain environmental liabilities. These indemnities survive indefinitely and are not subject to any dollar limits. In the past, Tyco Indemnitors have made substantial payments and assumed defense of claims in connection with these indemnification obligations. Tyco s indemnity does not cover liabilities to the extent caused by us or the operation of our businesses after August 1999, nor does it cover liabilities arising with respect to businesses or sites acquired after August 1999. Since 2007, Tyco has engaged in multiple corporate restructurings, split-offs and divestitures. The result of these transactions is that the assets of, and control over, Tyco Indemnitors has changed. Should any Tyco Indemnitor become financially unable or fail to comply with the terms of the indemnity, we may be responsible for such obligations or liabilities.

Risks related to our human capital 
 We depend on qualified personnel and if we are unable to retain or hire executive officers, key employees and skilled personnel, we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives and our business may be adversely affected. 
 From time to time, there may be changes to our executive leadership team, including as a result of the hiring, departure or realignment of key personnel. For example, in August 2023, we experienced changes to our executive leadership team as a result of the departure of our Chief Executive Officer. Any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves inherent risk, and any failure to find a necessary, suitable replacement on a timely basis to ensure a smooth transition could hinder our strategic planning, business execution and future performance. Our ability to expand or maintain our business depends on our ability to hire, train and retain employees, including executive officers, with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers. The increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult to attract and retain employees with requisite skill sets, particularly executive officers, as well as employees with specialized technical and trade experience. Changing demographics and labor work force trends also may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire. If we fail to attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel, or if we experience excessive turnover, we may experience declining sales, manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies, increased recruiting, training and relocation costs and other difficulties, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Competition for qualified personnel, particularly executive officers and skilled technical and trade workers, is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel, which could negatively impact our business. 
 If we are unable to negotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we experience strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest or higher than normal absenteeism, our business could suffer. 
 Many of our employees at our manufacturing locations are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on generally satisfactory terms, negotiations may be challenging as the Company must have a competitive cost structure in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our employees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could impact our financial position and results of operations. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our plants could impair our ability to supply products to our distributors and customers, which could reduce our sales, increase our expenses and expose us to customer claims. 
 
 Furthermore, our ability to meet product delivery commitments and labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including, but not limited to: 
 
 Market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, 
 Unemployment levels, 
 Health and other insurance costs, 
 The impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, immigration, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits, 
 Changing demographics, 
 Availability of skilled labor, and 
 Our reputation within the labor market. 
 
 We also compete with many other industries and businesses for most of our hourly production employees. An inability to provide wages and/or benefits that are competitive could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees. Further, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs. 
 
 Our expenditures for pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted. 
 We provide pension benefits to certain current and former employees. To determine our future payment obligations under the plans, certain rates of return on the plans assets, growth rates of certain costs and participant longevity have been estimated. The proportion of the assets held by our United States pension plan invested in fixed income securities, instead of equity securities, has decreased over historical levels. This shift in asset allocation has not resulted in a material change to our estimated rate of return on plan assets for this plan. Assumed discount rates, expected return on plan assets and participant longevity have significant effects on the amounts reported for our pension obligations and pension expense. 
 20 

Table of Contents 
 Index to Financial Statements 

The funded status of our pension plans may also be influenced by regulatory requirements, which can change unexpectedly and impose higher costs if funding levels are below certain thresholds. We may increase contributions to our pension plans to avoid or reduce these higher costs. 
 Significant adverse changes in credit and capital markets or changes in investments could result in discount rates or actual rates of return on plan assets being materially lower than projected and require us to increase pension contributions in future years to meet funding level requirements. Increasing life spans for plan participants may increase the estimated benefit payments and increase the amounts reported for pension obligations, pension contributions and pension expense. If increased funding requirements are particularly significant and sustained, our overall liquidity could be materially reduced, which could cause us to reduce investments and capital expenditures, or restructure or refinance our debt, among other things. 
 The Israel-Hamas war may adversely affect our ability to staff and operate our Ariel, Israel facility. 
 We have historically employed Palestinians in our Ariel, Israel facility. As a result of the Israel-Hamas war, upon reopening the facility after a temporary shutdown, Palestinian employees have not been permitted to return to the area due to travel and movement restrictions imposed on Palestinian workers in connection with the war. This has resulted in some delays in our ability to produce and deliver products. If this situation continues and we are unable to successfully add supplemental staff resources with sufficient technical skills to replace such workers, we may experience increased delays in our ability to produce and deliver certain of our products to customers, and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. 
 
 Risks related to our international operations 
 Any failure to satisfy international trade laws and regulations or to otherwise comply with changes or other trade developments may adversely affect us. 
 Our operations require importing and exporting goods and technology among countries on a regular basis. Thus, the sale and shipment of our products and services across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subject us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Trade laws and regulations are complex, differ by country, and are enforced by a variety of government agencies. Because we are subject to extensive trade laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, we are subject to the risk that laws and regulations could change in a manner that would expose us to additional costs, penalties or liabilities, and our policies and procedures may not always protect us from actions that would violate international trade laws and regulations. For example, certain federal legislation requires the use of American iron and steel products in certain water projects receiving certain federal appropriations. We have incurred costs in connection with ensuring our ability to certify to these requirements, including those associated with enhancing our assembly operations and sourcing practices. As a result of the varying legal and regulatory requirements to which our cross-border activities are subject, we may not always be in compliance with the trade laws and regulations in all respects. Any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including material monetary fines, or other adverse actions, including denial of import or export privileges, and could harm our reputation and our business prospects. 
 If significant tariffs or other restrictions continue to be placed on foreign imports by the United States and related countermeasures are taken by impacted foreign countries, our sales and results of operations may be harmed. 
 If significant tariffs or other restrictions continue to be placed on foreign imports by the United States and related countermeasures are taken by impacted foreign countries, our sales and results of operations may be harmed. For example, trade tensions between the United States and China have led to a series of significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories over recent years. The materials subject to these tariffs could impact our raw material costs as well. However, if further tariffs are imposed on a broader range of imports, or if further retaliatory trade measures are taken by China or other countries in response to additional tariffs, we may be required to raise our prices or incur additional expenses, which may result in the loss of customers and harm our operating performance, sales and earnings. 
 The prices of our purchased components and raw materials can be volatile. 
 Our operations require substantial amounts of purchased components and raw materials, such as scrap steel, sand, resin, brass ingot and steel pipe. The cost and availability of these materials are subject to economic forces largely beyond our control, including North American and international demand, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, freight costs, tariffs, commodity speculation and other external factors, including public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other supply chain challenges. Inflation in material costs has occurred in 2022 and 2023 and we expect it to continue into fiscal 2024. 
 
 We may not be able to pass on all, or any, of increased costs for purchased components and raw materials to our customers or offset fully the effects of these higher costs through productivity improvements. In particular, when purchased component or raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than normal levels, we may not be able to pass cost increases 
 21 

Table of Contents 
 Index to Financial Statements 

through to our customers on a timely basis, if at all, which would reduce our profitability and cash flows. In addition, if purchased components or raw materials are not available or not available on commercially reasonable terms, our sales, profitability and cash flows would be reduced. Our competitors may secure more reliable sources of purchased components and raw materials or they may obtain these supplies on more favorable terms than we do, which could give them a cost advantage. 
 Our business, operating results and financial condition may be negatively impacted by geopolitical events, including wars, terrorism, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. 
 
 Political events, international disputes, wars, terrorism, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce as well as the global economy and could have a materially adverse effect on us and our customers, suppliers, logistics providers, distributors and other channel partners. The threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response thereto, or any other current or future acts of terrorism, wars, including the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine wars, and other events, including economic sanctions and trade restrictions, have disrupted the world s economies and may cause further disruptions that could negatively impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 
 Our Krausz business includes a manufacturing facility in Ariel, Israel. Supply chain disruptions and our inability to appropriately staff the Ariel facility has limited, and may continue to limit, our ability to produce Krausz products. These impacts are requiring us to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, outsourcing portions of the manufacturing process and modifying the manner in which we staff our facilities. Changing our operations in response to wartime impacts can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. If the Israel-Hamas war further escalates, additional restrictions and other governmental actions could increase the severity of the impact on our operations in Israel and could materially adversely affect our business. A severe disruption to our business may result in significant lost sales and may require substantial recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. 
 
 Additionally, to the extent the Israel-Hamas war causes loss of infrastructure and utilities services, such as energy, transportation, or telecommunications, plant closures and employee concerns in our Krausz business, we could experience increased costs and other negative financial impacts. If such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
 Other risks related to our business 
 Our business, operations and markets, and those of our suppliers, business partners and customers, may be adversely affected by current and future outbreaks of infectious diseases or other health crises. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on global economies have created a number of macroeconomic challenges that have impacted our business, including volatility and uncertainty in business planning, disruptions in global supply chains, material, freight and labor inflation, shortages of and delays in obtaining certain materials and component parts, and labor shortages. 
 Future outbreaks of infectious diseases, including further developments in the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in widespread or localized health crises that adversely affect general commercial activity and the economies and markets of the countries and localities in which we operate, sell, and purchase goods and services. Any outbreak of infectious disease poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, transportation providers, and other business partners may be prevented or impaired from conducting ordinary business activities for an indefinite period of time, including self-imposed facility shutdowns to protect the health and well-being of our employees or government-mandated shutdowns. In addition, our suppliers, business partners and customers may also experience similar negative impacts. Global supply chains may be disrupted, causing shortages, which could impact our ability to manufacture or supply our products. This disruption of our employees, distributors, suppliers and customers may impact our sales and future operating results.

Overview 
 Business 
 We adopted our current management structure effective October 1, 2021 which resulted in a change to our reportable segments. Under this structure, we operate our business through two segments, Water Flow Solutions and Water Management Solutions. 
 Effective August 21, 2023, the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO left his role and Marietta Edmunds Zakas, the Company s Chief Financial Officer CFO was named President and CEO. Steven S. Heinrichs, the Company s Chief Legal and Compliance Officer was named CFO and continues to serve as Chief Legal and Compliance Officer. In addition, certain other management changes occurred. As a result, the Company incurred transition and retention expense which has been recorded to Strategic reorganization and other charges in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 We estimate approximately 60 to 65 of the Company s 2023 net sales were associated with repair and replacement of municipal water infrastructure, approximately 25 to 30 were related to residential construction activity and approximately 10 were related to natural gas utilities and industrial applications. 
 After experiencing challenges in 2020 and 2021 resulting from the pandemic, municipal spending on repair and replacement projects in 2023 and 2022 returned to more normalized levels. According to the United States Department of Labor, the trailing twelve-month average consumer price index for water and sewerage rates at September 30, 2023 increased 4.6 . 
 Recent Developments 
 In October 2023, the Israel-Hamas war caused a temporary shutdown in our facility in Ariel, Israel. While we have reopened the facility, the war increases the likelihood of supply interruptions and may hinder our ability to acquire the necessary materials we need to make our products. Supply disruptions from lack of access to materials has impacted, and continues to impact, our ability to produce and deliver our products on time and at favorable pricing from our facility in Ariel, Israel. 
 As announced on October 28, 2023, we identified a cybersecurity incident impacting certain internal operations and information technology systems. Based on the information reviewed to date, we believe the unauthorized activity has been contained. All of our facilities are operational and have substantially returned to normalized operations. 
 The cybersecurity incident consisted of unauthorized access and deployment of ransomware by a third party to a portion of our internal information infrastructure. The incident caused temporary disruptions and limitations of access to portions of our business applications supporting aspects of our operations and corporate functions, which limited our ability to take orders and ship products. Shipping delays and investigation and remediation costs in connection with the incident are expected to adversely impact our results for the first quarter of 2024, and such impact may be material. We have largely restored the impacted applications and systems, and we continue to execute business continuity and restoration plans for the remaining impacted applications and systems. As reported on November 29, 2023, we identified a separate cybersecurity incident, which primarily related to a system that was at the end of its useful life and was already in the process of being replaced in the ordinary course of business. 
 Our investigation and remediation efforts remain ongoing, including an analysis of data accessed, exfiltrated or otherwise impacted in connection with the cybersecurity incidents. We continue to evaluate the business, financial and related impacts of the cybersecurity incidents.

Outlook 
 We expect the operating environment during fiscal 2024 to continue to be challenging as a result of high interest rates, the inflationary environment, labor challenges and a potential recession. We anticipate lower demand in the municipal repair and replacement end market due to budgetary pressures on municipalities resulting from high interest rates and inflation, especially for smaller municipalities. Demand from the new residential construction end market decreased in fiscal 2023 reflecting a 12.9 decrease in total housing starts as compared with fiscal 2022 according to Census data. For fiscal 2024, we anticipate that high interest rates will continue to impact housing starts and new lot and land development . In November 2023, Blue Chip Economic Indicators forecasted a 2.2 decrease in total housing starts for the calendar year 2024 compared to the calendar year 2023. 
 For our fiscal year 2024, we anticipate that consolidated net sales will be 3 to 8 lower than our fiscal year 2023 sales primarily driven by a decrease in volumes. In 2023, material costs rose as a result of an increase in purchased parts costs, primarily driven by higher freight, labor and energy costs. In 2024, we anticipate that inflation will continue in some areas leading to a modest increase in manufacturing costs. Additionally, as a result of the cybersecurity incident that occurred subsequent to the end of fiscal 2023, our 2024 operating results will be impacted by the expenses we have incurred and will continue to incur to investigate, assess, and remedy this incident. We currently are unable to estimate the impact that this will have on our financial results.

 Consolidated Analysis 
 Net sales for 2023 increased 28.3 million, or 2.3 , to 1,275.7 million from 1,247.4 million in the prior year primarily as a result of higher pricing across most of our product lines partially offset by lower volumes at Water Flow Solutions. 
 Gross profit increased 15.2 million, or 4.2 , to 379.5 million for 2023 compared with 364.3 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of higher pricing which was partially offset by lower volumes, unfavorable manufacturing performance, including labor and material inefficiencies and increased outsourcing, as well as inflation. Gross margin increased to 29.7 in 2023 as compared with 29.2 in the prior year.

Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A increased 1.3 to 241.9 million for 2023 from 238.7 million in the prior year. The increase in SG A was primarily a result of higher costs associated with inflation, third-party fees, and insurance, partially offset by lower personnel-related and incentive costs. As a percentage of net sales, SG A decreased 10 basis points to 19.0 of net sales from 19.1 in the prior year. 
 Strategic reorganization and other charges for 2023 of 10.2 million primarily consisted of expenses associated with the leadership transition and other restructuring charges related to severance in addition to certain transaction-related expenses. Strategic reorganization and other charges for 2022 of 7.2 million primarily consisted of certain transaction-related costs, expenses associated with our restructuring activities, and the Albertville tragedy. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2022, we incurred a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 6.8 million within the Water Flow Solutions segment. No impairment charge was recorded in 2023. 
 
 Interest expense, net declined 2.2 million in 2023 from the prior year primarily as a result of higher interest income associated with higher interest rates. The components of net interest expense are provided below. 
 
 Year ended September 30, 
 2023 2022 (in millions) 4.0 Senior Notes 18.0 18.0 Deferred financing costs amortization 1.0 1.0 ABL Agreement 0.9 0.9 Capitalized interest (1.6) (2.6) Other interest expense 0.1 0.3 Total interest expense 18.4 17.6 Interest income (3.7) (0.7) Total interest expense, net 14.7 16.9 
 
 Income tax expense of 23.5 million in 2023 resulted in an effective income tax rate of 21.6 , which was lower than the 22.3 rate in the prior year reflecting benefits from research and development tax credits and lower effective state tax rates due to state apportionment changes. 
 Segment Analysis 
 Water Flow Solutions 
 Net sales for 2023 decreased 79.7 million, or 11.2 , to 634.4 million from 714.1 million in the prior year. Net sales decreased primarily as a result of lower volumes in iron gate valves and service brass products partially offset by higher pricing across most of Water Flow Solutions product lines. 
 Gross profit for 2023 decreased 47.5 million, or 22.4 , to 164.9 million from 212.4 million in the prior year primarily as a result of lower volumes, as well as unfavorable manufacturing performance and inflation partially offset by higher pricing across most product lines. Gross margin was 26.0 in 2023, as compared with 29.7 in the prior year. 
 SG A in 2023 decreased 2.1 to 85.3 million from 87.1 million in the prior year primarily as a result of lower personnel and incentive related costs partially offset by higher costs associated with inflation, increased third-party fees, and higher insurance expense. SG A as a percentage of net sales was 13.4 and 12.2 for 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 During the year ended September 30, 2022, Water Flow Solutions incurred a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 6.8 million. No impairment charge was recorded in 2023.

Water Management Solutions 
 Net sales in 2023 increased 108.0 million, or 20.3 , to 641.3 million from 533.3 million in the prior year primarily as a result of higher pricing across most of Water Management Solutions product lines and increased volumes, particularly of fire hydrants due to an elevated backlog, as well as across most product lines. 
 Gross profit in 2023 increased 62.7 million or 41.3 , to 214.6 million from 151.9 million in the prior year. Gross margin increased to 33.5 in 2023 from 28.5 in the prior year primarily as a result of higher pricing and increased volumes across most product lines partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing performance and inflation. 
 SG A increased 4.0 to 106.9 million in 2023 from 102.8 million in the prior year primarily as a result of higher costs associated with inflation, third-party fees, and new product development, partially offset by lower personnel-related and incentive costs. SG A as a percentage of net sales was 16.7 for 2023 and 19.3 in the prior year. 
 Corporate 
 SG A increased 0.9 million from 48.8 million in 2022 to 49.7 million in 2023 as a result of higher costs associated with inflation offset by lower personnel and incentive related costs. 

Financial Condition 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 160.3 million at September 30, 2023 and 146.5 million at September 30, 2022. Cash and cash equivalents increased during 2023 as a result of 109.0 million in cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by capital expenditures of 47.6 million, dividend payments of 38.1 million, 10.0 million in common stock repurchases, and 4.3 million in effect of currency exchange rate changes on cash. 
 Receivables, net were 217.1 million at September 30, 2023 and 228.0 million at September 30, 2022. This decrease was primarily a result of lower sales in the final quarter of the year compared with the prior year. 
 Inventories, net were 297.9 million at September 30, 2023 and 278.7 million at September 30, 2022. Inventories increased during 2023 as a result of inflation and select inventory management to meet anticipated orders. 
 Property, plant and equipment, net was 311.7 million at September 30, 2023 and 301.6 million at September 30, 2022. Property, plant and equipment increased as a result of 47.6 million in capital expenditures primarily associated with our new foundry in Decatur, Illinois. Depreciation expense was 34.4 million in 2023 compared with 32.0 million in 2022 as a result of generally higher level of capital expenditures over the last two years. 
 Intangible assets were 334.0 million at September 30, 2023 and 361.2 million at September 30, 2022. Finite-lived intangible assets, net totaling 61.4 million at September 30, 2023, are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense was 28.1 million in 2023 and 28.5 million in 2022. We expect amortization expense for these assets to be approximately 27 million for 2024, decreasing to approximately 7 million in fiscal 2025, approximately 6 million in fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027, and approximately 5 million in fiscal 2028. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, 272.6 million at September 30, 2023, are not amortized but are tested for potential impairment at least annually. 
 Accounts payable and other current liabilities were 218.1 million at September 30, 2023 and 240.2 million at September 30, 2022. Accounts payable decreased during 2023 as a result of timing and a comparative reduction in the volume of inventory purchases. Other current liabilities decreased during 2023 primarily as a result of lower personnel-related expenses, including incentive compensation. 
 Total outstanding debt was 447.4 million as of September 30, 2023 and 446.9 million as of September 30, 2022. Total debt increased due to the amortization of deferred financing costs. 
 Deferred income taxes were net liabilities of 73.8 million at September 30, 2023 and 86.3 million at September 30, 2022, primarily related to intangible assets. The 12.5 million decrease in the net liability was primarily a result of an increase in deferred tax assets related to Internal Revenue Code Section 174 pertaining to the amortization of research and development expenditures which was first applicable to us beginning in our fiscal year 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of 160.3 million at September 30, 2023 and approximately 162.4 million of additional borrowing capacity under our asset-based lending arrangement (the ABL based on September 30, 2023 data. Undistributed earnings from our subsidiaries in Israel, Canada and China are considered to be permanently invested outside of the United States. At September 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents included 66.7 million, 8.7 million, and 10.9 million in Israel, Canada, and China, respectively. 
 We declared a quarterly dividend of 0.064 per common share on October 24, 2023, payable on or about November 20, 2023 to holders of record as of November 9, 2023, resulting in an estimated 10.0 million cash outlay. 
 We repurchased 10.0 million of our outstanding common stock during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and had 90.0 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of September 30, 2023. 
 The ABL and 4.0 Senior Notes contain customary representations and warranties, covenants and provisions governing an event of default. The covenants restrict our ability to engage in certain activities including, but not limited to, the payment of dividends and the redemption of our common stock. 
 Collections from customers were higher during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 as compared with the prior year period primarily as a result of higher sales during the comparative periods. Inventories increased during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 as a result of timing and an increased volume of inventory purchases, partially offset by a decrease in inventory backlog. Other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities decreased as a result of employee incentive payouts, operating lease liabilities, and the repayment of the CARES Act employer payroll tax deferral, partially offset by an increase in the warranty accrual and returned goods refund liability. 
 Capital expenditures were 47.6 million for 2023 compared with 54.7 million for 2022. Capital expenditures decreased compared with the prior year period primarily as a result of lower expenditures associated with the new Decatur, Illinois foundry. We estimate 2024 capital expenditures will be between 45.0 million and 50.0 million. 
 Income tax payments were higher during 2023 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of higher income before income taxes as well as the timing of certain federal and state extension payments. We expect the effective tax rate in 2024 to be between 23 and 25 . 
 Our stock repurchase program allows us to repurchase up to 250.0 million of our common stock, of which we had remaining authorization of 90.0 million as of September 30, 2023. The program does not commit us to any particular timing or quantity of purchases, and we may suspend or discontinue the program at any time. We repurchased 714,830 and 2,654,254 shares of our common stock in 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 We use letters of credit a nd surety bonds in the ordinary course of business to ensure the performance of contractual obligations. As of September 30, 2023, we had 12.4 million of letters of credit and 22.2 million of surety bonds outstanding. 
 We anticipate our existing cash, cash equivalents and borrowing capacity combined with our expected operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating needs, income tax payments, capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due through the twelve months from the date of this filing. However, our ability to make these payments will depend largely on our future operating performance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. 
 ABL Agreement 
 Our ABL, as amended, is provided by a consortium of banking institutions and consists of a revolving credit facility of 175.0 million in borrowing capacity that expires in July 29, 2025. Included in the ABL is the ability to borrow up to 25.0 million of swing line loans and up to 60.0 million of letters of credit. The ABL permits us to increase the size of the credit facility by an additional 150.0 million in certain circumstances subject to adequate borrowing base availability. 
 On April 5, 2023, we amended the ABL to replace LIBOR-based loans with Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR based loans plus an adjustment of 10 basis points, among other immaterial modifications. 
 Borrowings under the ABL bear interest at a floating rate equal to SOFR plus an adjustment of 10 basis points and an applicable margin range of 200 to 225 basis points, or a base rate, as defined in the ABL, plus an applicable margin of 100 to 125 basis points. At September 30, 2023, the applicable margin was 200 basis points for SOFR-based loans and 100 basis points for base rate loans.

 Index to Financial Statements 

The ABL is subject to mandatory prepayments if total outstanding borrowings under the ABL are greater than the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility or if we dispose of overdue accounts receivable in certain circumstances. The borrowing base under the ABL is equal to the sum of (a) 85 of the value of eligible accounts receivable and (b) the lesser of (i) 70 of the value of eligible inventory or (ii) 85 of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory, less certain reserves. Prepayments can be made at any time without penalty. 
 Substantially all of our United States subsidiaries are borrowers under the ABL and are jointly and severally liable for any outstanding borrowings. Our obligations under the ABL are secured by a first-priority perfected lien on all of our United States inventory, accounts receivable, certain cash balances and other supporting obligations. 
 The ABL includes a commitment fee for any unused borrowing capacity of 37.5 basis points per annum. Borrowings are not subject to any financial maintenance covenants unless excess availability is less than the greater of 17.5 million and 10 of the Loan Cap as defined in the ABL. Excess availability based on September 30, 2023 data was 162.4 million, as reduced by 12.4 million of outstanding letters of credit and 0.2 million of accrued fees and expenses. 
 In December 2023, we obtained a waiver under our ABL to provide us additional time to deliver to the ABL lenders certain information that was delayed as a result of the cybersecurity incident. The maximum aggregate of borrowings and other credit extensions under the ABL is limited to 50.0 million at any time outstanding until all of the delayed deliveries required under the ABL have been made. 
 4.0 Senior Unsecured Notes 
 On May 28, 2021, we privately issued 450.0 million of 4.0 Senior Unsecured Notes 4.0 Senior Notes ), which mature on June 15, 2029 and bear interest at 4.0 , paid semi-annually in June and December. We capitalized 5.5 million of financing costs, which are being amortized over the term of the 4.0 Senior Notes using the effective interest method. Proceeds from the 4.0 Senior Notes, along with cash on hand were used to redeem previously existing 5.5 Senior Notes. Substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the 4.0 Senior Notes, which are subordinate to borrowings under our ABL. Based on quoted market prices the outstanding 4.0 Senior Notes had a fair value of 393.7 million at September 30, 2023. 
 An indenture securing the 4.0 Senior Notes Indenture contains customary covenants and events of default, including covenants that limit our ability to incur certain debt and liens. We believe we were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2023. There are no financial maintenance covenants associated with the Indenture. 
 We may redeem some or all of the 4.0 Senior Notes at any time prior to June 15, 2024, at certain make-whole redemption prices and on or after June 15, 2024 at specified redemption prices. Additionally, we may redeem up to 40 of the aggregate principal amount of the 4.0 Senior Notes at any time prior to June 15, 2024, with the net proceeds of specified equity offerings at specified redemption prices as set forth in the Indenture. Upon a change of control, as defined, we would be required to offer to purchase the 4.0 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101 of the outstanding principal amount of the 4.0 Senior Notes. 
 5.5 Senior Unsecured Notes 
 On June 12, 2018, we privately issued 450.0 million of 5.5 Senior Unsecured Notes 5.5 Senior Notes ), which were set to mature in 2026 and bore interest at 5.5 , paid semi-annually. We called the 5.5 Senior Notes effective June 17, 2021 and settled with proceeds from the issuance of the 4.0 Senior Notes and cash on hand. As a result, we incurred 16.7 million in loss on early extinguishment of debt, comprised of a 12.4 million call premium and a 4.3 million write-off of the remaining deferred debt issuance costs associated with the retirement of the 5.5 Senior Notes.

Effect of Inflation 
 We experience changing price levels primarily related to purchased components and raw materials. During our fiscal year 2023, we experienced an 8 decrease in the average cost per ton of scrap steel and a 2 decrease in the average cost of brass as compared with our fiscal year 2022. We anticipate inflation in raw and other material costs in 2024, including on purchased components, which is likely to have an adverse effect on our margins to the extent we are unable to pass on such higher costs to our customers. 
 During fiscal year 2023, we experienced labor inflation of approximately 4.5 , consistent with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

Material Cash Requirements 
 
 We enter into a variety of contractual obligations as part of our normal operations in addition to capital expenditures. As of September 30, 2023, we have (i) debt obligations related to our 450.0 million 4.0 Senior Notes which mature in 2029 and include cash interest payments of 18.0 million in 2024 annually through 2029; (ii) cumulative cash obligations of 29.0 million for operating leases through 2033 and 1.4 million for finance leases through 2028; and (iii) purchase obligations for raw materials and other purchased parts of approximately 106.1 million and 1.4 million which we expect to incur during 2024 and 2025, respectively. Additionally, we will incur costs in 2024 to address and remediate the October 2023 cybersecurity incident, the extent of which is uncertain at this time. We expect to fund these cash requirements from cash on hand and cash generated from operations. 

Seasonality 
 Our business is seasonal as a result of the impact of cold weather conditions. Net sales and operating income historically have been lowest in the three month periods ending December 31 and March 31 when the northern United States and most of Canada generally face weather conditions that restrict significant construction activity. For example, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, net sales for the first half of the fiscal year averaged approximately 45 of consolidated net sales for the five-year period from 2015 to 2019. See Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Seasonal demand for certain of our products and services may adversely affect our financial results. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are based upon experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur over time or the use of reasonably different estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our critical accounting estimates include the below items. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 For the majority of sales, we recognize revenue when control of promised products is transferred to our customers, in amounts that reflect the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, the payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. We determine the appropriate revenue recognition for our contracts with customers by analyzing the type, terms and conditions of each contract or arrangement with a customer. See Note 3. for more information regarding our revenues. 
 Inventories, net 
 We record inventories at the lower of first-in, first-out method cost or estimated net realizable value. Inventory cost includes an overhead component that can be affected by levels of production and actual costs incurred. We evaluate the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. This evaluation includes such factors as anticipated usage, inventory levels and ultimate product sales value. If in our judgment persuasive evidence exists that the net realizable value of 
 34

inventory is lower than its cost, the inventory value is written-down to its estimated net realizable value. Significant judgments regarding future events and market conditions must be made when estimating net realizable value. 
 Income Taxes 
 We recognize deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets when, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our deferred tax liabilities and assets are based on our expectations of future operating performance, reversal of taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, interpretation of the tax regulations currently enacted and rulings in numerous tax jurisdictions. 
 We only record tax benefits for positions that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under audit examination based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. The amount of tax benefit recognized for any position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold is the largest amount of the tax benefit that we believe is greater than 50 likely of being realized. 
 Accounting for the Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets 
 We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. We perform this annual impairment testing on September 1, using standard valuation methodologies and rates that we considered reasonable and appropriate. 
 We evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative analysis. The carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, is compared with the estimated fair value of the reporting unit utilizing a combination of the income and market approaches. The income approach, which is a level 3 fair value measurement, is based on projected debt-free cash flow which is discounted to the present value using discount rates that consider the timing and risk of the cash flows. The market approach is based on the guideline public company method, which uses market multiples to value our reporting units. We weight the income and market approaches in a manner considering the risks of the underlying cash flows. 
 
 This income approach is dependent on management s best estimates of future operating results, including forecasted sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA margins and the selection of discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to management's application of these assumptions. 
 
 We test our trade name indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment using a royalty savings method, which is a variation of the discounted cash flow method. This method estimates a fair value by calculating an estimated discounted future cash flow stream from the hypothetical licensing of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. If this estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. This analysis is dependent on management s best estimates of future operating results and the selection of reasonable discount rates and hypothetical royalty rates. 
 
 We performed our annual impairment testing at September 1, 2023. The results of the testing indicated that the fair value exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units which contain goodwill. As such, no impairment charge was recorded. O ur determination of the estimated fair value was based on a combination of the discounted cash flow method and the guideline public company method. Additionally, w e performed our annual impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets at September 1, 2023 and concluded impairment losses should be recognized.

Warranty Cost 
 We accrue for warranty expenses that can include customer costs of repair and/or replacement, including labor, materials, equipment, freight and reasonable overhead costs. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time of sale if such costs are determined to be reasonably estimable at that time. Warranty cost estimates are revised throughout applicable warranty periods as better information regarding warranty costs becomes available. Critical factors in our analyses include warranty terms, specific claim situations, general incurred and projected failure rates, the nature of product failures, product and labor costs, and general business conditions. These estimates are inherently uncertain as they are based on historical data. If warranty claims are made in the current period for issues that have not historically been the subject of warranty claims and were not taken into consideration in establishing the accrual or if claims for issues already considered in establishing the accrual exceed expectations, warranty expense may exceed the accrual for that particular product. Additionally, a significant increase in costs to repair or replace could require additional warranty expense. We monitor and analyze our warranty experience and costs periodically and revise our warranty accrual as necessary. However, as we cannot predict actual future claims, the potential exists for the difference in any one reporting period to be material. 
 Contingencies 
 We are involved in litigation, investigations and claims arising in the normal course of business. We estimate and accrue liabilities resulting from such matters based on a variety of factors, including outstanding legal claims and proposed settlements; assessments by counsel of pending or threatened litigation; and assessments of potential environmental liabilities and remediation costs. We believe we have adequately accrued for these potential liabilities; however, facts and circumstances may change and could cause the actual liability to exceed estimates, or may require adjustments to the recorded liability balances in the future. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change as a result of such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For more information on these and other contingencies, see Note 15. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Item 1. BUSINESS - Regulatory and Environmental Matters, Item 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 Workers Compensation, Defined Benefit Pension Plans, Environmental and Other Long-term Liabilities 
 We are obligated for various liabilities that ultimately will be determined over what could be very long future time periods. We established the recorded liabilities for such items at September 30, 2023 using estimates for when such amounts will be paid and what the amounts of such payments will be. These estimates are subject to change based on numerous factors including, among others, claim development, regulatory changes, technology changes, the investment performance of related assets, longevity of participants, the discount rate used and changes to plan designs. 

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to various market risks, including potential losses arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, such as various commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Our primary financial instruments are cash and cash equivalents. This includes cash in banks and highly rated, liquid money market investments. We believe these instruments are not subject to material potential near-term losses in future earnings from reasonably possible near-term changes in market rates or prices. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Our products are made using various purchased components and several basic raw materials, including brass ingot, scrap steel, sand and resin. We expect prices for these items to fluctuate based on marketplace demand. Our product margins and level of profitability may fluctuate whether or not we sufficiently pass increases in purchased component and raw material costs on to our customers. 
 We experienced an 8 decrease in the average cost per ton of scrap steel and a 2 decrease in the average cost of brass ingot in 2023 compared to 2022. See Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-The prices of our purchased components and raw materials can be volatile.

Currency Risk 
 Our principal assets, liabilities and operations outside the United States are in Israel, Canada and China. Foreign reporting entities are remeasured into local currencies with the effect reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars at currency exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, with the effect of such translation reflected in other comprehensive income (loss). Our stockholders equity will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the United States dollar against these non-United States currencies. Net sales and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars at the average relevant foreign currency exchange rate during the period.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, those officers have concluded that, at September 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 framework). After doing so, management concluded that, at September 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at September 30, 2023 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in this Annual Report.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Mueller Water Products, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mueller Water Products, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income , equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated December 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit s . We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

Valuation of Goodwill Description of the Matter At September 30, 2023, the Company s goodwill was million. As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company performed its annual impairment tests of goodwill and determined the fair values of its reporting units using the discounted cash flow method, a form of the income approach, and the guideline public company method, a form of the market approach. 
 
 Auditing management s estimates of reporting unit fair values using the discounted cash flow method involved especially subjective judgments due to the significant estimation uncertainty in determining the fair values of the reporting units. In particular, the fair value estimates were sensitive to significant assumptions such as forecasted revenues, EBITDA margins and discount rates. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future industry, market and economic conditions. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company s controls over review of the fair values of the reporting units. This included testing controls over management s review of the significant assumptions described above. 
 
 To test the estimated fair values of the reporting units, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies used to estimate fair values, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the fair value estimates, and testing the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis for completeness and accuracy. For example, we evaluated management s forecasted revenues and EBITDA margins used in the fair value estimates by comparing those assumptions to historical results and available market information. We also involved our valuation specialists to evaluate the valuation methodologies and the discount rates. As part of this evaluation, we compared the discount rates to market data. In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the significant assumptions to evaluate the potential change in the fair values of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions.

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2007.

 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note 1. 
 business segments: Water Flow Solutions and Water Management Solutions. These segments are based on a management reorganization that became effective October 1, 2021; prior period information was recast to conform to the current presentation. Water Flow Solutions portfolio includes iron gate valves, specialty valves and service brass products. Water Management Solutions portfolio includes fire hydrants, repair and installation, natural gas, metering, leak detection, and pressure management and control products and solutions. The Company, we, us or our refers to Mueller Water Products, Inc. and its subsidiaries. With regard to the Company s segments, we, us or our may also refer to the segment being discussed. 
 We have approximately employees globally, of which approximately of our United States hourly workers are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
 On December 3, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Krausz Industries Development Ltd. and subsidiaries Krausz ). During our 2020 and 2019 fiscal years, we included the financial statements of Krausz on a one-month lag. During the year ended September 30, 2021, we aligned the consolidation of the financial statements of Krausz in the Company s consolidated financial statements, eliminating the previous inclusion of Krausz financial statements with a one-month reporting lag. In accordance with applicable accounting literature, the elimination of the one-month reporting lag is considered to be a change in accounting principle. We believe this change in accounting principle is preferable as the financial statements of all of our subsidiaries are now reported on the same basis, providing the most current information available. The effect of the elimination of the reporting lag during the year ended September 30, 2021 resulted in an increase of 6.0 million to net sales. We concluded that the effect of this change was not material to the financial statements. 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), which require us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current presentation. These reclassifications primarily relate to a change in our reportable segments as described in Note 14. 
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, whenever we refer to a particular year, we mean our fiscal year ended or ending September 30 in that particular calendar year. 
 New Markets Tax Credit Program On December 22, 2020, we entered into a financing transaction with Wells Fargo Community Investment Holdings, LLC Wells Fargo related to our brass foundry construction project in Decatur, Illinois under a qualified New Markets Tax Credit program NMTC ). The NMTC is a federal program intended to encourage capital investment in qualified lower income communities. Under the NMTC, investors claim federal income tax credits over a period of seven years in connection with qualified investments in the equity of community development entities CDE s), which are privately managed investment institutions that are certified to make qualified low-income community investments, such as in our foundry project. 
 Under the NMTC, Wells Fargo contributed capital of million to an investment fund and we loaned million to the fund. Wells Fargo is entitled to the associated tax credits, which are subject to 100 recapture if we do not comply with various regulations and contractual provisions surrounding the foundry project. We have indemnified Wells Fargo for any loss or recapture of tax credits related to the transaction until the seven-year period elapses. We do not anticipate any credit recaptures will be required in connection with this arrangement. 
 
 The investment fund contributed million cash for a 99.99 stake in a joint venture Sub-CDE with a CDE. The Sub-CDE then loaned million to us, with the use of the loan proceeds restricted to foundry project expenditures. This transaction also includes a put/call provision under which we may be obligated or entitled to repurchase Wells Fargo s interest in the investment fund. We believe that Wells Fargo will exercise its put option in December 2027 for nominal consideration, resulting in our becoming the sole owner of the investment fund, cancelling the related loans, and recognizing an estimated gain of million.

 to years for land improvements, to years for buildings and to years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements and capitalized leases are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term. Gains and losses upon disposition are reflected in operating results in the period of disposition. 
 Direct internal and external costs to implement computer systems and software for internal use are capitalized. Capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the system or software, generally six years, beginning when the system or software is ready for its intended use. 
 Liabilities are recognized at fair value for asset retirement obligations related to plant and landfill closures in the period in which they are reasonably estimable and the carrying amounts of the related long-lived assets are correspondingly adjusted. Over time, the liabilities are accreted to their estimated future values. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, asset retirement obligations were million.

Liabilities, including those related to claims incurred but not reported, are recorded principally using annual valuations based on discounted future expected payments and using historical data combined with insurance industry data when historical data is limited. Our gross workers compensation liabilities were million as of September 30, 2023, and we expect to recover million in insurance which is included as a receivable in Other current assets and Other noncurrent assets.

Performance Obligations 
 A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Our performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time as related to sales of equipment and products or over time as related to our software hosting and leak detection monitoring services. Performance obligations are supported by customer contracts, which provide frameworks for the nature of the distinct products or services. The transaction price is adjusted for our estimate of variable consideration which may include discounts, and rebates. To estimate variable consideration, we apply the expected value or the most likely amount method, based on whichever method most appropriately predicts the amount of consideration we expect to receive. The method applied is typically based on historical experience and known trends. We constrain the amounts of variable consideration that are included in the transaction price, to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when uncertainties around the variable consideration are resolved. 
 We exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority. 
 
 We do not adjust the transaction price of a contract for the effects of a significant financing component if, at the inception of the contract, we expect that the period between when we transfer a product or service to a customer and when a customer remits payment will be one year or less. 
 Revenues from products and services transferred to customers at a point in time represented of our revenues in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021. The revenues recognized at a point in time related to the sale of our product s and services are recognized when the obligations of the terms of our contract are satisfied, which is when the customer is able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the product or service, which generally occurs upon shipment when control of the product or service transfers to the customer. 
 Revenues from products and services transferred to customers over time represented of our revenues in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021. 
 We offer warranties to our customers in the form of assurance-type warranties, which provide assurance that the products provided will function as intended and comply with any agreed-upon specifications. These cannot be purchased separately. We offer extended warranties on limited products which may be purchased separately.

 Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets 
 Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis on September 1 of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. We performed our annual impairment testing at September 1, 2023 based on quantitative factors and concluded impairment losses should be recognized. 
 Intangible Assets 
 Direct internal and external costs to develop software used in the provision of services to customers by Water Management Solutions are capitalized and amortized over th e six -year estimated useful life o f the software, beginning when the software is ready for its intended use. At September 30, 2023, the remaining weighted-average amortization period for this software was years. Amortization expense related to such software assets was million in 2023 and 2022, and million in 2021. Amortization expense for each of the next five years is expected to be million in 2024, million in 2025, million in 2026, million in 2027, and million in 2028. 
 At September 30, 2023, the remaining weighted-average amortization period for business combination-related finite-lived customer relationships and technology intangible assets were years and years, respectively. Amortization expense related to these assets was million, million and million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense for each of the next five years is scheduled to be million in 2024, million in 2025, million in 2026, million in 2027 and million in 2028.

 Non-U.S. Income before income taxes 
 
 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act imposed a one-time transition tax on the undistributed, previously untaxed, post-1986 foreign earnings and profits as defined by the Internal Revenue Services IRS of certain United States-owned corporations. At September 30, 2023, the remaining balance of our transition obligation is million, which will be paid in full by January 2026, as provided in the Act. Other than for Krausz s investment in its United States subsidiary and other anticipated distributions which result cumulatively in immaterial income tax, we have not recorded income taxes for unrepatriated foreign earnings that may be subject to withholding tax or any outside cost basis differences inherent in our foreign subsidiaries, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. We have a foreign tax credit carryforward of million, for which we have recorded a valuation allowance as we do not expect to utilize it prior to expiration. 
 The federal income tax returns for Mueller Water Products, Inc. are closed for years prior to our fiscal year 2020. We remain liable for any taxes related to U.S. Pipe income for periods prior to 2012 pursuant to the terms of the sale agreement with the purchaser of the business. 
 Our state income tax returns are generally closed for years prior to our fiscal year 2020, except with regard to our state net operating loss carryforwards. Our Canadian income tax returns are generally closed for years prior to our fiscal year 2016. We do not have any material unpaid assessments .

 Substantially all unrecognized tax benefits would, if recognized, impact the effective tax rate. We recognize interest related to uncertain tax positions as interest expense and recognize any penalties incurred as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses.

million in borrowings that expires on July 29, 2025. Included in the ABL is the ability to borrow up to million of swing line loans and up to million of letters of credit. The ABL permits us to increase the size of the credit facility by an additional million in certain circumstances subject to adequate borrowing base availability. 
 On April 5, 2023, we amended the ABL. This amendment replaced LIBOR-based loans with Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR based loans plus an adjustment of basis points, among other immaterial modifications. In December 2023, we obtained a waiver under our ABL to provide for additional time associated with certain deliverables which were delayed as a result of the cybersecurity incident. The maximum aggregate amount of borrowings and other credit extensions under the ABL is limited to 50.0 million at any time outstanding until all of the delayed deliveries required under the ABL are made. 
 Borrowings under the ABL bear interest at a floating rate equal to SOFR plus an adjustment of basis points and an applicable margin range of to basis points, or a base rate, as defined in the ABL, plus an applicable margin range of to basis points. At September 30, 2023, the applicable margin was basis points for SOFR-based loans, and basis points for base rate loans. 
 The ABL is subject to mandatory prepayments if total outstanding borrowings under the ABL are greater than the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility or if we dispose of overdue accounts receivable in certain circumstances. The borrowing base under the ABL is equal to the sum of (a) of the value of eligible accounts receivable and (b) the lesser of (i) of the value of eligible inventory or (ii) of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory, less certain reserves. Prepayments can be made at any time without penalty. 
 Substantially all of our United States subsidiaries are borrowers under the ABL and are jointly and severally liable for outstanding borrowings. Our obligations under the ABL are secured by a first-priority perfected lien on all of our United States inventory, accounts receivable, certain cash balances and other supporting assets. 
 The ABL includes a commitment fee for any unused borrowing capacity of basis points per annum. Borrowings are not subject to any financial maintenance covenants unless excess availability is less than the greater of million and of the Loan Cap as defined in the ABL. Excess availability based on September 30, 2023 data was million, as reduced by million of outstanding letters of credit and million of accrued fees and expenses. 
 4.0 Senior Unsecured Notes. On May 28, 2021, we privately issued million of 4.0 Senior Notes, which mature on June 15, 2029 and bear interest at , paid semi-annually in June and December. We capitalized million of financing costs, which are being amortized over the term of the 4.0 Senior Notes using the effective interest method. Proceeds from the 4.0 Senior Notes, along with cash on hand were used to redeem our previously existing 5.5 Senior Notes. Substantially all of our United States subsidiaries guarantee the 4.0 Senior Notes, which are subordinate to borrowings under our ABL. Based on quoted market prices, which is a Level 1 measurement, the outstanding 4.0 Senior Notes had a fair value of million as of September 30, 2023. 
 An indenture securing the 4.0 Senior Notes Indenture contains customary covenants and events of default, including covenants that limit our ability to incur certain debt and liens. There are no financial maintenance covenants associated with the Indenture. We believe we were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2023. 
 
 We may redeem some or all of the 4.0 Senior Notes at any time prior to June 15, 2024 at certain make-whole redemption prices and on or after June 15, 2024, at specified redemption prices. Additionally, we may redeem up to 40 of the aggregate principal amount of the 4.0 Senior Notes at any time prior to June 15, 2024 with the net proceeds of specified equity offerings at specified redemption prices as set forth in the Indenture. Upon a change of control as defined, we would be required to offer to purchase the 4.0 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101 of the outstanding principal amount. 
 
 5.5 Senior Unsecured Notes. On June 12, 2018, we privately issued million of 5.5 Senior Notes, which were set to mature in June 2026 and bore interest at , paid semi-annually. We called the 5.5 Senior Notes effective June 17, 2021 and redeemed the 5.5 Senior Notes with the proceeds from the 4.0 Senior Notes and cash on hand. As a result, we incurred million in loss on early extinguishment of debt, comprised of a million call premium and a million write-off of the remaining deferred financing costs.

 Weighted average used to determine net periodic cost: 
 Discount rate 
 Expected return on plan assets 

The discount rates for determining the present value of pension obligations were selected using a bond settlement approach, which constructs a hypothetical bond portfolio that could be purchased such that the coupon payments and maturity values could be used to satisfy the projected benefit payments. The discount rate is the equivalent rate that results in the present value of the projected benefit payments equaling the market value of this bond portfolio. Only high quality (AA graded or higher), non-callable corporate bonds are included in this bond portfolio. We rely on the Pension Plan s actuaries to assist in the development of the discount rate model. 
 The expected return on plan assets is determined with the assistance of the Pension Plan s actuaries and investment consultants. Expected return on plan assets was developed using forward-looking returns over a time horizon of approximately years for major asset classes along with projected risk and historical correlations.

 Assets of the Pension Plan are allocated to various investments to attain diversification and reasonable risk-adjusted returns while also managing the exposure to asset and liability volatility. These ranges are targets and deviations may occur from time to time as a result of market fluctuations. Portfolio assets are typically rebalanced to the allocation targets at least annually. 
 The assets of the Pension Plan are primarily invested in mutual funds and investment trusts valued at net asset value, which in turn hold fixed income and equity investments. The valuation methodologies used to measure the assets of the Pension Plan at fair value are: 
 Mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market; 
 Fixed income fund investments held by the investment trusts are valued using the closing price reported in the active market in which the investment is traded. When market quotations are not readily available, these assets are valued by a method the trustees believe accurately reflects fair value.

shares of common stock that may be granted through the issuance of stock-based awards. Any awards canceled are available for reissuance. Generally, all of our employees and members of our Board of Directors are eligible to participate in the 2006 Plan. At September 30, 2023, shares of common stock were available for future grants of awards under the 2006 Plan. This total assumes that the maximum number of shares will be earned for awards for which the final number of shares to be earned has not yet been determined. 
 An award granted under the 2006 Plan vests at such times and in such installments as set by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors Compensation Committee ), but no award will be exercisable after the -year anniversary of the date on which it is granted. Management expects some instruments will be forfeited prior to vesting. Grants to members of our Board of Directors are expected to vest fully. Based on historical forfeitures, we expect certain grants to employees to be forfeited at an annual rate of . 
 Restricted Stock Units. Depending on the specific terms of each award, restricted stock units generally vest ratably over the life of the award, usually three years, on each anniversary date of the original grant. Compensation expense for restricted stock units is recognized between the grant date and the vesting date (or the date on which a participant becomes Retirement-eligible, if sooner) on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award. Fair values of restricted stock units are determined using the closing price of our common stock on the respective grant date.

 Performance-Based Awards. Our performance-based awards consist of performance-based restricted stock units PRSUs ). PRSUs represent a target number of units that may be paid out at the end of a multi-year award cycle consisting of annual performance periods coinciding with our fiscal years. As determined at the date of award, PRSUs may settle in cash-value equivalent of, or directly in, shares of our common stock. Settlement will range from to times the number of PRSUs granted, depending on our financial performance against predetermined targets. The grant date for each year s performance period is set when the Compensation Committee establishes performance goals for the period, normally within 90 days of the beginning of each performance period. At the end of each annual performance period, the Compensation Committee confirms performance against the applicable performance targets. PRSUs do not convey voting rights or earn dividends. PRSUs vest on the last day of an award cycle, unless vested sooner as a result of a Change of Control of the Company, or the death, disability or retirement of a participant. 
 We recognize compensation expense for stock-settled PRSUs starting on the first day of the applicable performance period and ending on the respective vesting dates. We base the recognized compensation expense upon the number of units awarded for each performance period, the closing price of our common stock on the grant date and the estimated performance factor. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, 282,47 , shares and shares, respectively, vested related to PRSUs.

 Market-Based Awards. Our market-based awards consist of market-based restricted stock units MRSUs ).

Settlements in our common shares, will range from to times the number of MRSUs granted, depending on our TSR performance ranking within the peer group. The fair values of MRSUs are fixed at the date of grant and the related expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period, which is roughly three years from the date of grant.

Notices. All notices, requests, demands, and other communications hereunder shall be sufficient if in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered by hand or if sent by registered or certified mail to Executive at the last address he filed in writing with the Company or, in the case of the Company, at its principal office. d.

Further, the captions of this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force and effect. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the 

-14- Company shall have no obligation to make any payment to Executive hereunder to the extent, but only to the extent, that such payment is prohibited by the terms of any final order of a federal or state court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that such an order shall not affect, impair, or invalidate any provision of this Agreement not expressly subject to such order. f. Modification. No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived, or discharged unless such modification, waiver, or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by Executive and by a member of the Board, as applicable, or by the respective parties legal representatives or successors, except as provided in Article I, Section 9(c). g. Applicable Law. To the extent not preempted by the laws of the United States, the laws of the State of Georgia shall be the controlling law in all matters relating to this Agreement without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws. h.

Executive expressly consents to the exercise of personal jurisdiction over Executive by the courts in the State of Georgia. Executive hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection or defense that a Georgia court does not have personal jurisdiction over Executive, is an improper venue, or constitutes an inconvenient forum. i. Indemnification. During the term of this Agreement and thereafter, the Company shall indemnify Executive and hold Executive harmless from and against any claim, loss or cause of action arising from or out of Executive s performance as an officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates or in any other capacity, including any fiduciary capacity, in which Executive serves at the Company s request, in each case to the maximum extent permitted by law and under the Company s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

-16- modifying or correcting the award, on any ground referred to in the Federal Arbitration Act, or where the findings of fact are not supported by substantial evidence, or where the conclusions of law are erroneous. 10. The provisions of this Article are severable, meaning that if any provision in this Article IV is determined to be unenforceable and cannot be reformed under applicable law, the remaining provisions shall remain in full effect, provided however, that any amendment of an unenforceable provision shall only be to the extent necessary and shall preserve the intent of the parties hereto. It is agreed and understood that the scope of this Article, including questions of arbitrability of any dispute, shall be determined by the arbitrator. 11.

8 with the Company or its successor following the Change in Control (or, in lieu of equity securities, the Replacement Award represents the cash equivalent of the Replaced Award); and (4) its other terms and conditions are not less favorable to Executive than the terms and conditions of the Replaced Award and this Agreement, including the requirement for immediate full vesting and lapse of all restrictions (including performance restriction which shall be deemed satisfied at target performance without proration) in the event Executive has a Qualifying Termination after receiving the Replacement Award. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Replacement Award may take the form of a continuation of the Replaced Award if the requirements of the preceding sentence are satisfied. The determination of whether the conditions of this Section 2.3(d)(ii)(A) are satisfied shall be made by the Committee, as constituted immediately before the Change in Control. Any disagreement between the Committee and Executive regarding whether the conditions of this Section 2.3(d)(ii)(A) are satisfied shall be subject to the dispute resolution requirements of Section 8.2. (B) Timing of Payout. With respect to any equity-based long- term incentive awards that become vested upon the date of a Change in Control pursuant to Section 2.3(d), shares of common stock attributable to such awards shall be delivered to Executive within 30 days following the date of the Change in Control; provided, if such award is subject to Section 409A and the Change in Control is not a change in control event (as defined in Section 409A), payment of the shares shall be made within 30 days after Executive s separation from service (as defined in Section 409A). With respect to any Replacement Awards that become vested upon a Qualifying Termination after the Change in Control, shares of common stock attributable to the Replacement Awards shall be delivered within 30 days following Executive s Qualifying Termination. The Committee shall determine on what date within the 30-day payment period actual payment shall be made. (e) The Company will allow Executive to elect to continue medical and dental coverage for Executive and Executive s eligible dependents (for the same coverages as provided to its active employees) for a period of 18 months (the COBRA Period following Executive s Effective Date of Termination, provided Executive (i) timely elects COBRA continuation coverage, and (ii) timely pays the applicable COBRA premiums, subject to the rules and limitations that apply to COBRA coverages. As part of the Severance Benefits, Executive shall be paid during the COBRA Period an amount each month equal to 150 of the applicable monthly COBRA rate for the coverage that is elected, reduced by applicable withholdings. For this purpose, the applicable COBRA rate is the cost of COBRA coverage, determined as of Executive s Effective Date of Termination, for the level of medical and/or dental coverage Executive has in effect on Executive s Effective Date of Termination; provided, however, this DocuSign Envelope ID: 0CE76AED-8640-4872-8DD1-975014C2C604 

9 monthly payment shall cease and shall not be payable after the month in which Executive ceases to be eligible for COBRA coverage. At the end of the COBRA Period and provided COBRA coverage has not been terminated earlier, the Company will provide Executive with the right to elect coverage under the Company s group medical and dental plans for active employees at a monthly cost equal to the then COBRA rate for a period of up to 24 months (the Extended Coverage Period ), provided, however, the Company s obligation to offer Executive the right to elect such coverages and the Extended Coverage Period shall cease upon the date Executive becomes eligible for coverage under another employer provided group health plan, including an employer of Executive s spouse, whether or not Executive elects such coverage. If, during the Extended Coverage Period, the Company significantly decreases the benefits provided under the group medical and dental plans or significantly increases the monthly costs for the coverages, in either such event, the Extended Coverage Period will cease and the Company will pay Executive a lump sum amount within 30 days of such event equal to 150 of the monthly cost Executive was paying for the coverages multiplied by the number of months that remained in the Extended Coverage Period. (f) From Executive s Effective Date of Termination until the earlier of (i) 24 months following such date of termination or (ii) the date immediately prior to the date of Executive s employment with a subsequent employer, the Company will provide Executive with outplacement services from a nationally recognized outplacement firm selected by Executive, subject to the limits described in this subsection. The aggregate amount paid by the Company for outplacement services will not exceed an amount equal to 35 of Executive s Base Salary as of Executive s Effective Date of Termination (the Total Outplacement Value ). (g) The Company will continue at its expense Executive s group life insurance coverage for a period of 18 months following Executive s Effective Date of Termination on the same terms and conditions and in the same amount as prior to termination of employment. 2.4 Best-Net Benefit and Compliance with Section 280G of the Code. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement to the contrary, if any of the Severance Benefits or any other payment or benefit under this Agreement, under any other agreement between Executive and the Company, or pursuant to any plan, arrangement, program or policy of the Company (in the aggregate, the Aggregate Payments constitute parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and, but for this Section 2.4, would result in Executive being subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any successor provision thereto, such Aggregate Payments will be reduced to the least extent necessary such that no portion of the Aggregate Payments will be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto; provided, that such a reduction will be made only if, by reason of such reduction, Executive s net after-tax benefit exceeds the net after-tax benefit Executive would realize if such reduction were not made. The Company and Executive shall at all times act in good faith to fully carry out the purposes and intent of this Section 2.4, including any action as may be necessary or appropriate to correct any calculation error which may be discovered subsequent to any payment DocuSign Envelope ID: 0CE76AED-8640-4872-8DD1-975014C2C604 

10 pursuant to this Section 2.4. Any reduction applied pursuant to this Section 2.4 hereof shall be made in the order that would provide Executive with the largest amount of after-tax proceeds.

11 treated as a right to a series of separate payments, (iii) each such payment that is made within two and one-half months following the end of the calendar year that contains the date of the Executive s Effective Date of Termination is intended to be exempt from Code Section 409A as a short-term deferral within the meaning of the final regulations under Code Section 409A, (iv) each such payment that is made later than two and one-half months following the end of the calendar year that contains the date of Executive s Effective Date of Termination is intended to be exempt under the two-times pay exception of Treas.

This hard work has yielded consistent, long- term success. We continue to gain new customers and expand relationships with existing customers while developing some of the industry s most advanced technological solutions. Companies that endure are built on a foundation and commitment to a set of shared values. To be a strong company on the outside, we have to be a strong company on the inside. Mueller continues to thrive not only as an industry leader, but as a company that embraces the highest levels of ethical standards. Our core values define the Mueller Way. They are at the forefront of the way we do business, the way we conduct ourselves and the way we treat others. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is an important part of this commitment. Our responsibility goes beyond fulfilling legal requirements. As employees, we all have a duty to uphold the code, company policies, company values and the law by performing our jobs in an open and honest manner. Our Code is designed to help guide you in your role as a Mueller team member.

CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS ETHICS IS GOOD BUSINESS Our Code is built on the foundation of our Core Values and outlines the standard of conduct that applies to everyone who works for or represents our Company. Acting ethically is not only the right thing to do, it is also good business. Compliance with our Code will: protect our reputation, facilitate business strategies, and save us money. Put another way our continued business success depends on our customers and stockholders respecting us for our honesty and integrity as much as it does on how we produce products and deliver services. WHO MUST FOLLOW OUR CODE All directors and employees of Mueller Water Products, Inc. and its subsidiaries are expected to carefully read and adhere to our Code. We also expect all of our contractors, consultants, representatives, agents and others working temporarily for or providing services to us to comply with this Code in connection with any work or services performed on our behalf. Our managers have a special responsibility to lead by example. Managers must instill a culture of integrity and ethical business practices and cannot ignore violations or potential violations of our Code. When each of us follows our Code, we communicate our commitment to the values that have made our business admired as a good partner and place to work. It is important to note, however, that violations of our Code, or the policies and guidelines applicable to our employees, could result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, criminal prosecution, or both. We have operations in countries around the world, and our employees are citizens of these various countries. As a result, our operations are subject to a diverse set of local laws and cultures. Employees are expected to comply with our Code and all applicable laws and regulations. If local law ever conflicts with our Code, contact the Compliance Office or Legal Department. Q A Something doesn t feel right to me, but I don t feel comfortable approaching my manager. What should I do? Contact our Chief Compliance Officer, your local human resources representative or use the Helpline. Trust your sense of integrity; if something doesn t feel right, you should seek guidance. Remember that in most cases your own good judgment is the best gauge when facing a potential ethical issue. USING OUR CODE Our Code is designed to provide a broad overview and scenarios on how to conduct our business in a manner consistent with our Core Values. It cannot cover every potential scenario you may encounter. The table of contents on page 1 will help you locate and identify any issue of concern. Our Code is divided into five sections, four of which include issue-specific subsections. To help you develop a more complete understanding of a given topic, we have included summary boxes within some topics, along with frequently asked questions. Our Code is available at http://ir.muellerwaterproducts.com/ corporate-governance/governance-documents. Our Code does not set forth all applicable policies and guidelines. Use our Code as a guide in addition to other Company policies and procedures to make good decisions. Remember, you should use good judgment and seek guidance when you need clarity. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our policies or guidelines, please do not hesitate to utilize any of the resources described in this document. 3 

GETTING ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS OR REPORTING A CONCERN If you have questions after reading our Code or any other policy or guideline applicable to your job responsibility, resources are available to assist you. We encourage all employees and others who support our business to ask questions, seek guidance, express concerns and report any suspected violations of our Code, our policies or applicable laws and regulations. Depending on your concern, it is often best to speak first with your immediate manager or a supervisor since she or he may be best placed to respond to your issue immediately. If you are not able to get an answer to a question or resolve an issue under our Code by working with your immediate manager or supervisor, or if you feel uncomfortable talking with them for any reason, please contact one of the following resources: Our Compliance Office or Chief Compliance Officer at (770) 206-4200 or compliance@muellerwp.com; Your local human resources representative or an attorney in our Legal Department; or The Mueller Helpline at 1-800-569-9358 or online at www.muellerwaterproducts.ethicspoint.com. If you select the online option you ll be able to submit your questions or concerns in a variety of languages. Once a report or concern is raised, we will investigate it promptly and thoroughly. We expect all our employees to cooperate in investigations fully and truthfully. Deliberate withholding of information, providing false or misleading information, destroying information or documents or refusing to participate is prohibited. We will take appropriate corrective action, including termination, if applicable, based on the findings of the investigation. APPROVAL, AMENDMENT AND WAIVERS Our Code has been approved by our board of directors. Any substantive amendments to our Code must be approved by the board of directors or an appropriate committee of the board of directors. You may request a waiver of a provision of our Code by contacting our Chief Compliance Officer. A waiver request submitted by an officer or director must be approved by our board of directors. NO RETALIATION POLICY You can raise questions or concerns or participate in the investigation process without fear of retaliation. Our strict no retaliation policy supports our commitment to you. Without exception, we prohibit retaliation against anyone who reports a violation or suspected violation of our Code or any of our policies in good faith. If you believe you are being retaliated against, contact our Chief Compliance Officer immediately. Q A What can I do if I believe someone is retaliating against me for reporting a matter to our Compliance Office or my human resources representative? Report it to our Chief Compliance Officer immediately. Retaliation is a violation of our Code, and appropriate action will be taken to stop any retaliation and prevent future occurrences. If you have knowledge of any activity that is or may be a violation of our ethics or standards of business conduct, you must report that activity promptly to your manager, a supervisor, your human resources representative or our Compliance Office. You may also use the Helpline. That said, intentionally submitting false or misleading allegations might harm the reputation of an employee, director or the Company. This type of activity demonstrates a lack of respect for your colleagues and is a serious offense that may result in termination. 4 

WE ARE COMMITTED TO EACH OTHER We want employees to have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential. This section of our Code outlines what is expected from each of us in our personal conduct and treatment of others to ensure an inclusive, supportive work environment. HEALTH AND SAFETY Our highest priority is to protect the health, safety, and well- being of our employees and those who visit our facilities or offices. Your health and safety are important to us. They are also important to your family, colleagues, and community. We protect your health and safety by implementing policies that help individuals safeguard themselves and their colleagues. The work we perform and the environment in which we work may present health and safety risks. You play an important role in our commitment to employee health and safety by maintaining a safe work environment. Please ensure that you, as well as all others, use personal safety equipment when required and adhere to all health and safety rules and regulations. You should immediately report any known or suspected unsafe conditions, hazard, or workplace injury to your local environment, health and safety representative or our Compliance Office. See our various environment, health and safety policies and procedures for more information. Q A My plant manager suggested adopting a practice that will save time, but poses a potential safety risk. What should I do? Report it to another leader, your local environment, health and safety representative or our Compliance Office. Never compromise your safety or the safety of your team members or others. FAIR TREATMENT / ANTI-DISCRIMINATION Everyone deserves to be treated fairly. We respect your dignity and expect you to act in a fair and equitable manner toward colleagues, customers, and others with whom you come in contact. We are committed to fair treatment in all aspects of employment for employees and applicants. Employment with us is based solely on individual merit and qualifications directly related to how well you do your job. We prohibit unlawful discrimination of any kind, including discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, age, national origin, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, veteran status, pregnancy, disability or any other basis prohibited by local laws or regulations. Conduct that fails to illustrate appropriate respect for others violates our Core Values. Q A I overheard a manager say he would not promote an individual because the person is a different race. He also used a racial slur to describe the person. What should I do? Immediately contact your supervisor, human resources representative or our Compliance Office. We do not tolerate unlawful discrimination of any kind. INTIMIDATION / HARASSMENT / VIOLENCE You should expect a positive working environment. There is no room in our culture for intimidation or harassment in any work-related setting. Harassment includes behavior that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment, but can also consist of displays of written or graphic material of an inappropriate nature. Examples include yelling at or intimidating someone, threatening harm, making offensive jokes regarding someone s ethnicity, or making sexual advances. We prohibit unlawful harassment in any form, and you should report it if you observe or experience intimidating, offensive, or harassing behavior in the workplace. We are also committed to a violence-free work environment. We will not tolerate any level of violence, or threats of violence, in the workplace. Be alert to what is going on around you, observe good security practices and speak up about any threats of potential violence. We prohibit possession of any firearm, dangerous device or object, or dangerous or deadly weapon, including any material used in a way that threatens or inflicts bodily injury to another person, on all of our properties consistent with local law if you have concerns that someone may have a weapon on our property, report it immediately to your supervisor, human resources representative or our Compliance Office. CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS 5 

Q A My co-worker circulated an email that was offensive to me. What should I do? If you are not comfortable speaking directly with the co-worker, or if the co-worker does not stop sending these emails, contact your supervisor, human resources representative or our Compliance Office. DRUGS AND ALCOHOL Substance abuse is incompatible with the health and safety of our employees. Never engage in work if you are under the influence or impaired by any substance, including prescription medication(s) that may impact your ability to operate equipment or perform your job safely. We prohibit the use, possession, distribution, purchase, or sale of controlled substances on our premises, while conducting business or while operating our equipment. Controlled substances include illegal drugs and narcotics, prescription drugs obtained or used without a legal prescription, and other unlawful substances or materials. Similarly, we prohibit the consumption of alcohol on Company premises, unless in connection with an authorized Company event. The use of alcohol or any other substance that causes or contributes to unacceptable job performance or conduct in the workplace is also prohibited. Where allowed by law, we may conduct searches and test for drug and alcohol use. Q A I occasionally smell alcohol on the breath of my co-worker who operates machinery at our plant. Do I have an obligation to report my co-worker? Yes. Operating machinery while intoxicated or under the influence is extremely dangerous. We care about the health and welfare of our employees. You should report the incidents to your supervisor, human resources representative, or our Compliance Office. HUMAN RIGHTS AND LABOR PRACTICES We are committed to upholding fundamental human rights and believe that all human beings should be treated with dignity, fairness, and respect. We strive to promote inclusion in the workplace, engage with communities to build upon our understanding of potential human rights issues, and encourage our suppliers to treat their employees and to interact with their communities in a manner that respects human rights. We condemn human rights abuses and do not condone the use of slave or forced labor, human trafficking, child labor, the degrading treatment of individuals, physical punishment, or unsafe working conditions. All employees are required to understand and obey local laws, to report any suspected violations, and to act in accordance with our Core Values and Code. DATA PRIVACY All employees must exercise care and discretion in handling personal data and may not use or disclose it improperly. The way we handle this data is critical to our success, demonstrates our respect for others, and promotes trust with our business partners, employees, and customers. Personal data is information in paper or electronic format that can directly or indirectly identify an individual including employees, contractors, directors, shareholders, customers, or anyone else with whom we do business. Personal data should be processed only if there is a legitimate business reason to do so. Individuals who are not authorized to handle personal data are prohibited from doing so. Employees should collect and use only the personal data needed for the business task and all such data must be kept secured. Employees are responsible for complying with all privacy laws around the world, even if such laws are stricter than our own policies. 6 

WE ARE COMMITTED TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITIES We are committed to fair competition. Competition drives us to continue to develop new and better ways of doing business. We will continue to earn and maintain the trust of our customers by competing fairly, honestly, legally, and ethically wherever we operate. We are also committed to operating in an environmentally conscious and respectful manner. This section outlines what is expected from each of us in our dealings with our customers and communities. FAIR DEALING We are committed to the concept of fair and vigorous competition. We compete on the basis of the quality of the products and services we offer. Your role is to deal fairly with our customers, suppliers, business partners, competitors, and other stakeholders. You must not misrepresent facts, conceal information, abuse confidential information, or use manipulation to obtain an unfair advantage when conducting business. ANTITRUST We comply with all competition laws (called antitrust laws in some countries) in the markets where we do business. These laws vary by country, but generally prohibit competitors from restraining competition by, for example, price fixing, bid rigging, making tying arrangements, and dividing territories or customers. They also prohibit other anti-competitive practices, such as setting distributor resale prices or abusing dominant market positions. Given the complexity of competition laws, you should consult with our Compliance Office whenever: You have questions about your obligations under competition laws; or Before entering discussions or agreements with a competitor, customer, reseller, or supplier about any arrangement that could have the effect of limiting competition. You should be particularly careful when interacting with competitors. To avoid even the appearance of an agreement, you should never discuss with competitors such things as prices, terms of sale, territories, customers, and bids. Violations of antitrust laws can result in damage to the Company s reputation, severe monetary penalties, and criminal penalties for all parties involved. Please contact our Compliance Office or Legal Department to address any questions concerning obligations to comply with these matters. ANTI-CORRUPTION As a part of our day-to-day business throughout the world, our Company must abide by various anti-corruption laws. These anti- corruption laws generally prohibit us from offering, authorizing or receiving improper payments of value (i.e., bribes, kickbacks, or facilitation payments) for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. With these laws in mind, you must not give, accept, or promise to give or accept any payment that could be interpreted as intending to improperly influence a commercial or governmental transaction. Beyond avoiding a violation of these laws, you must avoid even the appearance of unlawful influence when dealing with government officials, regardless of competitive pressures or local practices. For purposes of this policy, the term government officials includes employees of state-owned or controlled enterprises. Given the complexity of anti-corruption laws, you should work with our Compliance Office or Legal Department to address any questions concerning obligations to comply with this policy. Q A I was recently at a trade association meeting and overheard a representative of a competitor talking about its pricing strategy. I immediately left the room. Was that the right thing to do? Yes. Removing yourself from the meeting reduces the risk that someone might think you were engaged in fixing prices or other inappropriate activity. Contact our Compliance Office to report the incident and do not share any of the information you may have heard at the meeting with any of your colleagues. CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS 7 

Q A A foreign customs official detains import product due to incorrect paperwork but offers to release the goods for payment. I was told this is customary in this country. Is it allowed? No. You must fix the paperwork and contact an attorney listed in our Anti-Corruption Policy. Providing money, gifts, or entertainment to the foreign official would violate U.S. laws, as well as laws of other countries. Because we can be held liable for payments made by third parties, we must thoroughly screen each outside party that we engage, directly or indirectly, to work with foreign governments or officials on our behalf. GIFTS AND ENTERTAINMENT Offering gifts to customers or potential customers could easily create the appearance of a conflict of interest. Examples of gifts include: meals, travel, and travel accommodations for business or personal purposes; tickets to sporting or cultural events; discounts not available to the general public; cash and cash equivalents like gift cards; and wine or alcohol. We treat gift-giving to customers or potential customers in the private sector differently from those in the public sector. For private sector customers or potential customers, we draw a distinction between lavish gifts, which are generally prohibited, and token non-cash gifts, which are generally permissible. Cash gifts, including gift cards, are never permitted. We define lavish gifts as those gifts that exceed, or might be expected to exceed, 250 in value per person. You must request and receive clearance from our Compliance Office before giving a lavish gift. For more information on the distinction between lavish gifts and token gifts, see WE ARE COMMITTED TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS Conflicts of Interest. The legal requirements related to business gifts, meals, and entertainment for public sector customers or potential customers are complex. Because of this complexity, we require you to seek and receive the written approval of an attorney in our Legal Department prior to offering any gift to public sector customers or potential customers, including governmental entities and government officials or representatives. This approval requirement applies to our employees as well as third parties acting on our behalf, including sales agents. TRADE We must comply with trade laws and regulations applicable to our international transactions. These trade laws and regulations govern a wide variety of activities, including: travel, the import of components from foreign suppliers, the export of finished goods to foreign customers, and the protection of intellectual property. For example, each item imported into the United States must be approved by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in advance. Before granting approval to enter the U.S., Customs will confirm the item s tariff coding, country of origin, safety with respect to U.S. animals and plants, and payment of appropriate duties. Each of our international transactions must comply with various trade restrictions throughout the world. For example, we cannot export products or services to countries that are embargoed by the U.S. government, nor can we sell to certain persons or entities. Some specific end uses are also prohibited. If you are in any way involved with importing or exporting our products or services, you must ensure that you: have proper authorization before exporting or importing goods across national borders; know your customers and how they intend to use the products you sell them; and work with an attorney listed in our Trade Policy to be absolutely sure that the transaction is in compliance with applicable laws. Compliance with these laws is critical to maintaining the Company s reputation and success. 8 

Q A I work in sales. A distributor has contacted me about a bid that includes Buy America provisions. I think I know what this means. May I proceed? Various domestic laws and regulations promote purchases of certain goods manufactured in the United States. These laws and regulations are complex, and different standards apply to different programs. You should contact an attorney listed in our Trade Policy who will work with you to ensure that the products meet the applicable requirements. ENVIRONMENT We are proud of the role we play in ensuring that our communities have access to safe, clean drinking water by making quality products that are vital to sustainable water infrastructure. We are equally proud of our environmental stewardship in making those products and in running our business using modern sustainability principles. We strive to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. We are also committed to minimizing the impact of our business on the environment with methods that are socially responsible, scientifically based, economically sound, and sustainable. Our commitment to the environment extends to helping employees understand the environmental performance of our business and pursuing process modifications that prevent pollution, result in less waste, and minimize the use of natural resources. Following safe environmental practices is required by our policies and applicable law. It is also the right thing to do. We need your help in implementing our environmental policy. If you become aware of any situation that may negatively affect how our operations impact the environment, please discuss it with your local environment, health and safety representative. Q A I think certain of our manufacturing processes could be done in a different manner that would lessen their impact on the environment and potentially save the Company money. Would management like to hear my ideas? Yes. We value innovative ideas, especially those that enable us to prioritize safety and environmental responsibility, which is in keeping with our Core Values. Please contact your immediate supervisor or manager or your local environment, health and safety representative. POLITICAL ACTIVITIES AND CONTRIBUTIONS We encourage you to be a responsible citizen who participates in civic and political activities. However, any decision to become involved is entirely personal and voluntary. Your personal political activities must be done on your own time and with your own resources. At all times, you must make it clear that your views and actions are your own. Corporate political contributions are permitted only with the prior written approval of our Chief Compliance Officer, and only to the extent permitted by law. If you interact with government officials on the Company s behalf, you must familiarize yourself with the laws applicable to those interactions. ANTI-BOYCOTT Some countries have adopted laws prohibiting their citizens and businesses from participating in or cooperating with international trade embargoes or sanctions that have been imposed by other countries. We do not cooperate with foreign boycotts that are not approved by the U.S. government. If you receive a request related to any boycott, you should not respond, and you must contact the Legal Department immediately. CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS 9 

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING Money laundering is a global problem with serious consequences. We understand that criminal activity like money laundering may not always be obvious, so it is important that we work to reduce our exposure and speak up about anything suspicious. Money laundering is a process where funds generated through criminal activity, e.g., terrorism, drug dealing, human trafficking, or fraud, are passed through legitimate businesses. This gives the funds an appearance of legitimacy. We take steps to comply with anti-money laundering, financial crime, and antiterrorism laws in all countries where we operate. For example, we conduct appropriate due diligence and screening of our supplier and other business relationships. Anti-money laundering laws of the United States and other countries and international organizations require transparency of payments and the identity of all parties to transactions. We want all employees to be proactive in identifying financial transactions that might present a problem and encourage you to report your concern to the Legal Department if you suspect a transaction is outside of the normal process. WE ARE COMMITTED TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS We are committed to providing returns to our stockholders. However, under no circumstances will we sacrifice integrity for profits. We will comply with all applicable legal requirements and stock exchange rules relating to corporate organization, governance, and securities trading. Many people play a part in ensuring our compliance in these very important areas. This section of our Code outlines what is expected from each of us. ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING The integrity of our financial statements and other regulatory filings is non-negotiable. It is critical to successfully operating our business and to maintaining the confidence and trust of our stockholders, customers, business partners, and other stakeholders. Our business records must be accurate, truthful, and complete without restriction or qualification. Everybody involved with our financial reporting process plays a key role in our commitment to honestly and accurately record and report financial information. We depend on you to ensure that all transactions and balances are timely and accurately recorded, classified, and summarized in accordance with our financial and accounting practices. Never misrepresent our financial or operational performance or otherwise knowingly compromise the integrity of our financial statements. Do not enter information in our books or records that intentionally hides, misleads, or disguises the true nature of any financial or non- financial transaction, result, or balance. Our financial disclosures must be reasonable with the understanding that what we might not disclose can be just as important as what we disclose. If you are responsible for overseeing, operating or evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting, make sure you perform your duties in accordance with our policies, guidance, and instruction. If you are asked to provide, review, or certify information related to our internal controls, provide the information requested and otherwise respond in a full, accurate, and timely manner. Finally, be sure to retain, protect, and dispose of our financial records in accordance with applicable legal requirements and our information management policies. Q A I think a team member may have negotiated a contract that includes an unwritten side agreement that could prove detrimental to the Company. I don t know whether this side agreement is known to the people responsible for evaluating the Company s financial reporting obligations related to this contract. What should I do? Report the matter immediately to our Compliance Office or by using the Helpline. You may also notify the Company s Audit Committee at auditcommittee@ muellerwp.com. 10 

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST You have a responsibility to make decisions based on the interests of the Company without regard to how they might personally benefit you. A conflict may occur when your private or professional interests interfere in any way or even appear to interfere with the interests of the Company. Even if you did not intend for your actions to create a conflict of interest, the perception of a conflict by others can be just as damaging. If you are faced with a potential conflict of interest, ask yourself: Would this activity create an incentive for me, or be perceived by others to create an incentive for me, to benefit personally at the expense of the Company? Would this activity harm my reputation, negatively impact my ability to do my job, or potentially harm the Company? Would this activity embarrass the Company or me if it showed up on the front page of a newspaper or blog? If the answer is yes to any of these questions, then the relationship or situation may be likely to create a conflict of interest, and you should probably avoid it. Because conflicts of interest can sometimes be difficult to identify and assess, we have provided additional guidance below to address several areas where conflicts of interest often arise. If you are in a situation that may create a conflict of interest, or the appearance of a conflict of interest, review it with your direct supervisor or with our Compliance Office. Q A How do I know whether an activity I am engaged in outside of work creates an actual or potential conflict of interest? It is not possible to anticipate all circumstances that might signal potential conflicts. A conflict can arise when you take actions or have interests that may make it difficult to perform your Company work objectively and effectively. Contact your human resources representative or our Compliance Office if you are in doubt. OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT, BUSINESS VENTURES AND INVESTMENTS Your secondary employment, outside business ventures and other commercial or financial activities must not take away from your primary responsibility to the Company. Outside business activities may be conducted during non-working hours only and cannot interfere with your satisfactory work performance. You may not use Company equipment or resources in connection with these outside activities, and you must never engage in any outside employment or other activity that competes with the Company, violates your confidentiality or other obligations to the Company, or otherwise reflects negatively on the Company. Likewise, you may not use information about business opportunities learned from your role at the Company for your own or anyone else s benefit. You should also avoid making personal investments in companies that compete with the Company when the investment might cause, or appear to cause, you to act in a way that could harm the Company. FRIENDS AND RELATIVES You should avoid participating in a potential or existing business relationship between the Company and your relatives, spouse or significant other, or close friends. As a first step, you should disclose to your immediate supervisor any relationship you have with a friend or relative who is an employee or owner of a customer, supplier, or competitor of the Company, or a public or governmental official. You should not use your position within the Company to influence the hiring of a friend or relative; similarly, if a friend or relative is also an employee of the Company, you should not be in a position to influence employment or performance, compensation, or promotional decisions about the friend or relative. CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS 11 

Q A Why do close personal relationships pose a potential problem in business situations? In short, your judgment or loyalty to the Company may be compromised. For example, if you engage a friend or family member on behalf of the Company to conduct work or provide products and services to the Company, it may be difficult to balance your personal relationship with your duties and responsibilities to the Company. ACCEPTING GIFTS AND ENTERTAINMENT Accepting gifts from current or potential suppliers, vendors, or service providers can easily create the appearance of a conflict of interest. Examples of gifts include: meals, travel, and travel accommodations for business or personal purposes; tickets to sporting or cultural events; discounts not available to the general public; cash gifts including gift cards; vendor product samples for personal use; and wine or alcohol. We treat the acceptance of gifts from suppliers, vendors or service providers in the private sector differently from those in the public sector. For private sector suppliers, vendors, or service providers (or potential suppliers, vendors, or service providers), we draw a distinction between lavish gifts, which are generally prohibited, and token non-cash gifts, which are generally permissible. Cash gifts including gift cards are never permitted. For information related to giving gifts, see WE ARE COMMITTED TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITIES Gifts and Entertainment. The legal requirements related to business gifts, meals, and entertainment where a government official or representative is involved are complex and apply both to employees and representatives of the Company, including sales agents. You may not accept a gift or entertainment in any form or of any value from any governmental entity or government official or representative without seeking and receiving the prior approval of an attorney in our Legal Department. You should contact our Chief Compliance Officer if you have any questions. Lavish gifts (and all gifts that exceed or might be expected to exceed 250 in value) should be reported to our Compliance Office to determine whether the gift is appropriate. In addition, certain gifts should not be accepted under any circumstances, including loans from individuals or organizations dealing with the Company, cash gratuities, and private or personal discounts not approved by the Company. Gifts given with the intent to bribe, make a kickback, or place undue influence are, of course, illegal. We treat token non-cash gifts differently. We recognize that the occasional exchange of these sorts of small value gifts are a common business practice meant to provide a legitimate opportunity to interact, create goodwill and establish trust. Infrequent and moderate business meals and entertainment with clients, infrequent invitations to attend local sporting or cultural events, or gifts received during the holidays may be appropriate, provided that they are not lavish and do not create an appearance of impropriety. For example, you may be asked to play golf with a customer or vendor we recognize this is often an appropriate and normal way to conduct business in our industry. To be sure, you should pre-clear with our Compliance Office any gift that exceeds or is expected to exceed 250 in value. DEALING WITH SUPPLIERS Purchasing decisions must be made solely on the basis of quality, reputation, service, cost, and similar competitive factors. We caution against engaging in social relationships with current or prospective suppliers that may interfere with your ability to perform your job objectively or create an appearance of a conflict of interest. In dealing with suppliers, keep in mind the following best practices: Purchase materials and services fairly and impartially; reject the influence of bias or favoritism. Expenses related to attendance at a supplier sponsored event that provides a business opportunity for the Company should be paid by the Company, rather than the supplier. Solicitation or acceptance of a bribe, kickback, or similar consideration is illegal and constitutes grounds for immediate termination of employment. 12 

Q A My co-worker s sister is a representative for one of our suppliers. Should I report this relationship? Yes. Most likely this relationship will not create an issue, but to avoid a conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest, you should inform our Compliance Office. Full disclosure is the key to dealing with conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest. If you have a conflict of interest, or if you are ever in doubt as to whether a particular activity may be a conflict of interest, please contact our Compliance Office. GOVERNANCE OPPORTUNITIES You must obtain the approval of our Compliance Office or Legal Department prior to accepting any opportunity to serve as a director (or in a similar function) of a for-profit business. INSIDER TRADING Federal and state securities laws prohibit insider trading, and so do we. Insider trading means trading securities on the basis of material, non-public information or sharing this information with another person so they can trade. Information is considered material if a reasonable investor would consider it important to her or his decision to buy, hold, or sell the security. You may have access to inside information about the Company or other companies such as current or potential suppliers, customers, or acquisition targets. You are obligated to keep this information confidential, and you, your family members, and individuals with whom you have a significant personal relationship must never use this kind of information to trade in any company s securities. Likewise, you should never provide stock tips or share inside information with any other person who might use it to trade stock. In order to avoid the appearance that you may be trading on material, inside information, do not trade in Company securities during quarterly and other blackout periods when such restrictions apply to you. Even if you are not covered by formal blackout restrictions, you are encouraged to wait until at least 48 hours after material, non-public information has been publicly disclosed before trading to ensure the market has had an opportunity to absorb and evaluate the information. To the extent any questions arise, contact the Legal Department prior to making any trades in Company securities. The violation of insider trading laws is a serious crime and can result in significant civil and criminal penalties. Q A I heard from a team member that we are planning to acquire a publicly traded company, but it hasn t been announced yet. May I tell my friend to consider buying stock in the target company? No. Not only would this violate your confidentiality obligations to the Company, but you could also be charged with insider trading. RECORDS RETENTION AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT Our records are important assets and must be managed appropriately. Each of us is responsible for retaining, protecting, and appropriately disposing of Company records in accordance with applicable law and policy. The Company maintains records retention and information management policies detailing what, how, and for how long documents should be retained. Because we incur costs to retain our records, we have an interest in ensuring that we retain only those records that are relevant to our business. In addition, you may receive an instruction from time to time from an attorney in the Legal Department to preserve all documents that may be relevant to a particular legal matter. Please comply with these requests. CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS 13 

COMPANY ASSETS Our continued success depends on the effective use of available resources. We offer you access to the tools you need to do your job effectively, including facilities, furniture, supplies, equipment, and information technology resources. In return, we expect you to treat Company assets with care and respect and to guard against waste and abuse. Our assets should not be used for your personal benefit or for the benefit of other, non-Company related entities or persons. COMPUTER USE Use of our business networks is both a necessity and a privilege. If you have access to our information systems and computer networks, you are responsible for using the highest standards of behavior in all of your usage and communications. When you access our networks from remote locations, you are subject to the same standards of use as are employees who access our networks while on business premises. Our networks and information systems are for legitimate Company-related business purposes; limited personal use may be acceptable as approved in our policies and provided it does not interfere with your job responsibilities. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION Our intellectual property and other confidential information are valuable assets. Protecting this information is vital to our ability to effectively conduct our business. Intellectual property includes copyrights, patents, licenses, trademarks, and trade secrets. Confidential information includes contract terms, customer lists, proposals, project plans, business plans, processes, and other information that we have not released publicly, or which is not available through other public methods. As part of your work, intellectual property or confidential information may become available to you. Always be careful to protect confidential information belonging to the Company, as well as confidential information belonging to our customers, business partners, and other stakeholders. Take reasonable physical and electronic precautions to safeguard the information from a variety of threats, such as error, fraud, sabotage, industrial espionage, and privacy violations. Share confidential information only with employees who have a legitimate business need to know or with others who are covered by contractual non-disclosure agreements. Be very careful when talking about confidential information. Don t talk about it in public places and never share it with non-Company individuals, including family members and friends. Also, don t leave documents out in the open. You never know who may overhear a conversation or see sensitive printed material. Q A Our new team member has a lot of industry experience that we would like to use to our advantage. Is it okay for them to share with us what they know? Yes and no. It is okay and even helpful to learn from a new team member, but be careful. They can share their general knowledge and experience, but cannot share confidential information, trade secrets, or other intellectual property belonging to the former employer. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE Sharing material information with our stockholders, regulators, and the public at the right time, and in the right manner, is an important part of doing business as a public company. It is also required by law. As a public company, we regularly disclose material information through our filings with various regulatory agencies, press releases, annual reports, and earnings calls. We are committed to making all disclosures in a manner designed to provide appropriate access to material information for all stockholders, investors, and the public in a timely, non- selective manner. You play an important role in helping us to fulfill these obligations. If you are approached by, or receive a call from, the media or a member of the investment community, refer the caller to Corporate Communications or Investor Relations. We have designated a few employees, including our CEO and CFO, to speak on our behalf. This allows us to speak with a consistent voice. 14 

Q A A local newspaper reporter contacted me to ask me about the level of capacity utilization at our plant. How should I respond? Unless you have been given specific authority to speak about this topic on our behalf, you should refer the reporter to the Sr. Director of Marketing and Communications. SOCIAL MEDIA The way we communicate with each other continues to evolve with the rise of new media and next generation communications tools. While these changes create new opportunities for communication and collaboration, they also create new responsibilities for you. When using social media (e.g., online message boards, Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, YouTube, Twitter, etc.), you must take personal responsibility for your use of the social media and may not speak on behalf of the Company unless explicitly authorized to do so. We encourage you to pause and think before posting and never use social media to post about confidential Company information. You must ensure that you do not post content that would violate our Code or Company policies, or that includes the use of any Company copyright, logo or trademark without prior written consent from our Legal Department.

1 MUELLER WATER PRODUCTS, INC. INCENTIVE COMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY I. Introduction The Board of Directors (the Board of Mueller Water Products, Inc. (the Company has adopted this Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy (this Policy to comply with New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE Listed Company Rule 303A.14, which requires listed companies to provide for the recovery of certain erroneously awarded executive compensation in the event of an Accounting Restatement (defined below) resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the U.S. federal securities laws. II. Administration This Policy shall be administered by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the Committee of the Board of the Company. Any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding on all affected individuals. III. Definitions For purposes of this Policy, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below: (a) Accounting Restatement means an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S. federal securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial restatements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (sometimes known as a Big R restatement), or that corrects an error that is not material to previously issued financial statements, but would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (sometimes known as a little r restatement). (b) Covered Executives means the Company s current and former Executive Officers, as determined by the Committee in accordance with Section 10D of the Exchange Act and the listing standards of the NYSE, and such other senior executives and employees who may from time to time be designated by the Committee to be subject to this Policy. (c) Effective Date means October 2, 2023. (d) Erroneously Awarded Compensation means, with respect to each Covered Executive in connection with an Accounting Restatement, the amount by which Recovery Eligible Incentive-based Compensation exceeds the amount of Incentive-based Compensation that otherwise would have been Received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, computed in the gross amount without regard to any taxes paid or withheld, other payroll deductions or similar reductions in the gross amount. (e) Exchange Act means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

2 (f) Executive Officer means the Company s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice- president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person (including any executive officer of the Company s affiliates) who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. The term Executive Officer includes, without limitation, those officers identified by the Company in any disclosure made pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S-K Item 401(b). (g) Financial Reporting Measures means measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and all other measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock price and total shareholder return (and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from stock price or total shareholder return) shall for purposes of this Policy be considered Financial Reporting Measures. For the avoidance of doubt, a Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented in the Company s financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC. (h) Incentive-based Compensation means any compensation that is granted, is earned or becomes vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. (i) Received : Incentive-based Compensation shall be deemed Received in the Company s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-based Compensation award is deemed attained, even if payment or grant of the Incentive-based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. (j) Recovery Eligible Incentive-based Compensation means, in connection with an Accounting Restatement and with respect to each individual who served as a Covered Executive at any time during the applicable performance period for any Incentive-based Compensation (whether or not such Covered Executive is serving in such capacity at the time the Erroneously Awarded Compensation is required to be repaid to the Company), all Incentive-based Compensation Received by such Covered Executive (i) on or after the Effective Date, (ii) after beginning service as a Covered Executive, (iii) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association, and (iv) during the applicable Recovery Period. (k) Recovery Period means, with respect to any Accounting Restatement, the three completed fiscal years of the Company immediately preceding the Restatement Date and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years. (l) Restatement Date means the earlier to occur of the date (i) (A) the Board, (B) a committee of the Board, or (C) the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board or Board committee action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, and (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. 

3 (m) SEC means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. IV. Repayment/Forfeiture of Erroneously Awarded Compensation (a) In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Committee shall take reasonably prompt action after the Restatement Date to determine the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation for each Covered Executive in connection with such Accounting Restatement and, thereafter, shall promptly provide each Covered Executive with a written notice containing the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation and a demand for repayment or return, as applicable, on or before a stated deadline or, where the Erroneously Awarded Compensation has not become payable, a notice of its forfeiture. For Incentive-based Compensation based on (or derived from) stock price or total shareholder return where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable Accounting Restatement, the amount shall be determined by the Committee based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-based Compensation was Received (in which case the Company shall maintain documentation of such determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the NYSE). (b) The Committee shall have broad discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on all applicable facts and circumstances and taking into account the time value of money and the cost to shareholders of delaying recovery, including without limitation (i) requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive- based Compensation previously paid; (ii) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards; (iii) offsetting the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive; (iv) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards or other outstanding compensatory awards; and/or (v) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law. For the avoidance of doubt, except as set forth in Section IV(d) below, in no event may the Company accept an amount that is less than the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of a Covered Executive s obligations hereunder. (c) To the extent that a Covered Executive fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company (as determined in accordance with Section IV(b) above) when due (as determined in accordance with Section IV(a) above), the Company shall take all actions reasonable and appropriate to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the applicable Covered Executive. The applicable Covered Executive shall be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take the actions contemplated by Section IV(b) above if the following conditions are met and the Committee determines that recovery would be impracticable: 

4 (i) the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy against a Covered Executive would exceed the amount to be recovered, after the Company has made a reasonable attempt to recover the applicable Erroneously Awarded Compensation, documented such attempts and provided such documentation to the NYSE; (ii) recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022; provided that, before determining that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company has obtained an opinion of home country counsel (acceptable to the NYSE) that recovery would result in such a violation and a copy of the opinion is provided to the NYSE; (iii) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and the regulations thereunder; or (iv) recovery is not required under SEC Rule 10D-1 or the applicable NYSE listing rules. V. Acknowledgement by Covered Executives The Company shall provide notice of this Policy to, and seek written acknowledgement of this Policy from, each Covered Executive in such form as the Company determines to be appropriate; provided that the failure to provide such notice or obtain such acknowledgement shall have no impact on the applicability of this Policy notwithstanding any agreement to which the Covered Executive is a party. VI. Reporting and Disclosure. The Company shall make all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable listing standards. VII. No Indemnification Notwithstanding the terms of any of the Company s organizational documents, any corporate policy or any contract, the Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executive against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation or any claims relating to the Company s enforcement of its rights under this Policy nor shall the Company pay or reimburse any Covered Executive for any insurance premium to cover the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation. VIII. Interpretation The Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or standards adopted by the SEC or any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company s securities are listed. 

5 IX.
