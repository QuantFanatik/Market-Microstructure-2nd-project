PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. Business 
 
 Nature of Operations and Going Concern 
 
 APPlife Digital Solutions, Inc. (the Company was formed March 5, 2018, in Nevada and has offices in San Francisco, California and Shanghai, China. Our office in San Francisco, California allows us to take advantage of the marketing opportunities available in the United States as well as keeping close proximity to sources of capital whether it is debt or equity. Our offices in Shanghai, China allows us to take advantage of a high concentration of skilled tech coders and developers at lower capital costs than in more developed countries such as the United States or Europe. The Company s mission is using digital technology to create APPs and websites that make life, business and living easier, more efficient and just smarter. 
 
 We are a development stage company with a limited operating history, operations, and revenues and we will need to raise capital to implement our planned operations. If we are unable to do so, an entire investment in our stock could be lost. 
 
 The Company anticipates that it would need a minimum of approximately 1,500,000 over the next 12 months to continue as a going concern and bring the Company s ecommerce and/or cloud-based businesses to market and generate revenue within that time frame. Specifically, in order for the Company to fully implement its plans to create apps and spend the necessary marketing expenditures for them we will need: (1) 750,000 for marketing expenses, (2) 500,000 for general administration and overhead expenses, (3) 180,000 for legal and accounting expenses, and (3) 70,000 for developers and engineers and app and server maintenance expenses. If we are not able to raise enough funds, we may be forced to look for capital through debt or equity, which would dilute our common stockholders. 
 
 Products 
 
 As of the period from inception, through today s date, we have generated limited revenue and incurred expenses and operating losses, as part of our developmental stage activities in developing three apps, B2BCHX, ROOSTER and Office Hop. B2BCHX is our first fully developed app/mobile website that was available in iTunes App Store and Google Play and a formerly functioning ecommerce website. B2BCHX allows business owners around the world to order three levels of background checks on Chinese companies to prevent fraudulent business transactions. The retail price for each report is 79, 399 and 1,299. The model is not currently marketing for new customers as the laws in China that allowed the attorney partnership, we have in place to record information about Chinese companies and distribute overseas, has been suspended temporarily. 
 
 ROOSTER ESSENTIALS ecommerce website, mobile website. After creating a reactive mobile web-based platform, the value of the apps for this model disappeared and we cut o our losses quickly by removing the apps. The website developed and launched BETA operations in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 and launched its full commercial operations in the second quarter of 2022. ROOSTER ESSENTIALS is an online men s grooming supply store, and it allows men to fully customize which products they receive and set up an auto-delivery schedule for each product for automatic recurring delivery. ROOSTER ESSENTIALS currently carries over 200 products from over 80 brands. We anticipate the sources of revenue will come from product purchases, advertising, and sponsorships. 
 
 OFFICE HOP entered beta testing in the fourth quarter of 2021 and is now fully functional as of January 2022. We believe OFFICE HOP fits perfectly into the needs of the post Covid working world, where short-term offices and meeting rooms will be in high demand. The OFFICE HOP model is like Airbnb for short term shared or private office space and meeting rooms. Those offices that have an extra office, shared desk, an empty meeting room or conference room may list the space and act as a host for a user. Those users in need of a short-term shared desk, meeting room or private office may locate one on our platform and rent it out for use as needed by the hour, half day, full day, week or month. We will also offer access to creative spaces such as photo studios and pop-up art galleries and will offer restaurants with private rooms a way to rent out the space with a menu included for group or lunch meetings. The revenue is expected to come from the 10-15 service fee charged to Users for finding and making a transaction with one of our listed properties. The platform is global. We will begin operations in North America and Europe and then 
 4 
 
 eventually operate in South America and Asia. This launch was delayed due to capital needs, but the model is operational and can be taken to market quickly upon financing from our effective equity line of credit. 
 Global Hemp Services LLC is a low risk and low-cost participation in the fast-growing Hemp and CBD market space. We have licensed out our fully functional ecommerce platform in exchange for a 15 equity position and 2.5 revenue share, with exclusive rights to purchase an additional 36 of the equity (for a total of 51 upon reaching revenue benchmarks. Global Hemp Services LLC distributes Hemp and CBD products globally, including Hemp based building materials, textiles, plastics, paper, personal care items and various CBD products. They will distribute wholesale to shops and stores and retail directly to consumers. The model is starting to form a marketplace and as the interest in Hemp and Hemp products escalates, the website is seeing more activity. We expect good things in the fiscal year 2024 from GHS. 
 Lollipop NFT will have a new name and will now be known as Valida. We have changed the model initially presented for Lollipop. Formerly an online marketplace, consignment store, creator platform, and wallet, it is now intended to be what we call a super wallet. It is non-custodial and will be able to be connected through API directly to various marketplaces of the user s choice. We will focus on storing and sharing of NFTs that represent practical use. For example, we will focus on Driver s licenses, Diplomas, Real Estate escrow documents and title. The storage and ability to reference these valuable NFT documents as well as collections of NFT for storage will be available as the core model. The wallet will be a digital wallet, with cold storage for security. Once completed the system code will be audited by a third-party auditor and there will be multiple security daemons to monitor account login and asset transfers to protect the user. We have completed the design and preliminary development phase of this project, but have not yet begun writing the code. We plan to use the Polygon blockchain to create the wallet and have also lined up tech support with Polygon. We anticipate having a cold wallet system that allows the users to transfer between storage and active modes and plan to include 2FA, fingerprint and/or facial recognition technology. We plan to have multiple additional security daemons that review account holdings and prevent unauthorized transfers and withdrawals, however we may be liable for any cybersecurity breach resulting in the loss of customer assets. We plan to have multiple additional security daemons that review account holdings and prevent unauthorized transfers and withdrawals. The main focus of our user base will be practical use NFTs. We believe this is the future best use scenario for NFTs. This is what we believe will set us apart from those systems designed to buy and sell digital art and items that may be considered securities. We expect users to store their important documents and certifications in files. An example is we will allow universities to bulk upload diplomas into the system that will be an image of the certificate with the graduate s name in place. The Meta Data will show in a border area that discloses the name of the University, the degree, date of issue and an official University stamp. The User will have the option of receiving the NFT version by registering and then using a code provided by the school to download the diploma NFT into the wallet. This would also apply to Driver s licenses issued by State DMVs, Real Estate Broker licenses, Wills and other important legal documents, Escrow or Title paperwork. We are not intending on blocking people from storing other types of NFTs, but our format and storage UI is not appealing to those collecting digital art. Our interface will resemble a windows filing system. It is tailored to cater to file storage for the practical use type. 
 
 Our DRINX project is in early stage of development, and we believe the beta version will be ready by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. DRINX app allows anyone to purchase a virtual drink ticket anywhere and at any time for friends and colleagues. We anticipate the sources of revenue will come from advertising and sponsorships from alcohol companies promoting products on the app, user fee of 0.99 to send each drink and discounts provided by the bars and restaurants for purchases made by the app. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Although there are countless app and website developers and companies out there, we believe we have advantages over competitors. First our dual location of offices. Our business, management and marketing based in the U.S and our development team is located in Shanghai. Our creative team works in both places. Access to talent at a much more reasonable cost in Shanghai allows flexibility and that allows creativity to be explored more freely and makes completing projects with new or unique features much more likely. We can also finish faster and for less money and then focus dollars on marketing and obtaining customers. Second, our planned access to investment capital and filing to trade as a public company will allow us to not only build and develop our own concepts and ideas like any other app development company, but we will also be able to explore opportunities to invest in and participate in the growth 
 5 
 
 and development of other companies that are not our own in-house projects, which will hopefully give us the advantage of accelerated growth. 
 
 Marketing Strategy 
 
 Our marketing strategy is carefully built and tailored for each of our individual projects. Multiple projects in varying industries allows us to cast a wide net in attracting customers from different marketplaces globally. 
 
 Our completed project B2BCHX will be marketed as an anti-fraud or fraud prevention service when doing business with a Chinese company. The Company believes that globally, clients of Chinese businesses have no way to verify information or do a background check in a cost-effective way. B2BCHX helps prevent fraud by providing customers with a background check in an inexpensive, easy to read, one-page report. They can use the information for confidence when sending money, to verify what they have been told by the company staff or to try to track down a company that has not fulfilled the obligations to the customer. 
 
 The variations on the types of businesses we can develop allows our product to be sold across multiple market spaces. We are not limited to a single market or model. 
 
 The strategic partnerships with each of our individual in house projects are invaluable. For our Drinx app, which we plan to launch its Alpha version in the fall of 2023, Beta by winter 2024, and commercial launch in Spring 2024, we have collaborated with a well-known, long term New York City restaurateur and club owner, Lesly Bernard. His knowledge and market experience will allow New York City to be our base city in the Drinx service and expand from there. Bernard will consult and advise on the development of the look and feel of the app and will participate in the launch of the app in each city. He will lead project management and will be active in the marketing of the service. In exchange for his time and efforts, Bernard has agreed to take a minority equity position in the Drinx app. We are negotiating to bring in additional brand ambassadors and influencers including Natalia Bruschi. 
 
 We have also engaged an IR/PR team to help create marketing campaigns and create editorial content for each of our businesses as we launch. And soon OfficeHop and have paused the marketing campaign for B2BCHX to allow global factory orders to re-establish themselves post pandemic. We are currently in a soft launch of Rooster using with a well-timed and placed marketing campaign and plan to re-ignite the B2BCHX model and launch OfficeHop this fall. 
 
 Employees 
 
 We currently have one full time employee who does have a formal employment agreement. Matt Reid is technically the only employee of the Company, and he resides in Shanghai, China, in order to manage the independent contractor teams of developers the Company hires. We have an attorney in Shanghai engaged to help us with the contracts and negotiations with developers and other similar items. We have multiple independent contractor team members for the Company that live and work in the US who make up our business management and executive teams. They do not operate in China, and we generate no revenue in China. Our independent contractors fill positions such as Chief Legal Officer, Executive Project Director, Accountant and Investor relations manager and are all located in New York. Our Director of Marketing, PR agent and multiple lower-level independent contractors reside and work in California. None of the operating business models we have are generating any revenue from Chinese based businesses.

 Overview 
 
 APPlife Digital Solutions, Inc. (the Company was formed March 5, 2018, in Nevada and has offices in San Francisco, California and Shanghai, China. Our office in San Francisco, California allows us to take advantage of the marketing opportunities available in the United States as well as keeping close proximity to sources of capital whether 
 7 
 
 it is debt or equity. Our offices in Shanghai, China allows us to take advantage of a high concentration of skilled tech coders and developers at lower capital costs than in more developed countries such as the United States or Europe. The Company s mission is using digital technology to create and invest in eCommerce and Cloud based businesses that make life, business and living easier, more efficient, and just smarter. 
 
 Plan of Operation 
 
 Our marketing and business management/executive team will operate from both Shanghai China and our offices in San Francisco. Matt Reid is technically the only employee of the Company, and he resides in Shanghai, China, in order to manage the independent contractor teams of developers the Company hires. We have an attorney in Shanghai engaged to help us with the contracts and negotiations with developers and other similar items. We have multiple independent contractor team members for the Company that live and work in the US who make up our business management and executive teams. They do not operate in China, and we generate no revenue in China. Our independent contractors fill positions such as Chief Legal Officer, Executive Project Director, Accountant and Investor relations manager and are all located in New York. Our Director of Marketing, PR agent and multiple lower-level independent contractors reside and work in California. None of the operating business models we have are generating any revenue from Chinese based businesses. Currently 100 of our revenue comes from an ecommerce platform servicing US customers and there are no current plans to buy or develop any new Chinese based business models. 
 
 We will continue to explore new concepts and opportunities to invest in projects that meet our criteria We have incurred expenses and operating losses, as part of our activities in developing e-commerce platforms, B2BCHX, OFFICEHOP, ROOSTER ESSENTIALS, Valida and Global Hemp Service LLC. The capital we raise will go into marketing, acquisitions, and revenue generation. We believe this will take our vision forward and to the next level. 
 
 The APPlife Digital Solutions business model is two-fold. First, is to market our current in-house developed projects ecommerce and cloud based business over the next year, work to add partnerships and to add additional in-house developed projects including We plan to engage multiple resources such as adding staff, create partnerships, and as capital becomes available, to market and grow revenue. 
 
 The second, but equally important part of our business model is to target acquisitions and projects that can be assisted by our marketing and capitalization capabilities where we can play an active role in the project s success and make the acquisitions to add to our revenue stream. We seek acquisition targets that have a model that fits our vision and area of interest, is currently generating revenue with room for growth and a strong management team that will stay on board and continue to operate the entity post-acquisition. We have signed an asset purchase agreement to buy the assets around the operations of an online beauty company with revenue. 
 
 Our current projects: 
 
 B2BCHX is our first fully developed app that is available in Google Play and a functioning ecommerce and mobile website. B2BCHX allows business owners around the world to order three levels of background checks in English on Chinese companies to prevent fraudulent business transactions, to gather information in order to gain confidence when doing business with a Chinese entity or to pursue legal remedy against fraudulent Chinese Company. The reports are researched and written by a licensed law firm in Shanghai China in a partnership agreement with B2BCHX. These reports are not auto generated and are carefully researched to give our users the most accurate information. The retail price for each report is 79, 399 and 1299. The partnership with the law firm is on a 20 revenue share, which leaves B2BCHX an 80 per report profit margin to cover development expenses, maintenance and profit. We are waiting for a temporary law change that will allow the attorney to send information on Chinese entities overseas. 
 
 ROOSTER ESSENTIALS ecommerce website, has been operations in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 and launched its full commercial operations in the second quarter of 2022. ROOSTER ESSENTIALS is an online men s grooming supply store, and it allows men to fully customize which products they receive and set up an auto-delivery schedule for each product for automatic recurring delivery. ROOSTER ESSENTIALS currently carries over 200 products from over 80 brands. We anticipate the sources of revenue will come from purchases, advertising and sponsorships.

We anticipate the sources of revenue will come from advertising and sponsorships from alcohol companies promoting products on the app, user fee of 0.99 to send each drink and discounts provided by the bars and restaurants for purchases made by the app.

Results of Operations 
 
 Revenue 
 
 For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we generated revenues of 46,879 and 28,162, respectively. The Company has been in the process of marketing and developing its apps, hiring developers and coders, incurring professional fees for registering its common stock and identifying other apps and partnerships to generate revenues as the Company expands its operations. 
 
 Operating Loss 
 
 For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we had an operating loss of 3,130,998 and 3,010,159, respectively. The operating loss was due primarily to stock compensation to the CEO of 1,425,761, professional, consulting and legal fees of 698,888 and other stock compensation of 437,721. 
 
 Other Income/Expense 
 
 For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we had other expenses, net of 365,575 and 530,941, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the 274,919 gain on change in the fair value of the derivative liability. (Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 
 Net loss 
 
 We reported a net loss of 3,496,573 and 3,541,100 for the years ended June 30 , 2023 and 2022 , respectively. The net loss for the years ended June 30 , 2023 and 2022 included noncash expenses of 2,646,230 and 2,518,287, respectively.

We anticipate generating losses and, therefore, may be unable to continue operations in the future. If we require additional capital, we will have to issue debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party. The current liabilities of 1,442,548 include 1,004,846 of derivative liabilities which relate to the convertible notes payable and stock options. Upon exercise of the stock options and settlement of notes payable, the derivative liability will be reclassified as equity. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has minimal revenue generating operations and has an accumulated deficit of 16,874,404 and 13,377,831 as of June 30 , 2023 and 2022, respectively . In addition, the Company has experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The Company anticipates additional equity financing to fund operations in the future. Should management fail to adequately address the issue, the Company may have to reduce its business activities or curtail its operations.

Our cash balance was 57,619 on June 30, 2023. We recorded a net loss of 3,496,573 for the year ended June 30, 2023 . We expect our expenses will continue to increase during the foreseeable future as a result of increased operations and the development of our apps and business operations. We anticipate generating revenues with our B2BCHX app, but only minimal revenues for our other apps over the next twelve months. Consequently, we are dependent on the proceeds from future debt or equity investments to sustain our operations and implement our business plan. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we will be required to delay or forego some portion of our business plan, which would have a material adverse effect on our anticipated results from operations and consolidated financial condition. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary amounts of capital or that our estimates of our capital requirements will prove to be accurate. 
 
 We presently do not have any significant credit available, bank financing or other external sources of liquidity. Due to our operating losses, our operations have not been a source of liquidity. We will need to obtain additional capital in order to expand operations and become profitable. In order to obtain capital, we may need to sell additional shares of our common stock or borrow funds from private lenders. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional funding. 
 
 To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to existing stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. Regardless of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs, we may seek to compensate providers of services by issuance of stock in lieu of cash, which may also result in dilution to existing shareholders. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. 
 
 No assurance can be given that sources of financing will be available to us and/or that demand for our equity/debt instruments will be sufficient to meet our capital needs, or that financing will be available on terms favorable to us. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, we may not be able to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or may be required to reduce the scope of our planned marketing efforts and development of our apps, any of which could have a negative impact on our business and operating results. In addition, insufficient funding may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, which could require us to: 
 
 Curtail the development of our apps, 
 Seek strategic partnerships that may force us to relinquish significant rights to our apps, or 
 Explore potential mergers or sales of significant assets of our Company. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 During the year ended June 30, 2023, cash used in the Company s operating activities amounted to 677,614 mainly composed of the Company s net loss amounting to 3,496,573, adding back the (1) net effect of noncash adjustments of stock compensation expense, amortization of discount from notes payable, interest expense, common stock issuances, change in fair value of derivative liability and common stock payable amounting to 2,646,230 and (2) net changes in working capital accounts of 172,729. 
 
 During the year ended June 30, 2022, cash used in the Company s operating activities amounted to 884,412 mainly composed of the Company s net loss amounting to 3,541,100, adding back the (1) net effect of noncash adjustments of stock compensation expense, amortization of discount from notes payable, interest expense, common stock 
 11 
 
 issuances, change in fair value of derivative liability, common stock payable and gain on settlement of debt amounting to 2,518,287 and (2) net changes in working capital accounts of 138,401. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company raised 545,000 from the issuance of debt, and received 1,000 of amounts due to officer. 
 
 During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company raised 350,000 from the issuance of debt, 520,000 from the sale of common stock, repaid 40,000 of notes payable and repaid 6,428 of amounts due to officer. 
 
 Professional Fees 
 
 Professional fees were 226,783 and 168,948 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company generally expects professional fee costs to increase as the Company is a public reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which requires that it maintain relationships with both PCAOB registered audit firms and securities counsel to assist with the SEC reporting requirements. 
 
 In addition, the Company may also attempt to purchase other entities or assets and operations of other entities if the advantageous situation presents itself. This could require the Company to incur substantial professional fees. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). The Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K , describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. 
 
 Management believes the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, determination of fair value of stock-based compensation and determination of the fair value of the conversion feature of the convertible notes. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company s management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 The Company will recognize revenue from the sale of products and services in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. 
 
 Revenue from product sales is recorded at the net sales price, or transaction price, which includes coupons, discounts, and processing fees. The Company constrains revenue by considering factors that could otherwise lead to a probable reversal of revenue. Collectability of revenue is reasonably assured based on historical evidence of collectability between the Company and its customers. 
 
 We offer consumer products through our website. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which occurs upon shipment to the customer. 
 12 
 
 Stock Based Compensation 
 
 The Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provision of FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ASC 718 ), prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements based on the estimated grant date fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). 
 
 The Company accounts for share-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 505, Equity based Payments to Non-Employees ASC 505 ). Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date. 
 
 Derivative Liability 
 
 FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , requires all derivatives to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. As of June 30, 2023, we used the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model to estimate the fair value of the conversion feature of the convertible note. Key assumptions of the BSM model include the market price of our stock, the conversion price of the debt, applicable volatility rates, risk-free interest rates and the instrument s remaining term. These assumptions require significant management judgment. In addition, changes in any of these variables during a period can result in material changes in the fair value (and resultant gains or losses) of this derivative instrument. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company 
 
 We are an emerging growth company under the federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 We do not expect our sales to be impacted by seasonal demands for our products and services. 
 
 We are susceptible to general economic conditions, natural catastrophic events and public health crises, and a potential downturn in advertising and marketing spending by advertisers could adversely affect our operating results in the near future. 
 
 Our business is subject to the impact of natural catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, or floods, public health crisis, such as disease outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, and all these could result in a decrease or sharp downturn of economies, including our markets and business locations in the current and future periods. The outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) resulted in increased travel restrictions, and shutdown of businesses, which may cause slower recovery of the economy. We may experience impact from quarantines, market downturns and changes in customer behavior related to pandemic fears and impact on our workforce if the virus continues to spread. In addition, one or more of our customers, partners, service providers or suppliers may experience financial distress, delayed or defaults on payment, file for bankruptcy protection, sharp diminishing of business, or suffer disruptions in their business due to the outbreak. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments and reactions throughout the world, which are highly uncertain and will include emerging information 
 13 
 
 concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions taken by governments and private businesses to attempt to contain the coronavirus. It is likely to result in a potential material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Wider-spread COVID-19 globally could prolong the deterioration in economic conditions and could cause decreases in or delays in advertising spending and reduce and/or negatively impact our short-term ability to grow our revenues. Any decreased collectability of accounts receivable, bankruptcy of small and medium businesses, or early termination of agreements due to deterioration in economic conditions could negatively impact our results of operations.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 The Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
 Applife Digital Solutions, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Applife Digital Solutions, Inc. and Subsidiaries (collectively, the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 The Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and will require additional capital to fund its current operating plan. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The fair value accounting standards define fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is determined based upon assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Fair value measurements are rated on a three-tier hierarchy as follows: 

Level 1 inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; 

Level 2 inputs: Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level 3 inputs: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

 ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
 
 There are no reportable events under this Item for the year ended June 30, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2023, due to the material weaknesses resulting from the Board of Directors not currently having any members who qualify as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management has also evaluated our internal control over financial reporting, and there have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date of our last evaluation. 
 
 The Company is not required by current SEC rules to include, and does not include, an auditor's attestation report. The Company's registered public accounting firm has not attested to Management's reports on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 ITEM 9B. Other Information

 We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation.

 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.

Board Composition 
 
 Our By-Laws provide that the Board of Directors which shall constitute the whole board shall not be less than one (1) nor more than seven (7) or such other maximum number of directors as permitted by the Nevada General Corporation Law. The maximum or minimum number of directors cannot be changed, nor can a fixed number be substituted for the maximum and minimum numbers, except by a duly adopted amendment to the articles of incorporation or by an amendment to this bylaw. 
 
 No Committees of the Board of Directors; No Financial Expert 
 
 We do not presently have a separately constituted audit committee, compensation committee, nominating committee, executive committee or any other committees of our Board of Directors. Nor do we have an audit committee or financial expert. Management has decided not to establish an audit committee at present because our limited resources and limited operating activities do not warrant the formation of an audit committee or the expense of doing so. As such, our entire Board of Directors acts as our audit committee. We do not have a financial expert serving on the Board of Directors or employed as an officer based on management s belief that the cost of obtaining the services of a person who meets the criteria for a financial expert under Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Item 407(d) of Regulation S-K is beyond our limited financial resources and the financial skills of such an expert are simply not required or necessary for us to maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting in light of the limited scope and simplicity of accounting issues raised in our financial statements at this stage of our development. 
 
 Auditors 
 
 Our principal registered independent auditor is RBSM LLP 
 
 Code of Ethics 
 
 The Company does not have a written code of ethics that applies to the Company s officers. 
 
 Potential Conflicts of Interest 
 
 Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions. We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executives or directors. 
 
 Director Independence 
 
 Our board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each director and considered whether any director has a material relationship with us that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities. As a result of this review, our board of directors determined that Don Savant, Tracy Gray and Sid Ganis are independent directors. 
 
 Involvement in Legal Proceedings 
 
 None of our officers or directors has filed a personal bankruptcy petition, had a bankruptcy petition filed against any business of which they were a general partner or officer at the time of bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time, or has been convicted of or been the subject of any criminal proceedings or the subject of any order, judgment or decree involving the violation of any state or federal securities laws within the past ten (10) years. 
 17

Executive officers, directors and greater than 10 shareholders are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. 
 
 ITEM 11. Executive Compensation 
 
 Summary Compensation

 Outstanding Equity Awards 
 
 Our directors and officers do not have unexercised options, stock that has not vested, or equity incentive plan awards. 
 
 Compensation of Directors

 Employment Contracts, Termination of Employment, Change-in-Control Arrangements 
 
 There are no formal employment contracts, or other contracts with our officers or directors. There are no compensation plans or arrangements, including payments to be made by us, with respect to our officers, directors or consultants that would result from the resignation, retirement or any other termination of such directors, officers or consultants from us. There are no arrangements for directors, officers, employees or consultants that would result from a change-in-control. 
 
 ITEM 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters 
 
 Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners 
 
 The following table lists, as of October 2, 2023, the number of shares of common stock of our Company that are beneficially owned by (i) each person or entity known to our Company to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of the outstanding common stock; (ii) each officer and director of our Company; and (iii) all officers and directors as a group.
