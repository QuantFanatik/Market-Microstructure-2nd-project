PART I 
 (All dollar amounts are in thousands, except per share and per square foot data). 

ITEM I. BUSINESS 
 GENERAL 
 
 Village Super Market, Inc. (the Company or Village was founded in 1937. Village operates a chain of 34 supermarkets in New Jersey (26), New York (6), Maryland (1) and Pennsylvania (1) under the ShopRite and Fairway banners and four Gourmet Garage specialty markets in New York City. Village is the second largest member of Wakefern Food Corporation Wakefern ), the nation s largest retailer-owned food cooperative and owner of the ShopRite, Fairway and Gourmet Garage names. This ownership interest in Wakefern provides Village with many of the economies of scale in purchasing, distribution, advanced retail technology, marketing and advertising associated with chains of greater size and geographic coverage. 
 The supermarket industry is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins. The Company competes directly with multiple retail formats, both in-store and online, including national, regional and local supermarket chains as well as warehouse clubs, supercenters, drug stores, discount general merchandise stores, fast food chains, restaurants, dollar stores and convenience stores. The Company competes by providing a superior customer service experience, competitive pricing and a broad range of consistently available quality products. The ShopRite Price Plus and Fairway Insider customer loyalty programs enable Village to offer continuity programs, focus on target marketing initiatives and to offer discounts and attach digital coupons directly to a customer's loyalty card. 
 Online grocery ordering for in-store pick up or home delivery is available in all of our ShopRite stores through shoprite.com, the ShopRite app or through third party service providers. Additionally, the ShopRite Order Express app enables customers to pre-order deli, catering, specialty occasion cakes and other items. Online ordering for home delivery is available in all Fairway stores through fairwaymarket.com, the Fairway app or through third party service providers. Online ordering for home delivery is available in all Gourmet Garage stores through gourmetgarage.com, the Gourmet Garage app or through third party service providers. 
 To promote production efficiency, product quality and consistency, the Company operates a centralized commissary supplying certain products in deli, bakery, prepared foods and other perishable product categories to all stores. The Company also owns and operates an automated micro-fulfillment center to facilitate online order fulfillment for the south NJ stores. 
 During fiscal 2023, sales per store were 57,017 and sales per average square foot of selling space were 1,460. 

Below is a summary of the range of store sizes at July 29, 2023: 
 Total Square Feet Number of Stores Greater than 60,000 16 50,001 to 60,000 9 40,001 to 50,000 5 20,000 to 40,000 4 Less than 20,000 4 Total 38 
 These larger store sizes enable the Company to offer a wide variety of national branded and locally sourced food products, including grocery, meat, produce, dairy, deli, seafood, prepared foods, bakery and frozen foods as well as non-food product offerings, including health and beauty care, general merchandise, liquor and 21 in-store pharmacies. Most product departments include high-quality, competitively priced own-brand offerings under the Wholesome Pantry, Bowl Basket, Paperbird and Fairway brands. Our Fairway Markets offer a one-stop destination shopping experience with an emphasis on fresh, unique, and high quality offerings paired with an expansive variety of natural, organic, specialty and gourmet products. Our Gourmet Garage specialty markets offer organic produce, signature soups and prepared foods, high-quality meat and seafood, charcuterie and gourmet cheeses, artisan baked bread and pastries, chef-prepared meals to go and pantry staples. 
 
 The following table shows the percentage of the Company's sales allocated to various product categories during each of the periods indicated: 
 
 Product Categories 2023 2022 Groceries 34.9 34.4 Dairy and Frozen 17.3 17.1 Produce 13.2 13.3 Meats 9.3 9.7 Non-Foods 6.8 7.2 Deli and Prepared Food 8.3 8.1 Pharmacy 3.3 3.3 Seafood 2.9 3.0 Bakery 2.8 2.7 Liquor 0.9 0.9 Other 0.3 0.3 100 100 
 
 A variety of factors affect the profitability of each of the Company's stores, including competition, size, access and parking, lease terms, management supervision, and the strength of the applicable banner in the local community. The Company gives ongoing attention to the d cor and format of its stores and tailors each store's product mix to the preferences of the local community. Village continually evaluates individual stores to determine if they should be closed, remodeled or replaced. 
 On August 14, 2022, we converted the Pelham, NY store from the Fairway banner to the ShopRite banner and a major remodel of the store was completed in late October 2022. 
 On April 29, 2022, Village opened a 14,600 sq. ft. Gourmet Garage in the West Village in Manhattan, NYC. 
 ACQUISITIONS, DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION 
 
 The Company has an ongoing program to upgrade and expand its supermarket chain. This program has included store remodels as well as the opening or acquisition of additional stores. When remodeling, Village has sought, whenever possible, to increase the amount of selling space in its stores. 
 
 We have budgeted 85,000 for capital expenditures in fiscal 2024. Planned expenditures include costs for construction of the Old Bridge replacement store scheduled to open in fiscal 2024 and two other replacement stores scheduled to open in fiscal 2025, potential real estate purchases, several smaller store remodels and merchandising initiatives and various technology, 
 2 

equipment and facility upgrades. The Company s primary sources of liquidity in fiscal 2024 are expected to be cash and cash equivalents on hand at July 29, 2023 and operating cash flow generated in fiscal 2024. 
 
 On April 28, 2022, the Company entered into a partnership agreement for a 30 interest in the development of a retail center in Old Bridge, New Jersey, which includes Village's Old Bridge replacement store with an operating lease obligation of 4,127 as of July 29, 2023. Village will fund its share of project costs estimated to be 15,000 to 20,000 over the two to three year life of the project. As of July 29, 2023, Village has invested 10,875 into the real estate partnership, which is accounted for as an equity method investment included in Investments in Real Estate Partnerships on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 Additional store remodels and sites for new stores are in various stages of development. Village will also consider additional acquisitions should appropriate opportunities arise. 
 
 Fiscal 2023 
 
 Fiscal 2023 capital expenditures primarily include costs associated with the remodel and conversion of the Pelham, NY Fairway to the ShopRite banner, the new Gourmet Garage store in the West Village of New York City, the purchase of the Vineland store shopping center, costs for construction of the Old Bridge replacement store, installation of electronic shelf labels, continued expansion of self-checkout, and various technology, equipment and facility upgrades. 
 
 Fiscal 2022 
 
 Fiscal 2022 capital expenditures primarily include costs associated with the purchase of the Galloway store shopping center, the purchase of land in central New Jersey for a potential replacement store and other development, the new Gourmet Garage store in the West Village of New York City, continued expansion of self-checkout, and various merchandising, technology, equipment and facility upgrades. 
 
 WAKEFERN FOOD CORPORATION 
 
 The Company is the second largest member of Wakefern and owns 12.7 of Wakefern s outstanding stock as of July 29, 2023. Wakefern, which was organized in 1946, is the nation s largest retailer-owned food cooperative. Wakefern and its 45 shareholder members operate 366 supermarkets and other retail formats, including 88 stores operated by Wakefern. Only Wakefern and its members are entitled to use the ShopRite, Fairway and Gourmet Garage names and trademarks, and to participate in related advertising and promotional programs. 
 
 The principal benefits to the Company from its relationship with Wakefern are the use of the ShopRite, Fairway and Gourmet Garage names and trademarks, volume purchasing, store and own branded products, distribution and warehousing economies of scale, advertising and promotional programs and the development of advanced retail technology. The Company believes that the ShopRite and Fairway names are widely recognized by its customers and is a factor in their decisions about where to shop. Store and own branded products accounted for approximately 14 of ShopRite sales in fiscal 2023. 
 
 Wakefern distributes as a "patronage dividend" to each of its stockholders a share of substantially all of its earnings in proportion to the dollar volume of purchases by the stockholder from Wakefern during each fiscal year. 
 
 While Wakefern has a substantial professional staff, it operates as a member owned cooperative. Executives of most members make contributions of time to the business of Wakefern. Executives of the Company spend a significant amount of their time working on various Wakefern committees, which oversee and direct Wakefern purchasing, merchandising and other programs. In addition, Nicholas Sumas, the Company s Co-President, is a member of the Wakefern Board of Directors. 
 
 Most of the Company's advertising is developed and placed by Wakefern's professional advertising staff. Wakefern is responsible for all broadcast television, radio, print and digital advertisements. Wakefern bills its members using various formulas which allocate advertising costs in accordance with the estimated proportional benefits to each member from such advertising. The Company also places Wakefern developed materials with local newspapers. In addition, Wakefern and its affiliates provide the Company with other services including liability and property insurance, supplies, certain equipment purchasing, coupon processing, certain financial accounting applications, retail technology support, including shoprite.com, gourmetgarage.com, fairwaymarket.com, branded apps and other store services. 
 
 Wakefern operates warehouses and distribution facilities in Elizabeth, Keasbey, Dayton, Newark and Jamesburg, New Jersey and Gouldsboro, Breinigsville and Hatfield, Pennsylvania. The Company and all other members of Wakefern are parties to the Wakefern Stockholders' Agreement which provides for certain commitments by, and restrictions on, all shareholders of 
 3 

Wakefern. This agreement extends until ten years from the date that stockholders representing 75 of Wakefern sales notify Wakefern that those stockholders request the Wakefern Stockholders' Agreement be terminated. Each member is obligated to purchase from Wakefern a minimum of 85 of its requirements for products offered by Wakefern. If this purchase obligation is not met, the member is required to pay Wakefern's profit contribution shortfall attributable to this failure. The Company fulfilled this obligation in fiscal 2023 and 2022. This agreement also requires that in the event of unapproved changes in control of the Company or a sale of the Company or of individual Company stores, except to a qualified successor, the Company in such cases must pay Wakefern an amount equal to the annual profit contribution shortfall attributable to the sale of a store or change in control. No payments are required if the volume lost by a shareholder as a result of the sale of a store is replaced by such shareholder by increased volume in existing or new stores. A "qualified successor" must be, or agree to become, a member of Wakefern, and may not own or operate any supermarkets, other than ShopRite, PriceRite, The Fresh Grocer, Fairway, Gourmet Garage or Dearborn Market supermarkets, in the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine or the District of Columbia, or own or operate more than 25 non-ShopRite supermarkets in any other locations in the United States. 
 
 Wakefern, under circumstances specified in its bylaws, may refuse to sell merchandise to, and may repurchase the Wakefern stock of, any member. Such circumstances include a member's bankruptcy filing, certain unapproved transfers by a member of its supermarket business or its capital stock in Wakefern, unapproved acquisition by a member of certain supermarket or grocery wholesale supply businesses, the material breach by a member of any provision of the bylaws of Wakefern or any agreement with Wakefern, or a failure to fulfill financial obligations to Wakefern. 
 
 Any material change in Wakefern's method of operation or a termination or material modification of the Company's relationship with Wakefern following termination of the above agreements, or otherwise, might have an adverse impact on the conduct of the Company's business and could involve additional expense for the Company. The failure of any Wakefern member to fulfill its obligations under these agreements or a member's insolvency or withdrawal from Wakefern could result in increased costs to remaining members. 
 
 Wakefern does not prescribe geographical franchise areas to its members. The specific locations at which the Company, other members of Wakefern, or Wakefern itself, may open new units under the ShopRite, PriceRite, The Fresh Grocer, Fairway, Gourmet Garage or Dearborn Market names are, however, subject to the approval of Wakefern's Site Development Committee. This committee is composed of persons who are not employees or members of Wakefern. Committee decisions to deny a site application may be appealed to the Wakefern Board of Directors. Wakefern assists its members in their site selection by providing appropriate demographic data, volume projections and estimates of the impact of the proposed store on existing member supermarkets in the area. 
 
 Each of Wakefern's members is required to make capital contributions to Wakefern based on the number of stores operated by that member and the purchases from Wakefern generated by those stores. As additional stores are opened or acquired by a member, additional capital must be contributed by it to Wakefern. The Company s investment in Wakefern and affiliates was 33,107 at July 29, 2023. The total amount of debt outstanding from all capital pledges to Wakefern is 2,423 at July 29, 2023. The maximum per store investment is currently 975. 
 
 As required by the Wakefern bylaws, the Company s investment in Wakefern is pledged to Wakefern to secure the Company s obligations to Wakefern. In addition, four members of the Sumas family have guaranteed the Company s obligations to Wakefern. These personal guarantees are required of any 5 shareholder of the Company who is active in the operation of the Company. Wakefern does not own any securities of the Company or its subsidiaries. The Company s investment in Wakefern entitles the Company to enough votes to elect one member to the Wakefern Board of Directors due to cumulative voting rights. 
 
 LABOR 
 
 As of July 29, 2023, the Company employed approximately 7,000 persons with approximately 69 working part-time. Approximately 92 of the Company s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Contracts with the Company s seven unions have expiration dates between June 2024 and October 2027. Approximately 18 of our associates are represented by unions whose contracts have expired or will expire within one year. Many of the Company s competitors are similarly unionized. 
 
 SEASONALITY 
 
 The majority of our revenues are generally not seasonal in nature. However, revenues tend to be higher during the major holidays throughout the year. 
 
 4 

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 
 
 The Company s business requires various licenses and the registration of facilities with state and federal health and drug regulatory agencies. These licenses and registration requirements obligate the Company to observe certain rules and regulations, and a violation of these rules and regulations could result in a suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations and fines or penalties. In addition, most licenses require periodic renewals. The Company has not experienced material difficulties with respect to obtaining or retaining licenses and registrations. 
 
 COMPETITION 
 
 The supermarket business is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins. Village competes directly with multiple retail formats both in-store and online, including national, regional and local supermarket chains as well as warehouse clubs, supercenters, drug stores, discount general merchandise stores, fast food chains, restaurants, dollar stores and convenience stores. Some of the Company's principal competitors include Acme, Aldi, Amazon/Whole Foods, BJs, Costco, Foodtown, Giant, Kings, Lidl, Safeway, Stop Shop, Target, Trader Joe's, Wal-Mart, Wegmans and Weis. Competition with these outlets is based on price, store location, convenience, promotion, product assortment, quality and service. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources, lower merchandise acquisition costs and lower operating expenses than we do. 
 
 AVAILABLE INFORMATION 
 
 As a member of the Wakefern cooperative, Village relies upon our customer focused websites, shoprite.com, gourmetgarage.com and fairwaymarket.com, for interaction with customers and prospective employees. These websites are maintained by Wakefern for the benefit of all supermarkets under the Wakefern banners, and therefore does not contain any financial information related to the Company. 
 
 The Company will provide paper copies of the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and press releases free of charge upon request to any shareholder. In addition, electronic copies of these filings can be obtained at sec.gov.

 As of July 29, 2023, Village owns the sites of eight of its supermarkets (containing 539,000 square feet of total space) and the micro-fulfillment center in southern New Jersey. The remaining 30 stores (containing 1,501,000 square feet of total space), the central commissary and the corporate headquarters are leased, with initial lease terms generally ranging from 20 to 30 years, usually with renewal options. The stores are freestanding or are located in shopping centers or city storefronts. Most of the Company s leases contain renewal options at increased rents of five years each at the Company s sole discretion. These options enable Village to retain the use of facilities in desirable operating areas. Each renewal option is evaluated when recognizing the lease right-of-use assets and liabilities, and the Company utilizes the lease term for which it is reasonably certain to use the underlying asset. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company is obligated under all leases to pay for real estate taxes, utilities and liability insurance, and under certain leases to pay additional amounts based on maintenance and a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts. The Company accounts for rent holidays, escalating rent provisions, and construction allowances on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Company owns all trade fixtures and equipment in its stores and several other properties including a shopping center and parcels of vacant land, which are available as locations for possible future stores or other development.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 (Dollars in thousands, except per share and per square foot data). 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 Village Super Market, Inc. (the Company or Village operates a chain of 34 supermarkets in New Jersey (26), New York (6), Maryland (1) and Pennsylvania (1) under the ShopRite and Fairway banners and four Gourmet Garage specialty markets in New York City. Village is the second largest member of Wakefern Food Corporation Wakefern ), the nation s largest retailer-owned food cooperative and owner of the ShopRite, Fairway and Gourmet Garage names. This ownership interest in Wakefern provides Village with many of the economies of scale in purchasing, distribution, advanced retail technology, marketing and advertising associated with larger chains. 
 The supermarket industry is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins. The Company competes directly with multiple retail formats, both in-store and online, including national, regional and local supermarket chains as well as warehouse clubs, supercenters, drug stores, discount general merchandise stores, fast food chains, restaurants, dollar stores and convenience stores. The Company competes by providing a superior customer service experience, competitive pricing and a broad range of consistently available quality products. The ShopRite Price Plus and Fairway Insider customer loyalty programs enable Village to offer continuity programs, focus on target marketing initiatives and to offer discounts and attach digital coupons directly to a customer's loyalty card. 
 Online grocery ordering for in-store pick up or home delivery is available in all of our ShopRite stores through shoprite.com, the ShopRite app or through third party service providers. Additionally, the ShopRite Order Express app enables customers to pre-order deli, catering, specialty occasion cakes and other items. Online ordering for home delivery is available in all Fairway stores through fairwaymarket.com, the Fairway app or through third party service providers. Online ordering for home delivery 
 10 

is available in all Gourmet Garage stores through gourmetgarage.com, the Gourmet Garage app or through third party service providers. 
 To promote production efficiency, product quality and consistency, the Company operates a centralized commissary supplying certain products in deli, bakery, prepared foods and other perishable product categories to all stores. The Company also owns and operates an automated micro-fulfillment center to facilitate online order fulfillment for the south New Jersey stores. 
 The Company s stores, eight of which are owned, average 54,000 total square feet. These larger store sizes enable the Company to offer a wide variety of national branded and locally sourced food products, including grocery, meat, produce, dairy, deli, seafood, prepared foods, bakery and frozen foods as well as non-food product offerings, including health and beauty care, general merchandise, liquor and 21 in-store pharmacies. Most product departments include high-quality, competitively priced own-brand offerings under the Wholesome Pantry, Bowl Basket, Paperbird and Fairway brands. Our Fairway Markets offer a one-stop destination shopping experience with an emphasis on fresh, unique, and high quality offerings paired with an expansive variety of natural, organic, specialty and gourmet products. Our Gourmet Garage specialty markets offer organic produce, signature soups and prepared foods, high-quality meat and seafood, charcuterie and gourmet cheeses, artisan baked bread and pastries, chef-prepared meals to go and pantry staples. 
 The Company has an ongoing program to upgrade and expand its supermarket chain. This program has included store remodels as well as the opening or acquisition of additional stores. When remodeling, Village has sought, whenever possible, to increase the amount of selling space in its stores. On August 14, 2022, we converted the Pelham, NY store from the Fairway banner to the ShopRite banner and a major remodel of the store was completed in late October 2022. On April 29, 2022, Village opened a 14,600 sq. ft. Gourmet Garage in the West Village in Manhattan, NYC. 
 We consider a variety of indicators to evaluate our performance, such as same store sales; percentage of total sales by department (mix); shrink; departmental gross profit percentage; sales per labor hour; units per labor hour; and hourly labor rates. 
 
 The Company utilizes a 52 - 53 week fiscal year, ending on the last Saturday in the month of July. Both fiscal 2023 and 2022 contain 52 weeks. 
 
 NON-GAAP MEASURES 
 The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related notes, are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). We provide non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted net income and Adjusted operating and administrative expenses as management believes these supplemental measures are useful to investors and analysts. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP, nor as an alternative to net income, operating and administrative expense or any other GAAP measure of performance. Adjusted net income and Adjusted operating and administrative expense are useful to investors because they provide supplemental measures that exclude the financial impact of certain items that affect period-to-period comparability. Management and the Board of Directors use these measures as they provide greater transparency in assessing ongoing operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Other companies may have different definitions of Non-GAAP Measures and provide for different adjustments, and comparability to the Company's results of operations may be impacted by such differences. The Company's presentation of Non-GAAP Measures should not be construed as an implication that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

The following tables reconciles Net income to Adjusted net income and Operating and administrative expenses to Adjusted operating and administrative expenses: 
 July 29, 2023 July 30, 2022 Net Income 49,716 26,830 Adjustments to Operating Expenses: Litigation settlement gain (1) (1,200) Loss (gain) on non-operating investments (2) 400 (494) Pension termination and settlement charges (3) 12,341 Adjustments to Income Taxes: Tax impact of adjustments to operating expenses 248 (3,633) Adjusted net income 49,164 35,044 Operating and administrative expenses 516,902 507,597 Adjustments to operating and administrative expenses 800 (11,847) Adjusted operating and administrative expenses 517,702 495,750 Adjusted operating and administrative expenses as a of sales 23.89 24.05 
 
 (1) Fiscal 2023 litigation settlement gains are related to claims associated with the Fairway acquisition and liabilities associated thereto. 
 
 (2) Fiscal 2023 and 2022 include a 400 loss and a 494 gain, respectively, related to non-operating equity investments. 
 
 (3) Fiscal 2022 pension settlement charges related primarily to the termination of the Village Super Market, Inc. Employees Retirement Plan. The Company contributed cash of 1,440 to fully fund the plan and the remaining 10,901 represents non-cash charges for unrecognized losses within accumulated other comprehensive loss as of the termination date.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following table sets forth the components of the consolidated statements of operations of the Company as a percentage of sales: 
 
 July 29, 2023 July 30, 2022 Sales 100.00 100.00 Cost of sales 71.55 71.88 Gross profit 28.45 28.12 Operating and administrative expense 23.86 24.63 Depreciation and amortization 1.58 1.61 Operating income 3.01 1.88 Interest expense (0.19) (0.19) Interest income 0.53 0.20 Income before income taxes 3.35 1.89 Income taxes 1.06 0.59 Net income 2.29 1.30 
 
 SALES 
 
 Sales were 2,166,654 in fiscal 2023, an increase of 105,570, or 5.1 from fiscal 2022. Sales increased due primarily to an increase in same store sales of 3.5 , the opening of a Gourmet Garage in the West Village in Manhattan, NY on April 29, 2022 and increased sales due to the remodel and conversion of the Pelham, NY Fairway to the ShopRite banner on August 15, 2022. Same store sales increased due primarily to retail price inflation. 
 New stores, replacement stores and stores with banner changes are included in same store sales in the quarter after the store has been in operation for four full quarters. Store renovations and expansions are included in same store sales immediately. 
 
 GROSS PROFIT 
 Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 28.45 in fiscal 2023 compared to 28.12 in fiscal 2022 due primarily to increased departmental gross margin percentages (.23 ), increased patronage dividends and rebates received from Wakefern (.08 ), lower LIFO charges (.04 ), a favorable change in product mix (.02 and lower promotional spending (.03 partially offset by increased warehouse assessment charges from Wakefern (.07 ). Department gross margins increased due primarily to pricing initiatives and improvements in commissary operations partially offset by higher inventory shrink. 
 
 OPERATING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 
 
 Operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 23.86 in fiscal 2023 compared to 24.63 in fiscal 2022. Adjusted operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 23.89 in fiscal 2023 compared to 24.05 in fiscal 2022 due primarily to lower labor costs (.19 and decreased supply spending (.12 partially offset by increased self-insured claim costs (.09 and higher facility repair and maintenance costs (.05 ). Labor costs and fringe benefits decreased due primarily to sales leverage and ongoing productivity initiatives partially offset by minimum wage and market-driven pay rate increases. 
 DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense was 34,002 and 33,122 in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense increased due primarily to capital expenditures. 
 
 INTEREST EXPENSE 
 
 Interest expense was 4,220 and 3,907 in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Interest expense increased due primarily to higher average outstanding debt balances. 

13 

INTEREST INCOME 
 
 Interest income was 11,399 and 4,023 in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Interest income increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due primarily to higher interest rates and larger amounts invested in variable rate notes receivable from Wakefern and demand deposits invested at Wakefern. 
 
 INCOME TAXES 
 
 The Company s effective income tax rate was 31.6 and 31.3 in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 NET INCOME 
 
 Net income was 49,716 in fiscal 2023 compared to 26,830 in fiscal 2022. Adjusted net income was 49,164 in fiscal 2023 compared to 35,044 in fiscal 2022. Adjusted net income increased 40 compared to the prior year due primarily to the 3.5 increase in same store sales, improvements in gross profit and operating and administrative expense margins and increased interest income. 
 
 14 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results of operations. These policies require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 IMPAIRMENT 
 
 The Company reviews the carrying values of its long-lived assets, such as property, equipment and fixtures and operating lease assets on an individual store basis for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered by the Company that could result in an impairment triggering event include a current period operating or cash flow loss, underperformance of a store relative to historical or expected operating results, and significant negative industry or economic trends. If an impairment triggering event is identified, the Company analyzes the undiscounted estimated future net cash flows from asset groups at the store level to determine if the carrying value of such assets are recoverable from their respective cash flows. If impairment is indicated, it is measured by comparing the fair value of the long-lived asset groups to their carrying value. 
 
 Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested at the end of each fiscal year, or more frequently if circumstances dictate, for impairment. The Company utilizes valuation techniques, such as earnings multiples, in addition to the Company s market capitalization, to assess goodwill for impairment. Calculating the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of estimates. Management believes the fair value of Village s one reporting unit exceeds its carrying value at July 29, 2023. Should the Company s carrying value of its one reporting unit exceed its fair value, the amount of any resulting goodwill impairment may be material to the Company s financial position and results of operations. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets are estimated based on the discounted cash flow model using the relief from royalty method. 
 
 PATRONAGE DIVIDENDS 
 
 As a stockholder of Wakefern, Village earns a share of Wakefern s earnings, which are distributed as a patronage dividend. This dividend is based on a distribution of substantially all of Wakefern s operating profits for its fiscal year (which ends on or about September 30) in proportion to the dollar volume of purchases by each member from Wakefern during that fiscal year. Patronage dividends are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales as merchandise is sold. Village accrues estimated patronage dividends due from Wakefern quarterly based on an estimate of the annual Wakefern patronage dividend and an estimate of Village s share of this annual dividend based on Village s estimated proportional share of the dollar volume of business transacted with Wakefern that year. The patronage dividend receivable based on these estimates was 12,466 and 12,239 at July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively. 
 
 PENSION PLANS 
 
 The determination of the Company s obligation and expense for Company-sponsored pension plans is dependent, in part, on Village s selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions are described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation costs. Actual results that differ from the Company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense in future periods. While management believes that its assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the Company s assumptions may materially affect cash flows, pension obligations and future expense. 
 
 The objective of the discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the Company s pension obligations could be effectively settled based on the expected timing and amounts of benefits payable to participants under the plans. Our methodology for selecting the discount rate as of July 29, 2023 was to match the plans' cash flows to that of a yield curve on high-quality fixed-income investments. Based on this method, we utilized a weighted-average discount rate of 4.85 at July 29, 2023 compared to 3.77 at July 30, 2022. Changes in the discount rate and updated assumptions on mortality tables and improvement scales resulted in a net decrease in the projected benefit obligation by approximately 771 at July 29, 2023. Village evaluated the expected increase in compensation costs of 4.50 and concluded no changes in this assumption was necessary in estimating pension plan obligations and expense. The Company utilizes a liability-driven investment ("LDI") 
 15 

strategy. A LDI strategy focuses on maintaining a close to fully-funded status over the long-term with minimal funded status risk. This is achieved by investing more of the plan assets in fixed income instruments to more closely match the duration of the plan liability. The investment allocation to fixed income instruments will increase as each plans' funded status increases. Based on the Company s LDI strategy, the Company assumed a weighted-average assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.75 in fiscal 2023. 
 
 Sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of the Company s pension plans is as follows: 
 Percentage point change Projected benefit obligation decrease (increase) Expense decrease (increase) Discount rate + / - 1.0 638 (684) 34 (72) Expected return on assets + / - 1.0 21 (21) 
 
 In April 2022, the Company terminated the Village Super Market, Inc. Employees Retirement Plan. Prior to termination, the Company made a 1,485 contribution to fully fund the plan. Plan assets were liquidated to fund lump sum distributions to participants of 37,289 and purchase annuity contracts totaling 14,930 with an insurance company for all participants who did not elect a lump sum distribution. No benefit obligation or plan assets related to the Village Super Market, Inc. Employees Retirement Plan remain as of July 29, 2023. In fiscal 2022, the Company recognized a 12,296 pre-tax settlement charge as a result of the termination, including a 10,856 non-cash charge for unrecognized losses within accumulated other comprehensive loss as of the termination date. Village made no contributions to the remaining plans in fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. Contributions to the remaining plans are expected to be immaterial in fiscal 2024. 
 
 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 
 For the disclosure related to recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 LIQUIDITY and CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 CASH FLOWS 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 104,513 in fiscal 2023 compared to 79,625 in fiscal 2022. The change in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to changes in working capital and higher net income adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred taxes, pension settlement charges, the provision to value inventories at LIFO, impairment charges and the gain on sale of property, equipment and fixtures. Working capital changes, including other assets and other liabilities, increased net cash provided by operating activities by 15,021 in fiscal 2023 compared to 7,081 in fiscal 2022. 
 
 During fiscal 2023, Village used cash to fund capital expenditures of 46,400, dividends of 13,193, principal payments of long-term debt of 10,446, treasury stock purchases of 3,739, an investment in a real estate partnership for the development of a retail center in Old Bridge, New Jersey of 5,865 and additional net investments of 36,425 in notes receivable from Wakefern. Capital expenditures primarily include costs associated with the remodel and conversion of the Pelham, NY Fairway to the ShopRite banner, the new Gourmet Garage store in the West Village of New York City, the purchase of the Vineland store shopping center, costs for construction of the Old Bridge replacement store, installation of electronic shelf labels, continued expansion of self-checkout, and various technology, equipment and facility upgrades. 
 
 During fiscal 2022, Village used cash to fund capital expenditures of 43,270, dividends of 13,041, principal payments of long-term debt of 8,299 and additional investments of 2,489 in notes receivable from Wakefern. Capital expenditures primarily include costs associated with the purchase of the Galloway store shopping center, the purchase of land in central New Jersey for a potential replacement store and other development, the new Gourmet Garage store in the West Village of New York City, continued expansion of self-checkout, and various merchandising, technology, equipment and facility upgrades. 
 
 LIQUIDITY and DEBT 
 
 Working capital was 67,714 and 79,796 at July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively. Working capital ratios at the same dates were 1.38 and 1.50 to one, respectively. The decrease in working capital in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 is due 
 16 

primarily to an additional 36,425 investment in long-term notes receivable from Wakefern. The Company s working capital needs are reduced, since inventories are generally sold by the time payments to Wakefern and other suppliers are due. 
 
 We have budgeted 85,000 for capital expenditures in fiscal 2024. Planned expenditures include costs for construction of the Old Bridge replacement store scheduled to open in fiscal 2024 and two other replacement stores scheduled to open in fiscal 2025, potential real estate purchases, several smaller store remodels and merchandising initiatives and various technology, equipment and facility upgrades. The Company s primary sources of liquidity in fiscal 2024 are expected to be cash and cash equivalents on hand at July 29, 2023 and operating cash flow generated in fiscal 2024. 
 
 On April 28, 2022 the Company entered into a partnership agreement for a 30 interest in the development of a retail center in Old Bridge, New Jersey, which includes a Village replacement store with an operating lease obligation of 4,127 as of July 29, 2023. Village will fund its share of project costs estimated to be 15,000 to 20,000 over the two to three year life of the project. As of July 29, 2023, Village has invested 10,875 into the real estate partnership, which is accounted for as an equity method investment included in Investments in Real Estate Partnerships on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 On August 15, 2022, notes receivable due from Wakefern of 28,850 that earned interest at the prime rate plus 1.25 matured. The Company invested all of the proceeds received in variable rate notes receivable from Wakefern that earn interest at the prime rate plus .50 and mature on August 15, 2027. On September 28, 2022, the Company invested an additional 30,000 in variable rate notes receivable from Wakefern that earn interest at the prime rate plus .50 and mature on September 28, 2027. 
 
 At July 29, 2023, the Company held variable rate notes receivable due from Wakefern of 31,483 that earn interest at the prime rate plus .75 and mature on February 15, 2024, 30,865 that earn interest at the prime rate plus .50 and mature on August 15, 2027 and 31,861 that earn interest at the prime rate plus .50 and mature on September 28, 2027. Wakefern has the right to prepay these notes at any time. Under certain conditions, the Company can require Wakefern to prepay the notes, although interest earned since inception would be reduced as if it was earned based on overnight money market rates as paid by Wakefern on demand deposits. 
 
 At July 29, 2023, Village had demand deposits invested at Wakefern in the amount of 122,028. These deposits earn overnight money market rates. 
 
 Credit Facility 
 
 The Company has a credit facility (the Credit Facility with Wells Fargo National Bank, National Association Wells Fargo ). The principal purpose of the Credit Facility is to finance general corporate and working capital requirements, Village s fiscal 2020 acquisition of certain Fairway assets and certain capital expenditures. Among other things, the Credit Facility provides for: 
 
 An unsecured revolving line of credit providing a maximum amount available for borrowing of 75,000. Indebtedness under this agreement bears interest at the applicable Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus 1.10 and expires on May 6, 2025. 
 
 An unsecured 25,500 term loan issued on May 12, 2020, repayable in equal monthly installments based on a seven-year amortization schedule through May 4, 2027 and bearing interest at the applicable SOFR plus 1.46 . An interest rate swap with notional amounts equal to the term loan fixes the base SOFR at .26 per annum through May 4, 2027, resulting in a fixed effective interest rate of 1.72 on the term loan. 
 
 A secured 50,000 term loan issued on September 1, 2020 repayable in equal monthly installments based on a fifteen-year amortization schedule through September 01, 2035 and bearing interest at the applicable SOFR plus 1.61 . An interest rate swap with notional amounts equal to the term loan fixes the base SOFR at .57 per annum through September 4, 2035, resulting in a fixed effective interest rate of 2.18 on the term loan. The term loan is secured by real properties of Village Super Market, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including the sites of three Village stores. 
 
 A secured 7,350 term loan issued on January 28, 2022 repayable in equal monthly installments based on a fifteen-year amortization schedule through January 28, 2037 and bearing interest at the applicable SOFR plus 1.50 . An interest rate swap with notional amounts equal to the term loan fixes the base SOFR at 1.41 per annum through January 28, 2037, resulting in a fixed effective interest rate of 2.91 on the term loan. The term loan is secured by the Galloway store shopping center acquired for 9,800 in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. 
 
 17 

On September 1, 2022, the Company amended the Credit Facility due to the execution of a seven year 10,000 unsecured term loan. The unsecured term loan is repayable in equal monthly installments based on a seven year amortization schedule through September 4, 2029 and bears interest at the applicable SOFR plus 1.35 . Village also executed an interest rate swap for a notional amount equal to the term loan amount that fixes the base SOFR at 2.95 , resulting in a fixed effective rate of 4.30 . This loan qualified for an interest rate subsidy program with Wakefern on financing related to certain capital expenditure projects. Net of the subsidy, the Company will pay interest at a fixed effective rate of 2.30 . 
 
 On January 27, 2023, the Company purchased the Vineland store shopping center for 9,500. As part of the purchase, the Company amended the Credit Facility due to the execution of a fifteen year 7,125 term loan secured by the Vineland store shopping center. The secured term loan is repayable in equal monthly installments based on a fifteen year amortization schedule through January 27, 2038 and bears interest at the applicable SOFR plus 1.75 . Village also executed an interest rate swap for a notional amount equal to the term loan amount that fixes the base SOFR at 3.59 , resulting in a fixed effective rate of 5.34 .

 OUTLOOK 
 
 This annual report contains certain forward-looking statements about Village s future performance. These statements are based on management s assumptions and beliefs in light of information currently available. Such statements relate to, for example: economic conditions; uninsured losses; expected pension plan contributions; projected capital expenditures; expected dividend payments; cash flow requirements; inflation expectations; public health conditions; and legal matters; and are indicated by words such as will, expect, should, intend, anticipates, believes and similar words or phrases. The Company cautions the reader that there is no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from the results expressed, suggested or implied by such forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect developments or information obtained after the date hereof. 
 
 We expect the increase in same store sales to range from 1.0 to 3.0 in fiscal 2024. 
 We have budgeted 85,000 for capital expenditures in fiscal 2024. Planned expenditures include costs for construction of the Old Bridge replacement store scheduled to open in fiscal 2024 and two other replacement stores scheduled to open in fiscal 2025, potential real estate purchases, several smaller store remodels and merchandising initiatives and various technology, equipment and facility upgrades. 
 The Board s current intention is to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2024 at the most recent rate of .25 per Class A and .1625 per Class B share. 
 We believe cash and cash equivalents on hand, operating cash flow and the Company's Credit Facility will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and debt payments for the foreseeable future. 
 We expect our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2024 to be in the range of 31.0 - 32.0 . 
 18 

Various uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements contained in this report. These include: 
 
 The supermarket business is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins. Results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by competitive pricing and promotional programs, industry consolidation and competitor store openings. Village competes directly with multiple retail formats both in-store and online, including national, regional and local supermarket chains as well as warehouse clubs, supercenters, drug stores, discount general merchandise stores, fast food chains, restaurants, dollar stores and convenience stores. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources, lower merchandise acquisition costs and lower operating expenses than we do. 
 The Company s stores are concentrated in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland. We are vulnerable to economic downturns in these states in addition to those that may affect the country as a whole. Economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rate fluctuations, movements in energy costs, social programs, minimum wage legislation, unemployment rates, disturbances due to social unrest and changing demographics may adversely affect our sales and profits. 
 Village purchases substantially all of its merchandise from Wakefern. In addition, Wakefern provides the Company with support services in numerous areas including advertising, liability and property insurance, supplies, certain equipment purchasing, coupon processing, certain financial accounting applications, retail technology support, and other store services. Further, Village receives patronage dividends and other product incentives from Wakefern and also has demand deposits and notes receivable due from Wakefern. 
 
 Any material change in Wakefern s method of operation or a termination or material modification of Village s relationship with Wakefern could have an adverse impact on the conduct of the Company s business and could involve additional expense for Village. The failure of any Wakefern member to fulfill its obligations to Wakefern or a member s insolvency or withdrawal from Wakefern could result in increased costs to the Company. Additionally, an adverse change in Wakefern s results of operations could have an adverse effect on Village s results of operations. 
 Approximately 92 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Any work stoppages could have an adverse impact on our financial results. If we are unable to control health care and pension costs provided for in the collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs. 
 The Company could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the food supply chain. The real or perceived sale of contaminated food products by us could result in a loss of consumer confidence and product liability claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations. 
 Certain of the multi-employer plans to which we contribute are underfunded. As a result, we expect that contributions to these plans may increase. Additionally, the benefit levels and related items will be issues in the negotiation of our collective bargaining agreements. Under current law, an employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan may incur a withdrawal liability to the plan, which represents the portion of the plan s underfunding that is allocable to the withdrawing employer under very complex actuarial and allocation rules. The failure of a withdrawing employer to fund these obligations can impact remaining employers. The amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multi-employer pension plans will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, government regulations, withdrawals by other participating employers and the actual return on assets held in the plans, among other factors. 
 The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation, automobile, general liability, property, director and officers liability, and certain employee health care benefits. Any projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, and insolvency of insurance carriers could all affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 Our long-lived assets, primarily store property, equipment and fixtures, are subject to periodic testing for impairment. Failure of our asset groups to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow could result in impairment charges on long-lived assets. 
 19 

Our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested at the end of each fiscal year, or more frequently if circumstances dictate, for impairment. Failure of acquired businesses to achieve their forecasted expectations could result in impairment charges to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
 Our effective tax rate may be impacted by the results of tax examinations and changes in tax laws. 
 Wakefern provides all members of the cooperative with information system support that enables us to effectively manage our business data, customer transactions, ordering, communications and other business processes. These information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer or telecommunications failures, computer viruses and related malicious software, catastrophic weather events, or human error. Any material interruption of our or Wakefern s information systems could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 Due to the nature of our business, personal information about our customers, vendors and associates is received and stored in these information systems. In addition, confidential information is transmitted through our online business at shoprite.com and through the ShopRite app. Unauthorized parties may attempt to access information stored in or to sabotage or disrupt these systems. Wakefern and the Company maintain substantial security measures to prevent and detect unauthorized access to such information, including utilizing third-party service providers for monitoring our networks, security reviews, and other functions. It is possible that computer hackers, cyber terrorists and others may be able to defeat the security measures in place at the Company, Wakefern or those of third-party service providers. 
 Any breach of these security measures and loss of confidential information, which could be undetected for a period of time, could damage our reputation with customers, vendors and associates, cause Wakefern and Village to incur significant costs to protect any customers, vendors and associates whose personal data was compromised, cause us to make changes to our information systems and could result in government enforcement actions and litigation against Wakefern and/or Village from outside parties. Any such breach could have a material adverse impact on our operations, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity if the related costs to Wakefern and Village are not covered or are in excess of carried insurance policies. In addition, a security breach could require Wakefern and Village to devote significant management resources to address problems created by the security breach and restore our reputation.

Leases 
 
 The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception, and recognizes a finance and operating lease liability and asset for all leases with terms of more than 12 months at the lease commencement date. Finance and operating lease liabilities represent the present value of minimum lease payments not yet paid. For purposes of measuring the present value of its fixed payment obligations for a given lease, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate implicit within its leases is generally not determinable. The Company's incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate it would pay to borrow on a secured basis, and incorporates the term and economic environment of the lease. Each renewal option is evaluated when recognizing the lease right-of-use assets and liabilities, and the Company utilizes the lease term for which it is reasonably certain to use the underlying asset. The Company is obligated under all leases to pay for real estate taxes, utilities and liability insurance, and under certain leases to pay additional amounts based on maintenance and a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts. The Company accounts for rent holidays, escalating rent provisions, and construction allowances related to operating leases in rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Finance lease payments are charged to interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense over the lease term. Additional information on leases is provided in Note 7.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 
 The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows are considered cash flow hedges. The Company records changes in the fair value of its interest rate swap contracts to Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, as the Company has elected to designate its swaps as cash flow hedges and apply hedge accounting when the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Additional information on derivative and hedging activities is provided in Note 5.

 as of July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022 are related to the Fairway and Gourmet Garage trade names. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its implied fair value. Village considers earnings multiples and other valuation techniques to measure fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level, in addition to the value of the Company s stock. The fair value of trade names are estimated based on the discounted cash flow model using the relief from royalty method.

 classes of common stock. Class A common stock is entitled to cash dividends as declared greater than those paid on Class B common stock. Shares of Class B common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis for Class A common stock at any time. 
 
 The Company utilizes the two-class method of computing and presenting net income per share. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that calculates basic and diluted net income per share for each class of common stock separately based on dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Under the two-class method, Class A common 
 30 

greater participation in undistributed earnings than Class B common stock, in accordance with the classes' respective dividend rights. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and therefore included in computing net income per share using the two-class method. 
 
 Diluted net income per share for Class A common stock is calculated utilizing the if-converted method, which assumes the conversion of all shares of Class B common stock to Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis, as this method is more dilutive than the two-class method. Diluted net income per share for Class B common stock does not assume conversion of Class B common stock to shares of Class A common stock.

 of the outstanding shares of Wakefern at July 29, 2023. The investment is stated at cost and is pledged as collateral for any obligations to Wakefern. In addition, all obligations to Wakefern are personally guaranteed by certain shareholders of Village. 
 
 The Company is obligated to purchase of its primary merchandise requirements from Wakefern until from the date that stockholders representing of Wakefern sales notify Wakefern that those stockholders request that the Wakefern Stockholder Agreement be terminated. If this purchase obligation is not met, Village is required to pay Wakefern s profit contribution shortfall attributable to this failure. Similar payments are due if Wakefern loses volume by reason of the sale of Company stores or a merger with another entity. Village fulfilled the above obligation in fiscal 2023 and 2022. The Company also has an investment of approximately in Insure-Rite, Ltd., a Wakefern affiliated company, which provides Village with liability and property insurance coverage. 
 
 Wakefern has increased from time to time the required investment in its common stock for each supermarket owned by a member, with the exact amount per store computed based on the amount of each store s purchases from Wakefern. At July 29, 2023, the Company s indebtedness to Wakefern for the outstanding amount of these stock subscriptions was . Installment payments are due as follows: 2024 - ; 2025 - ; 2026 - ; 2027 - ; 2028 - ; and thereafter.

in fiscal 2023. Village receives additional shares of common stock to the extent paid for at the end of each fiscal year (which ends on or about September 30) of Wakefern calculated at the then book value per share. The payments, together with any stock issued thereunder, at the option of Wakefern, may be null and void and all payments on this subscription shall become the property of Wakefern in the event the Company does not complete the payment of this subscription in a timely manner. 
 
 Village purchases substantially all of its merchandise from Wakefern. As a stockholder of Wakefern, Village earns a share of Wakefern s earnings, which are distributed as a patronage dividend. This dividend is based on a distribution of substantially all of Wakefern s operating profits for its fiscal year in proportion to the dollar volume of purchases by each member from Wakefern during that fiscal year.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 
 Village Super Market, Inc.: 
 
 Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Village Super Market, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of July 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 29, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 45 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Assessment of indicators of impairment of long-lived assets 
 
 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reviews its long-lived assets, such as property, equipment and fixtures and operating lease assets, for events or changes in circumstances that might indicate the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. The Company s judgment regarding the identification of impairment indicators is based, in part, on operational performance at the store level. Factors considered by the Company that could result in an impairment triggering event include a current period operating or cash flow loss, underperformance of a store relative to historical or expected operating results, and significant negative industry or economic trends. At July 29, 2023, the Company had property, equipment and fixtures, net and operating lease assets of 277,310 thousand and 274,100 thousand, respectively. 
 
 We identified the assessment of impairment triggering events related to long-lived assets as a critical audit matter. A high degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company s assessment of whether any of the following were indicators of impairment: (1) stores with current period operating or cash flow losses, (2) underperforming stores based on current period operating or cash flow results relative to their respective historical and expected results, and (3) negative industry or economic trends. 
 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company s long-lived asset impairment process. This included a control related to the Company s assessment of impairment triggering events. We assessed the Company s identification and evaluation of potential impairment triggering events by: 
 
 inspecting operating results and cash flows by store to identify stores with current period losses 
 
 comparing actual operating and cash flow results to historical results, expected results, industry and economic trends, and to the net book value of store assets for a selection of stores 
 
 reading board of directors meeting minutes and available industry information
