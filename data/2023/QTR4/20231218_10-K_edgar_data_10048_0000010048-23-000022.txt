PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
 Overview 
 
 Barnwell was incorporated in Delaware in 1956 and fiscal 2023 represented Barnwell s 67th year of operations. Barnwell operates in the following three principal business segments: 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Segment - Barnwell engages in oil and natural gas development, production, acquisitions and sales in Canada and in the U.S. states of Oklahoma and Texas. 
 
 Land Investment Segment - Barnwell invests in land interests in Hawaii. 
 
 Contract Drilling Segment - Barnwell provides well drilling services and water pumping system installation and repairs in Hawaii. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Segment 
 
 Overview 
 
 Barnwell acquires and develops crude oil and natural gas assets in the province of Alberta, Canada via two corporate entities, Barnwell of Canada and Octavian Oil. Barnwell of Canada is a U.S. incorporated company that has been active in Canada for over 50 years, primarily as a non-operator participating in exploration projects operated by others. Octavian Oil is a Canadian company incorporated in 2016 to achieve growth through the acquisition and development of crude oil reserves. Additionally, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries BOK Drilling, LLC BOK ), established in February 2021, and Barnwell Texas, LLC Barnwell Texas ), established in November 2022, Barnwell is involved in oil and natural gas investments in Oklahoma and Texas, respectively. 
 
 Strategy 
 
 Barnwell s Canadian oil and natural gas assets are currently managed as two categories based on their differing attributes and strategies: Twining and Legacy. 
 
 Twining represents 73 of Barnwell s fiscal 2023 Boe production and consists of assets in the Twining field, in Alberta, Canada. These assets were purchased in August 2018 and were augmented with subsequent smaller acquisitions of partners. These assets are partially operated by the Company and partially operated by Pine Cliff Energy Ltd. The oil wells operated by the Company have largely less than 15 per year decline rates, and due to these lower decline rates, require less capital investment to replace decline. This lower capital requirement along with the fact that the land is largely held indefinitely, enables development drilling to be done when commodity prices support it. Since Barnwell s entry into the Twining property, we have participated in drilling 11 gross horizontal development wells that were completed with multi-stage sand fracs, all of which have been or are forecast to be profitable. Of these 11 wells, two are 100 -owned operated wells in locations selected by Barnwell and nine gross (2.6 net) are non-operated wells. Barnwell plans to continue to develop the pool with more horizontal wells if commodity prices continue to support their profitability. 
 
 5 

The Legacy assets represent 8 of Barnwell s fiscal 2023 Boe production and consist of the largely non-operated Canadian oil and natural gas assets not in the Twining area. The Legacy assets are located throughout Alberta, Canada, and produce shallow gas and conventional oil from a variety of pools. These assets have been accumulated over decades of Barnwell activity. Barnwell continues to evaluate opportunities to either divest the legacy Canadian assets or add to them through acquiring working interests depending on technical and economic evaluations. Minimal capital is expected to be invested in these properties. 
 
 In Oklahoma, which produced 9 of Barnwell s fiscal 2023 Boe production, the Company has non-operated working interests in seven wells varying from 1.2 to 4.2 and a minor overriding royalty interest, 0.07 , in one well. 
 
 In December 2022, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with an independent third party to acquire a 22.3 non-operated working interest in oil and natural gas leasehold acreage in the Permian Basin in Texas. In connection with the purchase of such leasehold interests, Barnwell acquired a 15.4 non-operated working interest in two oil wells in the Wolfcamp Formation in Loving and Ward Counties, Texas. Two gross (0.3 net) wells were drilled and began producing in late April 2023. Additional drilling opportunities in the U.S. are being investigated. These wells produced 10 of Barnwell s fiscal 2023 Boe production, but were only producing for five months. 
 
 Operations 
 
 All acquisitions, operational and developmental activities in the Twining area are the responsibility of the President and Chief Operating Officer of Barnwell of Canada and Octavian Oil with approvals for major expenditures secured from Barnwell s executive management and, when applicable, the Board of Directors. 
 
 Our oil and natural gas segment revenues, profitability, and future rate of growth are dependent upon oil and natural gas prices and the Company s ability to use its current cash, obtain external financing or generate sufficient cash flows to fund the development of our reserves. In the recent past, the industry experienced a period of low oil and natural gas prices that negatively impacted our past operating results, cash flows and liquidity. Credit and capital markets for oil and natural gas markets are volatile. We may seek to raise additional capital if such proceeds are considered attractive and would support potential growth. 
 
 Natural gas prices are typically higher in the winter than at other times due to increased heating demand. Oil prices also are subject to seasonal fluctuations, but to a lesser degree. Oil and natural gas unit sales are based on the quantity produced from the properties by the respective property operators. Prices received in Canada also have been negatively impacted by the lack of export pipeline capacity. 
 
 Preparation of Reserve Estimates 
 
 Barnwell s reserves are estimated by our independent petroleum reserve engineers, InSite Petroleum Consultants Ltd. InSite in Canada and Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Ryder Scott in the U.S., in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and techniques and rules and regulations of the SEC. All information with respect to the Company s Canadian reserves in this Form 10-K is derived from the report of InSite, which is filed with this Form 10-K as Exhibit 99.1. All information with respect to the Company s U.S. reserves in this Form 10-K is derived from the reports of Ryder Scott, which are filed with this Form 10-K as Exhibits 99.2 and 99.3. 
 6 

The preparation of data used by the independent petroleum reserve engineers to compile our oil and natural gas reserve estimates was completed in accordance with various internal control procedures which include verification of data input into reserves evaluation software, reconciliations and reviews of data provided to the independent petroleum reserve engineers to ensure completeness, and management review controls, including an independent internal review of the final reserve report for completeness and accuracy. 
 
 Barnwell has a Reserves Committee consisting of two independent directors and Barnwell's CEO. The Reserves Committee was established to ensure the independence of the Company s petroleum reserve engineers. The Reserves Committee is responsible for reviewing the annual reserve evaluation reports prepared by the independent petroleum reserve engineering firms and ensuring that the reserves are reported fairly in a manner consistent with applicable standards. The Reserves Committee meets annually to discuss reserve issues and policies and to meet with Company personnel and the independent petroleum reserve engineers. 
 
 The President and Chief Operating Officer of Barnwell of Canada and Octavian Oil is a professional engineer with over 25 years of relevant experience in the oil and natural gas industry in Canada and is a member of the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta. 
 
 Reserves 
 
 At September 30, 2023, Barnwell s reserves were approximately 43 operated and consisted of 52 conventional oil and natural gas liquids and 48 natural gas. At September 30, 2022, Barnwell s reserves were approximately 54 operated and consisted of 56 conventional oil and natural gas liquids and 44 natural gas. This change in reserves was largely due to our Texas investment in two non-operated wells. 
 
 The amounts set forth in the following table, based on our independent reserve engineers evaluation of our reserves, summarize our estimated proved reserves of oil (including natural gas liquids) and natural gas as of September 30, 2023 for all properties located in Canada and the U.S. in which Barnwell has an interest. All of our oil and natural gas reserves are based on constant dollar price and cost assumptions. The Company emphasizes that reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and that estimates of new discoveries and undeveloped locations are more imprecise than estimates of established proved producing oil and natural gas properties. Accordingly, these estimates are expected to change as future information becomes available. Proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions (i.e., prices and costs) existing at the time the estimate is made. Proved developed oil and natural gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells and equipment in place and under operating methods being utilized at the time the estimates were made. No estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves have been filed with, or included in reports to, any federal authority or agency, other than the SEC, since October 1, 2022.

As of September 30, 2023 Estimated Net Proved Developed Reserves Estimated Net Proved Undeveloped Reserves Estimated Net Proved Reserves Oil, including natural gas liquids (Bbls) 1,116,000 110,000 1,226,000 Natural gas (Mcf) 6,093,000 608,000 6,701,000 Total (Boe) 2,132,000 211,000 2,343,000 
 
 During fiscal 2023, Barnwell s total net proved developed reserves of oil and natural gas liquids increased by 70,000 Bbls (7 and total net proved developed reserves of natural gas increased by 1,236,000 Mcf (25 ), for a combined increase of 249,000 Boe (13 ). The increase in natural gas reserves were primarily the result of the wells drilled in Texas and Canada in the current year. 
 
 The following table sets forth Barnwell s oil and natural gas net reserves at September 30, 2023, by location and property name, based on information prepared by our independent reserve engineers, as well as net production and net revenues by location and property name for the year ended September 30, 2023. The reserve data in this table is based on constant dollars where reserve estimates are based on sales prices, costs and statutory tax rates using a historical average price of the first day pricing of the last 12-months ending with September 2023.

 Net proved reserves that are attributable to existing producing wells are primarily determined using decline curve analysis and rate transient analysis, which incorporates the principles of hydrocarbon flow. Net proved reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations are estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. Technologies relied on to establish reasonable certainty of economic producibility include electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available production data, seismic data and well test data.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows 
 
 The following table sets forth Barnwell s Estimated Future Net Revenues from total proved oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves located in Canada and the U.S. and the present value of Barnwell s Estimated Future Net Revenues (discounted at 10 as of September 30, 2023. Estimated future net revenues for total proved reserves are net of estimated future expenditures of developing and producing the proved reserves, and assume the continuation of existing economic conditions. Net revenues have been calculated using the average first-day-of-the-month price during the 12-month period ending as of the balance sheet date and current costs, after deducting all royalties, operating costs, future estimated capital expenditures (including abandonment costs), and income taxes. The amounts below include future cash flows from reserves that are currently proved undeveloped reserves and do not deduct general and administrative or interest expenses. 
 Year ending September 30, 2024 7,993,000 2025 5,654,000 2026 3,900,000 Thereafter 2,413,000 Undiscounted future net cash flows, after income taxes 19,960,000 Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 19,913,000 
 _______________________________________________ 
 This amount does not purport to represent, nor should it be interpreted as, the fair value of Barnwell s oil and natural gas reserves. An estimate of fair value would also consider, among other items, the value of Barnwell s undeveloped land position, the recovery of reserves not presently classified as proved, anticipated future changes in oil and natural gas prices (these amounts were based on a natural gas price of 2.54 per Mcf and an oil price of 69.66 per Bbl) and costs, and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in reserve estimates. 
 
 Barnwell has included all abandonment, decommissioning and reclamation costs and inactive well costs into the Company s reserve reports in accordance with best practice recommendations. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Production 
 
 The following table summarizes (a) Barnwell s net production for the last three fiscal years, based on sales of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids, from all wells in which Barnwell has or had an interest, and (b) the average sales prices and average production costs for such production during the same periods. Production amounts reported are net of royalties. All of Barnwell s net production in fiscal 2023 was derived in Alberta, Canada and in the U.S. states of Oklahoma and Texas. Barnwell s net production in fiscal 2022 and 2021 was derived in Alberta, Canada and in Oklahoma. For a discussion regarding our total annual production volumes, average sales prices, and related production costs, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Barnwell s capital expenditures were primarily for the drilling of new wells in Texas and the Twining area. 
 
 Barnwell invested 11,052,000 in oil and natural gas properties during fiscal 2022, including accrued capital expenditures and acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and excluding additions and revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations. Barnwell s capital expenditures were primarily for the drilling of wells in the Twining area, for facilities expansion and upgrade costs in the Twining area and the acquisition of additional working interests in several wells in the Twining area. 
 
 Well Drilling Activities 
 
 The Company participated in the drilling of three gross (0.9 net) non-operated development wells in the Twining area of Alberta, Canada during the year ended September 30, 2023. Total capital expenditures for the year ended September 30, 2023 totaled approximately 4,770,000 and included the drilling, completion and equipping of the three gross (0.9 net) wells along with various upgrades to the Twining facilities. Additionally, the Company participated in the drilling of two gross (0.3 net) non-operated development oil wells in Texas which began producing in late April 2023. Capital expenditures incurred for the drilling of these two wells totaled approximately 4,293,00 during the year ended September 30, 2023. The Company did not drill or participate in the drilling of wells in Oklahoma during the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 In fiscal 2022, the Company participated in the drilling of six gross (1.7 net) non-operated development wells in the Twining area. Capital expenditures incurred by the Company for these non-operated development wells totaled 4,366,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Five gross (1.4 
 10 

net) wells were producing at September 30, 2022 and the remaining one gross (0.3 net) well was awaiting tie-in and started producing in fiscal 2023. The Company drilled one gross (1.0 net) operated development well in the Twining area which was producing at September 30, 2022. Capital expenditures incurred by the Company for this operated well was 2,852,000. The Company did not drill or participate in the drilling of wells in Oklahoma during the year ended September 30, 2022. 
 
 In fiscal 2021, the Company participated in the drilling of seven gross (0.2 net) non-operated development wells in Oklahoma. Capital expenditures incurred by the Company for these Oklahoma wells totaled 1,178,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The Company did not drill or participate in the drilling of wells in Canada during the year ended September 30, 2021. 
 
 Producing Wells 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, Barnwell has interests in 145 gross (65.7 net) producing wells in Alberta, Canada, of which 95 gross (59.3 net) were oil wells and 50 gross (6.4 net) were natural gas wells. Additionally, Barnwell has interests in seven gross (0.2 net) and two gross (0.3 net) producing oil wells in Oklahoma and Texas, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Developed Acreage and Undeveloped Acreage 
 
 The following table sets forth the gross and net acres of both developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas leases in Canada which Barnwell held as of September 30, 2023. The acreage of developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas leases in the U.S. are not significant and are therefore not included in the table below. 
 Developed Acreage Undeveloped Acreage Total Location Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Canada 136,220 33,980 27,110 8,710 163,330 42,690 
 _________________________________________________ 
 Developed Acreage includes the acres covered by leases upon which there are one or more producing wells. Undeveloped Acreage includes acres covered by leases upon which there are no producing wells and which are maintained by the payment of delay rentals or the commencement of drilling thereon. 
 
 Eighty-three percent of Barnwell s undeveloped acreage is not subject to expiration at September 30, 2023. Seventeen percent of Barnwell s leasehold interests in undeveloped acreage is subject to expiration and may expire over the next five fiscal years, if not developed, as follows: 6 expire during fiscal 2024; no expirations during fiscal 2025; 2 expire during fiscal 2026; 5 expire during fiscal 2027; and 4 expire during fiscal 2028. There can be no assurance that Barnwell will be successful in renewing its leasehold interests in the event of expiration. 
 
 Barnwell s undeveloped acreage includes a significant concentration in the Twining area (4,040 net acres). The remaining undeveloped acreage is at non-operated properties over which we do not have control, and the value of such acreage is not estimated to be significant at current commodity prices. 
 
 Marketing of Oil and Natural Gas 
 
 Barnwell sells its Canadian oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production, including under short-term contracts between itself and two main oil purchasers, one natural gas purchaser, and one natural gas liquids purchaser. The prices received are freely negotiated between buyers and sellers and are 
 11 

determined from transparent posted prices adjusted for quality and transportation differentials. In fiscal 2023, 95 of Barnwell s Canadian oil and natural gas revenues were from products sold at spot prices. 
 
 In November 2023, to provide partial protection against the risk of declining natural gas prices during the second half of our fiscal 2024, the Company amended certain of its Canadian purchase and sales contracts to change the sales price on a portion of the natural gas it sells to a fixed price during the period from April 1, 2024 to October 31, 2024. With these changes, the Company anticipates that during that period approximately 25 of its Canadian natural gas production will be sold at fixed prices while the remaining 75 of such production will continue to be sold at spot prices. 
 
 Additionally, in December 2023, the Company amended certain of its Canadian purchase and sales contract to change the sales price on a portion of the oil it sells to a fixed price during the period from January 1, 2024 to June 30, 2024. With these changes, the Company anticipates that during that period approximately 40 of its Canadian oil production will be sold at fixed prices while the remaining 60 of such production will continue to be sold at spot prices. 
 
 In fiscal 2023 and 2022, Barnwell took most of its Canadian oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas in kind where Barnwell markets the products instead of having the operator of a producing property market the products on Barnwell s behalf. We sell oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids to a variety of energy marketing companies. Because our products are commodities for which there are numerous marketers, we are not dependent upon one purchaser or a small group of purchasers. Accordingly, the loss of any single purchaser would not materially affect our revenues. 
 
 Governmental Regulation 
 
 The jurisdictions in which the oil and natural gas properties of Barnwell are located have regulatory provisions relating to permits for the drilling of wells, the spacing of wells, the prevention of oil and natural gas waste, allowable rates of production, environmental protection, and other matters. The amount of oil and natural gas produced is subject to control by regulatory agencies in each province. The province of Alberta and the Government of Canada also monitor the volume of natural gas that may be removed from the province and the conditions of removal; currently all our Canadian natural gas is sold within Alberta. 
 
 All of Barnwell s Canadian gross revenues were derived from properties located within Alberta, which charges oil and natural gas producers a royalty for production within the province. Provincial royalties are calculated as a percentage of revenue and vary depending on production volumes, selling prices and the date of discovery. Barnwell also pays gross overriding royalties and leasehold royalties on a portion of its oil and natural gas sales to parties other than the province of Alberta. 
 
 Under the current royalty framework for newly drilled wells, the same royalty calculation applies to both oil and natural gas wells and royalties are determined on a revenue minus cost basis where producers pay a flat royalty rate of 5 of gross revenues until a well reaches payout after which an increased post-payout royalty applies. Post payout royalties vary with commodity prices and well production rates. 
 
 In fiscal 2023, 76 of Canadian royalties were related to Alberta government charges and 24 of royalties were related to freehold, overriding royalties and other charges. 
 
 12 

In fiscal 2023, the weighted-average royalty rate paid on all of Barnwell s Canadian natural gas was 10 , and the weighted-average royalty rate paid on oil was 17 . In fiscal 2023, the weighted-average royalty rate paid on all of Oklahoma s and Texas s production was 23 and 26 , respectively. 
 
 In June 2021, the AER announced that the previous Licensee Liability Program LLP would be replaced by a Licensee Life-Cycle Management Program via a Licensee Capability Assessment LCA ). The LCA is intended to be a more comprehensive assessment of corporate health and considers a wider variety of factors than those considered under the LLP and establishes clear expectations for industry with regards to the management of liabilities throughout the entire lifecycle of oil and gas projects. Factors considered are grouped into six factor groups, these being current financial distress, liability magnitude, resources lifespan, operations compliance, closure efficiency, and administrative compliance. These factors are compared to peer operators and ranked into three Tiers. Barnwell s assessment under the LCA Program is currently favorable with Tier 1 or 2 overall rankings in the six factor groups. Barnwell believes it can continue to manage its operations to maintain a favorable ranking. Importantly, an inventory reduction program also has been implemented which requires mandatory annual minimum expenditures towards outstanding decommissioning and reclamation obligations in accordance with AER targets which are adjusted by the AER on an annual basis. The target for 2024 is 6.6 of an individual company s inactive liability. These targets became effective January 1, 2022. Barnwell believes the targets assessed by the AER are within estimated forecasts for Barnwell s future ARO spending and therefore the Company will be in compliance with spend targets under the Inventory Reduction Program. 
 
 In September 2019, the AER issued an abandonment/closure order for all wells and facilities in the Manyberries area which had been largely operated by LGX, an operating company that went into receivership in 2016. The estimated asset retirement obligation for the Company's interest in the wells and facilities in the Manyberries area is included in Asset retirement obligation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 After the abandonment/closure order was issued for Manyberries, the OWA created a Working Interest Partners WIP program for specific areas where there are a significant number of orphaned wells to abandon. The OWA has the ability and expertise to abandon wells using its internal resources and network of service providers resulting in efficiencies that companies such as Barnwell would not be able to obtain on its own. Under the WIP program, the Company would be required to provide payment for only Barnwell s working interest share, however, all WIP s would have to participate in the program for the OWA to begin its work. In March 2021, the Company was notified by the OWA that Barnwell s Manyberries wells were confirmed to be in the WIP program. 
 
 Under the agreement with the OWA, the Company is required to pay the abandonment and reclamation costs in advance through a cash deposit. The total cash deposit amount was calculated to be approximately 1,525,000 and the Company paid 888,000 of the total deposit in July and August 2021 and may need to pay the remaining balance of 637,000 by August 2024. The Company revised its Manyberries ARO liability based on the OWA s revised abandonment and reclamation estimates. Based on a review of the details of the cash deposit calculation provided by the OWA, which includes amounts added for possible contingencies, the Company believes the required cash deposit amount by the OWA is higher than the actual costs of the asset retirement obligation for the Manyberries wells and that any excess of the deposit over actual asset retirement costs for the first phase of the work would be credited toward the second phase of the work. A remaining excess deposit, if any, would ultimately be refunded to the Company upon completion of all of the work. As at September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a cumulative reduction in the deposit balance of 300,000 for work performed under this program. 
 
 13 

Over the past seven years, the Company has worked to reduce its abandonment and reclamation obligations associated with its oil and natural gas segment, both by divesting low-productivity assets and actively closing wells and sites. Twenty-three Barnwell-operated sites have been certified as fully reclaimed or exempt since 2016. To aid in this regard, and as a stimulus response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Canadian Federal Government created and funded the Alberta-administered Site Rehabilitation Program SRP in spring 2020. The SRP has been designed to reduce oil and gas industry liabilities by funding vendors who perform closure work. In partnership with its vendors, Barnwell-operated sites have received 388,000 in net funding to date, to be directed to ARO reduction activities. Barnwell has further benefited from grants allocated to its non-operated property partners amounting to 120,000. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Barnwell competes in the sale of oil and natural gas on the basis of price and on the ability to deliver products. The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive in all phases, including the acquisition and development of new production and reserves and the acquisition of equipment and labor necessary to conduct drilling activities. The competition comes from numerous major oil companies as well as numerous other independent operators. There also is competition between the oil and natural gas industry and other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Barnwell is a minor participant in the industry and competes in its oil and natural gas activities with many other companies having far greater financial, technical and other resources. 
 
 Land Investment Segment 
 
 Overview 
 
 Barnwell owns a 77.6 interest in Kaupulehu Developments, a Hawaii general partnership Kaupulehu Developments that has the right to receive payments from KD I and KD II resulting from the sale of lots and/or residential units by KD I and KD II within the approximately 870 acres of the Kaupulehu Lot 4A area in two increments Increment I and Increment II ), located approximately six miles north of the Kona International Airport in the North Kona District of the island of Hawaii. Kaupulehu Developments also holds an interest in approximately 1,000 acres of vacant leasehold land zoned conservation located adjacent to Lot 4A under a lease that terminates in December 2025, which currently has no development potential without both a development agreement with the lessor and zoning reclassification. 
 
 Barnwell, through two limited liability limited partnerships, KD Kona and KKM Makai KKM ), holds a non-controlling ownership interest in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships comprised of KD Kukio Resorts, KD Maniniowali, and KDK. The Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships own certain real estate and development rights interests in the Kukio, Maniniowali and Kaupulehu portions of Kukio Resort, a private residential community on the Kona coast of the island of Hawaii, as well as Kukio Resort s real estate sales office operations. KDK holds interests in KD I and KD II. KD I is the developer of Increment I, and KD II is the developer of Increment II. Barnwell's ownership interests in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 
 
 14 

Operations 
 
 In the 1980s, Kaupulehu Developments obtained the state and county zoning changes necessary to permit development of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka`upulehu and Hualalai Golf Club, which opened in 1996, a second golf course, and single-family and multi-family residential units. These projects were developed by an unaffiliated entity on leasehold land acquired from Kaupulehu Developments. 
 
 In the 1990s and 2000s, Kaupulehu Developments obtained the state and county zoning changes necessary to permit development of single-family and multi-family residential units, a golf course and a limited commercial area on approximately 870 leasehold acres, known as Lot 4A, zoned for resort/residential development, located adjacent to and north of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka`upulehu. In 2004 and 2006, Kaupulehu Developments sold its leasehold interest in Kaupulehu Lot 4A to KD I's and KD II's predecessors in interest, which was prior to Barnwell s affiliation with KD I and KD II which commenced on November 27, 2013, the acquisition date of our ownership interest in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships. 
 
 Increment I is an area of 80 single-family lots, 78 of which were sold from 2006 to 2023, and a beach club on the portion of the property bordering the Pacific Ocean. The purchasers of the 80 single-family lots also have the right to apply for membership in the Kuki`o Golf and Beach Club, which is located adjacent to and south of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka`upulehu. Increment II is the remaining portion of the approximately 870-acre property and is zoned for single-family and multi-family residential units and a golf course and clubhouse. Two residential lots of approximately two to three acres in size fronting the ocean were developed within Increment II and sold by KD II, and the remaining acreage within Increment II is not yet under development. It is uncertain when or if KD II will develop the other areas of Increment II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II. The remaining 420 developable acres at Increment II are entitled for up to 350 homesites. No definitive development plans have been made by KDII, the developer of Increment II, as of the date of this report. 
 
 Kaupulehu Developments is entitled to receive payments from KD I based on 10 of the gross receipts from KD I's sales of single-family residential lots in Increment I. In fiscal 2023, one single-family lot was sold and two single-family lots, of the 80 lots developed within Increment I, remained to be sold as of September 30, 2023. The developer had consolidated these two remaining lots into one large lot but has since split them back into the original two lots. 
 
 In March 2019, KD II admitted a new development partner, Replay Kaupulehu Development, LLC Replay ), a party unrelated to Barnwell, in an effort to move forward with development of the remainder of Increment II at Kaupulehu. KDK and Replay hold ownership interests of 55 and 45 , respectively, of KD II and Barnwell has a 10.8 indirect non-controlling ownership interest in KD II through KDK, which is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Barnwell continues to have an indirect 19.6 non-controlling ownership interest in KD Kukio Resorts, KD Maniniowali, and KD I. 
 
 Under the terms of the Increment II agreement with KD II, Kaupulehu Developments is entitled to 15 of the distributions of KD II, the cost of which is to be solely borne by KDK out of its 55 ownership interest in KD II, plus a priority payout of 10 of KDK s cumulative net profits derived from Increment II sales subsequent to Phase 2A, up to a maximum of 3,000,000 as to the priority payout. Such interests are limited to distributions or net profits interests and Barnwell does not have any partnership interests in KD II or KDK through its interest in Kaupulehu Developments. The arrangement 
 15 

also gives Barnwell rights to three single-family residential lots in Phase 2A of Increment II, and four single-family residential lots in phases subsequent to Phase 2A when such lots are developed by KD II, all at no cost to Barnwell. Barnwell is committed to commence construction of improvements within 90 days of the transfer of the four lots in the phases subsequent to Phase 2A as a condition of the transfer of such lots. Also, in addition to Barnwell s existing obligations to pay professional fees to certain parties based on percentages of its gross receipts, Kaupulehu Developments also is obligated to pay an amount equal to 0.72 and 0.2 of the cumulative net profits of KD II to KD Development and a pool of various individuals, respectively, all of whom are partners of KKM and are unrelated to Barnwell, in compensation for the agreement of these parties to admit the new development partner, Replay, for Increment II. Such compensation will be reflected as the obligation becomes probable and the amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. 
 
 In fiscal 2023, the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships sold one lot in Increment I and as a result of the lot sale, made cash distributions to its partners of which Barnwell received 758,000 resulting in a net amount of 674,000, after distributing 84,000 to non-controlling interests. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Barnwell s land investment segment is subject to intense competition in all phases of its operations including the acquisition of new properties, the securing of approvals necessary for land rezoning, and the search for potential buyers of property interests presently owned. The competition comes from numerous independent land development companies and other industries involved in land investment activities. The principal factors affecting competition are the location of the project and pricing. Barnwell is a minor participant in the land development industry and competes in its land investment activities with many other entities having far greater financial and other resources. 
 
 Contract Drilling Segment 
 
 Overview 
 
 Barnwell s wholly-owned subsidiary, Water Resources, drills water and water monitoring wells of varying depths in Hawaii, installs and repairs water pumping systems, and is the distributor for Trillium Flow Technologies, previously known as Floway, pumps and equipment in the state of Hawaii. 
 
 Operations 
 
 Water Resources owns and operates three water well drilling rigs, two pump rigs and other ancillary drilling and pump equipment. Additionally, Water Resources leases month-to-month a storage facility in Honolulu, Hawaii, and a one-acre maintenance and storage facility with 2,800 square feet of interior space in Kawaihae, Hawaii. Water Resources also maintains an inventory of uninstalled materials for jobs in progress and an inventory of drilling materials and pump supplies. 
 
 Water Resources currently operates in Hawaii and is not subject to seasonal fluctuations. The demand for Water Resources services is primarily dependent upon land development activities in Hawaii. Water Resources markets its services to land developers and government agencies, and identifies potential contracts through public notices, and referrals. Contracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled and are negotiated with private entities or obtained through competitive bidding with private entities or local, state and federal agencies. Contract revenues are not dependent upon the discovery of water or other 
 16 

similar targets, and contracts are not subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the governmental entities involved. Contracts provide for arbitration in the event of disputes. 
 
 In fiscal 2023, Water Resources sold a drilling rig to an independent third party for proceeds of 551,000, net of related costs, and recognized a 551,000 gain on the sale of the drilling rig during the year ended September 30, 2023, as the rig was fully depreciated. In fiscal 2022, Water Resources sold a drilling rig and related ancillary equipment to an independent third party for proceeds of 687,000, net of related costs, which was equivalent to its net carrying value. 
 
 In fiscal 2023, Water Resources started two well drilling and three pump installation and repair contracts and completed three well drilling and nine pump installation and repair contracts. Of the three completed well drilling contracts, two were started in fiscal 2021 and one was started in fiscal 2022. Of the nine completed pump installation and repair contracts, one was started in fiscal 2015, one was started in fiscal 2017, two were started in fiscal 2021, two were started in fiscal 2022, and three were started in the current year. Fifty-two percent of well drilling and pump installation and repair jobs, representing 8 of total contract drilling revenues in fiscal 2023, have been pursuant to government contracts. 
 
 At September 30, 2023, there was a backlog of four well drilling and seven pump installation and repair contracts, of which three well drilling and four pump installation and repair contracts were in progress as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 The approximate dollar amount of Water Resources backlog of firm well drilling and pump installation and repair contracts at December 1, 2023 and 2022 was as follows: 
 December 1, 2023 2022 Well drilling 5,900,000 10,000,000 Pump installation and repair 900,000 1,200,000 6,800,000 11,200,000 
 
 Of the contracts in backlog at December 1, 2023, 6,300,000 is expected to be recognized in fiscal 2024 with the remainder to be recognized in the following fiscal year. 
 
 Sale of Water Resources 
 
 In December 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with a construction company for the sale of Water Resources for gross proceeds of 2,000,000, subject to customary post-closing price adjustments and the purchaser s completion of due diligence. The sale is expected to close in the first half of our fiscal 2024. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Water Resources competes with other drilling contractors in Hawaii, some of which use drill rigs similar to Water Resources . These competitors also are capable of installing and repairing vertical turbine and submersible water pumping systems in Hawaii. These contractors compete actively with Water Resources for government and private contracts. Pricing is Water Resources major method of competition; reliability of service also is a significant factor. 
 
 17 

Competitive pressures are expected to remain high, thus there is no assurance that the quantity or values of available or awarded jobs which occurred in fiscal 2023 will continue. 
 
 Financial Information About Industry Segments and Geographic Areas 
 
 Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 contains information on our segments and geographic areas. 
 
 Employees 
 
 At December 1, 2023, Barnwell employed 37 individuals; 36 on a full time basis and 1 on a part-time basis. 
 
 Environmental Costs 
 Barnwell is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations. U.S. Federal and state and Canadian Federal and provincial governmental agencies issue rules and regulations and enforce laws to protect the environment which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply, particularly in regard to the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws, which are constantly changing, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and maintenance of surface conditions and may require Barnwell to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites where it has a working interest. 
 
 For further information on environmental remediation, see the Contingencies section included in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwell s other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially negatively impacted. 
 
 Entity-Wide Risks 
 
 Stockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing, satisfy obligations through the issuance of securities or use our stock as consideration in certain transactions. 
 
 Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, subject to the requirements of the NYSE American and applicable law, to issue all shares of our common stock or warrants or other instruments to purchase such shares of our common stock. In addition, we may raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions would result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders and may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. A related effect of such issuances may enhance existing large stockholders influence on the Company, including that of Alexander Kinzler, our Chief Executive Officer. 
 
 A small number of stockholders, including our CEO, own a significant amount of our common stock and may have influence over the Company. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, the CEO, who is a member of the Board of Directors, and two other stockholders hold approximately 44 of our outstanding common stock. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company. 
 
 Our operations are subject to currency rate fluctuations. 
 
 Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar which may affect the relative prices at which we sell our oil and natural gas and may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks. 
 
 Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwell s results and financial condition. 
 
 Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, levels of interest rates, and the cost of health care insurance premiums. 
 19 

The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. 
 
 The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including: 
 
 fluctuations in commodity prices; 
 variations in results of operations; 
 announcements by us and our competitors; 
 legislative or regulatory changes; 
 general trends in the industry; 
 general market conditions; 
 litigation; and 
 other events applicable to our industries. 
 
 Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. 
 
 We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business. In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market. Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. Further, there are significant personal liability risks to Barnwell of Canada's individual officers and directors related to well clean-up costs that may affect our ability to attract or retain the necessary people. 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company and benefit from certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements, including that our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot be certain if the omission of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. 
 
 Currently, we are a smaller reporting company, meaning that our outstanding common stock held by nonaffiliates had a value of less than 250 million at the end of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, meaning our auditors are not required to attest to the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors and others may be less comfortable with the effectiveness of the Company s internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, we take advantage of our ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our SEC filings, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures. Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects, as the information we provide to stockholders may be different from what one might receive from other public companies in which one hold shares. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.

We face various risks and uncertainties related to public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences may have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 We face various risks and uncertainties related to public health crises, including the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted financial markets and significantly impacted worldwide economic activity. The future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as mandatory and voluntary actions taken to mitigate the public health impact of the pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic and social and governmental responses to the pandemic have caused, and may continue to cause, severe economic, market and other disruptions worldwide. Although the COVID-19 pandemic and related societal and government responses have not, to date, had a material impact on our business or financial results, the extent to which COVID-19 and related actions may, in the future, impact our operations cannot be predicted with any degree of confidence. As a result, we cannot at this time predict the direct or indirect impact on us of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment 
 
 Acquisitions or discoveries of additional reserves are needed to increase our oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flow. 
 
 In August 2018, Barnwell made a significant reinvestment into its oil and natural gas segment with the acquisition of the Twining property in Alberta, Canada. The Company believes there are potential undeveloped reserves for which significant future capital expenditures will be needed to convert those potential undeveloped reserves into developed reserves. If future circumstances are such that we are not able to make the capital expenditures necessary to convert potential undeveloped reserves to developed reserves, we will not replace the amount of reserves produced and sold and our reserves and oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flows will decline accordingly, and we may be forced to sell some of our oil and natural gas segment assets under untimely or unfavorable terms. Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Future oil and natural gas operating results and cash flow are highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing or acquiring additional reserves and our current financial resources may be insufficient to make such investments. Furthermore, if oil or natural gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves also could increase. 
 
 We may not realize an adequate return on oil and natural gas investments. 
 
 Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. If future oil and natural gas segment acquisition and development activities are not successful it could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 21 

Oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile and further declines, or extended low prices will significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Much of our revenues and cash flow are greatly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, if any. Prices that do not produce sufficient operating margins will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas reserves. 
 
 Various factors beyond our control affect prices of oil and natural gas including, but not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. Energy prices also are subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the U.S. in anticipation of or in response to such developments. 
 
 The inability of one or more of our working interest partners to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results. 
 
 For our operated properties, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. Some of our non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations. Nonperformance by a non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses. 
 
 Liquidity problems encountered by our working interest partners or the third party operators of our non-operated properties also may result in significant financial losses as the other working interest partners or third party operators may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. In the event a third party operator of a non-operated property becomes insolvent, it may result in increased operating expenses and cash required for abandonment liabilities if the Company is required to take over operatorship. 
 
 We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. 
 
 The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of clean up orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations. Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. 
 
 Barnwell's oil and natural gas segment is subject to the provisions of the AER s Licensee Life-Cycle Management Program via a Licensee Capability Assessment LCA ). Under this program the AER assesses the corporate health of the Company and considers a wider variety of factors than those considered under the previous program. The LCA establishes clear expectations for industry with regards 
 22 

to the management of liabilities throughout the entire lifecycle of oil and gas projects. Factors considered are grouped into six factor groups, these being current financial distress, liability magnitude, resources lifespan, operations compliance, closure efficiency and administrative compliance. These factors are compared to peer operators and ranked into three Tiers . Under the LCA Program, an inventory reduction program has also been implemented which requires mandatory annual minimum expenditures towards outstanding decommissioning and reclamation obligations in accordance with AER targets which are adjusted by the AER on an annual basis. The target for 2024 is 6.6 of an individual company s inactive liability. These targets became effective January 1, 2022. 
 
 The AER may require purchasers of AER licensed oil and natural gas assets to be within Tiers 1 or 2 overall rankings in the six factors group. This requirement for well transfers hinders our ability to generate capital by selling oil and natural gas assets as there are less qualified buyers. 
 
 The AER may require the Company to provide a security deposit if assessed at Tier 3. Diverting funds to the AER in the future would result in the diversion of cash on hand and operating cash flows that could otherwise be used to fund oil and natural gas reserve replacement efforts, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If Barnwell fails to comply with the requirements of the LCA program, Barnwell's oil and natural gas subsidiary would be subject to the AER's enforcement provisions which could include suspension of operations and non-compliance fees and could ultimately result in the AER serving the Company with a closure order to shut-in all operated wells. Additionally, if Barnwell is non-compliant, the Company would be prohibited from transferring well licenses which would prohibit us from selling any oil and natural gas assets until the required cash deposit is made with the AER. 
 
 We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow. Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. 
 
 We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves. 
 
 We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. Our evaluation includes an assessment of reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential for future drilling and production, validity of the seller s title to the properties and potential environmental issues, litigation and other liabilities. 
 
 In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller of the properties may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual 
 23 

indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an as is basis. 
 
 There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. 
 
 If oil and natural gas prices decline and remain low, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties. 
 
 Oil and natural gas prices affect the value of our oil and natural gas properties as determined in our full cost ceiling calculation. Any future ceiling test write-downs will result in reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings. 
 
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. 
 
 We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, most of which have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis. As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. 
 
 An increase in operating costs greater than anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation. The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age. A significant increase in operating costs could negatively impact operating results and cash flow. 
 
 Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. 
 
 Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as U.S. federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. 
 
 24 

We are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of certain of our oil and natural gas properties. 
 
 We hold minority interests in certain of our oil and natural gas properties. As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells, the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, or the timing and amount of costs related to abandonment and reclamation activities although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters. The operator s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures. Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. We also depend on operators and joint operators to maintain the financial resources to fund their share of all abandonment and reclamation costs. 
 
 Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. 
 
 Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others: 
 
 oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by SEC regulations; 
 historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area; 
 future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures; 
 initial production rates; 
 production decline rates; 
 ultimate recovery of reserves; 
 success of future development activities; 
 marketability of production; 
 effects of government regulation; and 
 other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. 
 
 If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates. 
 
 Part of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our drilling are subject to drilling and completion technique risks, and results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production. 
 
 Many of our operations involve, and are planned to utilize, the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by our service providers in order to maximize production and ultimate recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns. Risks we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, the inability to fracture the planned number of stages, the inability to run tools and other equipment the entire length of the well bore during completion operations, the inability to recover such tools and other equipment, and the inability to successfully clean out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation. Ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently 
 25 

long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, limited access to gathering systems and takeaway capacity, and/or prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids decline, then the return on our investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as we anticipated and we could incur material write-downs of oil and gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future. 
 
 Production and reserves, if any, attributable to the use of enhanced recovery methods are inherently difficult to predict. If our enhanced recovery methods do not allow for the extraction of crude oil, natural gas, and associated liquids in a manner or to the extent that we anticipate, we may not realize an acceptable return on our investments in such projects. 
 
 Delays in business operations could adversely affect the amount and timing of our cash inflows. 
 
 In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by: 
 
 restrictions imposed by lenders; 
 accounting delays; 
 delays in the sale or delivery of products; 
 delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system; 
 blowouts or other accidents; 
 adjustments for prior periods; 
 recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and 
 the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. 
 
 Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. 
 
 The oil and natural gas market in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. 
 Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills. A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. 
 
 While we carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable. There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above. We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. 
 26 

Deficiencies in operating practices and record keeping, if any, may increase our risks and liabilities relating to incidents such as spills and releases and may increase the level of regulatory enforcement actions. 
 
 Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the U.S. 
 
 Barnwell s oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the U.S., such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers health and safety. Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta is controlled by the government of that province. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwell s operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada; 67 in fiscal 2023. 
 
 Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S. 
 
 Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers activities, reducing demand for our products and services. 
 
 Legislation, regulation, and other government actions and shifting customer preferences and other private efforts related to greenhouse gas GHG emissions and climate change could increase our operational costs and reduce demand for our oil and natural gas, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Barnwell may experience challenges from the impacts of international and domestic legislation, regulation, or other government actions relating to GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) and climate change. International agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to directly or indirectly limit or reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of implementation. Many of these actions, as well as customers preferences and use of oil and natural gas or substitute products, are beyond the Company s control. Similar to any significant changes in the regulatory environment, GHG emissions and climate change-related legislation, regulation, or other government actions may curtail profitability in the oil and gas sector, or render the extraction of the Company s hydrocarbon resources economically infeasible. In particular, GHG emissions-related legislation, regulations, and other government actions and shifting consumer preferences and other private efforts aimed at reducing GHG emissions may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating, and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for the Company s oil and natural gas; adversely affect the economic feasibility of the Company s resources; impact or limit our 
 27 

business plans; and adversely affect the Company s sales volumes, revenues, margins and reputation. 
 
 The ultimate impact of GHG emissions and climate change-related agreements, legislation, regulation, and government actions on the Company s financial performance is highly uncertain because the Company is unable to predict with certainty, the outcome of political decision-making processes, including the actual laws and regulations enacted, the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes, and market conditions. 
 
 Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations. 
 
 Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders. It also is possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. 
 
 Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. 
 
 Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets. If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. 
 
 Risks Related to Land Investment Segment 
 
 Receipt of future payments from KD I and KD II and cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is dependent upon the developer s continued efforts and ability to develop and market the property. 
 
 We are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential lots sold within the Kaupulehu area by KD I and KD II as well as a percentage of future distributions KD II makes to its members. However, in order to collect such payments we are reliant upon the developer, KD I and KD II, in which we own a non-controlling ownership interest, to continue to market the remaining lots within Increment I and to proceed with the development or sale of the remaining portion of Increment II. Additionally, future cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, which includes KD I and KD II, are also dependent on future lot sales in Increment I by KD I and the development or sale of Increment II by KD II. It is uncertain when or if KD II will develop or sell the remaining portion of Increment II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II. We do not have a controlling interest in the partnerships, and therefore are dependent on the general partner for development decisions. The receipt of future payments and cash distributions could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. 
 
 28 

We hold investment interests in unconsolidated land development partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, in which we do not have a controlling interest. These investments involve risks and are highly illiquid. 
 
 These investments involve risks which include: 
 
 the lack of a controlling interest in these partnerships and, therefore, the inability to require that the entities sell assets, return invested capital or take any other action without obtaining the majority vote of partners; 
 potential for future additional capital contributions to fund operations and development activities; 
 the adverse impact on overall profitability if the entities do not achieve the financial results projected; 
 the reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in indebtedness to pay potential future additional capital contributions, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy; 
 undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs and which could delay or prevent development of the real estate held by the land development partnerships; and 
 certain underlying partnership data is not accessible to us, therefore we depend on the general partner to provide us with reliable accounting information. 
 
 Our land investment business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. 
 
 Barnwell s land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaii s real estate market, which is affected by Hawaii s economy and Hawaii s tourism industry, as well as the U.S. and world economies in general. Any future cash flows from Barnwell s land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaii s economy. 
 
 The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. 
 The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our land investments. The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for real estate in Hawaii. 
 
 Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment 
 
 Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile. A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. 
 
 Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii. The real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, 
 29 

population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results. 
 
 If we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when bidding on or negotiating a contract that is ultimately awarded, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract. 
 
 Contracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled and require the provision of line-item materials at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of actual per unit costs. Under such contracts, prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates, which are based on a number of assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Expected profits on contracts are realized only if costs are accurately estimated and successfully controlled. We may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred as a result of changes or inaccuracies in these estimates and underlying assumptions, such as unanticipated sub-surface site conditions, unanticipated technical problems, equipment failures, inefficiencies, cost of raw materials, schedule delays due to constraints on drilling hours, weather delays, or accidents. If cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if the contract is not performed within cost estimates, then cost overruns may result in losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as expected. 
 
 A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. 
 
 A significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies; 8 in fiscal 2023. Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services. Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. 
 
 Our contract drilling operations face significant competition. 
 
 We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors. Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor. Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected. 
 
 Supply chain and manufacturing issues of well drilling and pump installation equipment could adversely affect our operating results. 
 
 We are dependent on various well drilling and pump installation equipment to conduct our contract drilling segment operations. The shortage of and/or delay in delivery of such equipment, such as pumps, interruptions in supply, and price increases of such equipment and materials due to supply chain issues and manufacturing disruptions could adversely impact our gross margin and results of operations. 
 
 Awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers. 
 
 There can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past. Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results. 
 30 

The contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation. 
 
 Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started. Our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations, and such changes could adversely affect our operations. 
 
 The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. 
 
 The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts.

 Current Outlook 
 
 Impact of COVID-19 
 
 We face various risks and uncertainties related to public health crises, including the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted financial markets and significantly impacted worldwide economic activity. The future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as mandatory and voluntary actions taken to mitigate the public health impact of the pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic and social and governmental responses to the pandemic have caused, and may continue to cause, severe economic, market and other disruptions worldwide. Although the COVID-19 pandemic and related societal and government responses have not, to date, had a material impact on our business or financial results, the extent to which COVID-19 and related actions may, in the future, impact our operations cannot be predicted with any degree of confidence. As a result, we cannot at this time predict the direct or indirect impact on us of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The Company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires the Company to make assumptions that are difficult or subjective about matters that were highly uncertain at the time that the accounting estimate was made, and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur in periods subsequent to the period in which the estimate was made, or use of different estimates that the Company could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. The most critical accounting policies inherent in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements are described below. We continue to monitor our accounting policies to ensure proper application of current rules and regulations. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Properties - full cost ceiling calculation and depletion 
 
 Policy Description 
 
 We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties under which we are required to conduct quarterly calculations of a ceiling, or limitation, on the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties . The ceiling limitation is the sum of 1) the discounted present value (at 10 ), using average first-day-of-the-month prices during the 12-month period ending as of the balance sheet date held constant over the life of the reserves, of Barnwell s estimated future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and natural gas reserves, less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves but excluding future cash outflows associated with settling 
 34 

asset retirement obligations with the exception of those associated with proved undeveloped reserves from wells that are to be drilled in the future; plus 2) the cost of major development projects and unproven properties not subject to depletion, if any; plus 3) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in costs subject to depletion; less 4) related income tax effects. If net capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is expensed. 
 
 All items classified as unevaluated and unproved properties are assessed on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value. Properties are assessed on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of various factors, including, but not limited to, the following: intent to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; assignment of proved reserves; and economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. During any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and become subject to amortization. 
 
 Judgments and Assumptions 
 
 The estimate of our oil and natural gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments. Estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data, historical data, projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly for new discoveries. Our reserve estimates are prepared at least annually by independent petroleum reserve engineers. The passage of time provides more quantitative and qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves, and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information. A portion of the revisions are attributable to changes in the rolling 12-month average first-day-of-the-month prices, which impact the economics of producible reserves. In the last three fiscal years, annual revisions to our reserve volume estimates have averaged 31 of the previous year s estimate, due in large part to the impacts of volatile oil and natural gas prices which change the economic viability of producing such reserves and changes in estimated proved undeveloped reserves which can fluctuate from year to year depending upon the Company's plans and ability to fund the capital expenditures necessary to develop such reserves. There can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future. If future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities, such revisions could result in a write-down of oil and natural gas properties. 
 
 If reported reserve volumes were revised downward by 5 at the end of fiscal 2023, the ceiling limitation would have decreased approximately 1,329,000 before income taxes, which would not have resulted in a ceiling impairment before income taxes due to sufficient room between the ceiling and the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties at the end of fiscal 2023 of approximately 5,428,000. 
 
 In addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling, estimated proved reserves are also a significant component of the quarterly calculation of depletion expense. The lower the estimated reserves, the higher the depletion rate per unit of production. Conversely, the higher the estimated reserves, the lower the depletion rate per unit of production. If reported reserve volumes were revised downward by 5 as of the beginning of fiscal 2023, depletion for fiscal 2023 would have increased by approximately 211,000. 
 
 While the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment, the associated prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves are the average first-day-of-the-month prices during the 12- 
 35 

month period ending in the reporting period on a constant basis as prescribed by SEC regulations. Additionally, the applicable discount rate that is used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves is mandated at 10 . Costs included in future net revenues are determined in a similar manner. As such, the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on an assessment of future prices or costs. 
 
 Contract Drilling Revenues and Operating Expenses 
 
 Policy Description 
 
 Through contracts which are normally less than twelve months in duration, Barnwell drills water and water monitoring wells and installs and repairs water pumping systems in Hawaii. Barnwell recognizes revenue from well drilling or the installation of pumps over time based on total costs incurred on the projects relative to the total expected costs to satisfy the performance obligation as management believes this is an accurate representation of the percentage of completion as control is continuously transferred to the customer. Uninstalled materials, which typically consists of well casing or pumps, are excluded in the costs-to-costs calculation for the duration of the contract as including these costs would result in a distortion of progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation due to the resulting cumulative catch-up in margin in a single period. An equal amount of cost and revenue is recorded when uninstalled materials are controlled by the customer, which is typically when Barnwell has the right to payment for the materials and when the materials are delivered to the customer s site or location and such materials have been accepted by the customer. Uninstalled materials are held in inventory and included in Other current assets on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets until control is transferred to the customer. When the estimate on a contract indicates a loss, Barnwell records the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known. 
 
 Unexpected significant inefficiencies that were not considered a risk at the time of entering into the contract, such as design or construction execution errors that result in significant wasted resources, are excluded from the measure of progress toward completion and the costs are expensed as incurred. 
 
 To the extent a contract is deemed to have multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation using its best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. The contract price may include variable consideration, which includes such items as increases to the transaction price for unapproved change orders and claims for which price has not yet been agreed by the customer. The Company estimates variable consideration using either the most likely amount or expected value method, whichever is a more appropriate reflection of the amount to which it expects to be entitled based on the characteristics and circumstances of the contract. Variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative recognized revenue will not occur. 
 
 Contracts are sometimes modified for a change in scope or other requirements. The Company considers contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Most of the Company s contract modifications are for goods and services that are not distinct from the existing performance obligations. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price, and the measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase or decrease) on a cumulative catchup basis. 
 
 36 

Judgments and Assumptions 
 
 Management evaluates the performance of contracts on an individual basis. In the ordinary course of business, but at least quarterly, we prepare updated estimates that may impact the cost and profit or loss for each contract based on actual results to date plus management s best estimate of costs to be incurred to complete each performance obligation. Increases or decreases in the estimated costs to complete a performance obligation without a change to the contract price has the impact to decrease or increase, respectively, the contract completion percentage applied to the contract price to calculate the cumulative contract revenue to be recognized to date. Changes in the cost estimates can have a material impact on our contract revenue and are reflected in the results of operations when they become known. The nature of accounting for these contracts is such that refinements of the estimated costs to complete may occur and are characteristic of the estimation process due to changing conditions and new developments. Many factors and assumptions can and do change during a contract performance obligation period which can result in a change to contract profitability including unforeseen underground geological conditions (to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable), the availability and costs of skilled contract labor, the performance of major material suppliers, the performance of major subcontractors, unusual weather conditions and unexpected changes in material costs, changes in the scope and nature of work to be performed, and unexpected construction execution errors, among others. Any revisions to estimated costs to complete the performance obligation from period to period as a result of changes in these factors can materially affect revenue and operating results in the period such revisions are necessary. In addition, many contracts give the customer a unilateral right to cancel for convenience or other than for cause. In accordance with FASB ASC 606-10-32-4, our estimates are based on the assumption that the existing contract will not be cancelled. Any unforeseen cancellation of a contract may result in a material revision to our estimates. 
 
 We have a long history of working with multiple types of projects and preparing cost estimates, and we rely on the expertise of key personnel to prepare what we believe are reasonable best estimates given available facts and circumstances. Due to the nature of the work involved, however, judgment is involved to estimate the costs to complete and the amounts estimated could have a material impact on the revenue we recognize in each accounting period. We can not estimate unforeseen events and circumstances which may result in actual results being materially different from previous estimates. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Policy Description 
 
 Income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax impacts of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
 
 Deferred income tax assets are routinely assessed for realizability. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
 
 Barnwell recognizes the financial statement effects of tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained by a taxing authority. 
 37 

Judgments and Assumptions 
 
 We make estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for each reporting period. Significant changes to these estimates could result in an increase or decrease in our tax provision in future periods. We are also required to make judgments about the recoverability of deferred tax assets and when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided. We consider available positive and negative evidence and available tax planning strategies when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets. Accordingly, changes in our business performance and unforeseen events could require a further increase in the valuation allowance or a reversal in the valuation allowance in future periods. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made, and the impact of these changes could be material. 
 
 In addition, Barnwell operates within the U.S. and Canada and is subject to audit by taxing authorities in these jurisdictions. Barnwell records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. Tax benefits are recognized when we determine that it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized. Management evaluates its potential exposures from tax positions taken that have or could be challenged by taxing authorities. These potential exposures result because taxing authorities may take positions that differ from those taken by management in the interpretation and application of statutes, regulations and rules. Management considers the possibility of alternative outcomes based upon past experience, previous actions by taxing authorities (e.g., actions taken in other jurisdictions) and advice from tax experts. Where uncertainty exists due to the complexity of income tax statutes and where the potential tax amounts are significant, we generally seek independent tax opinions to support our positions. If our evaluation of the likelihood of the realization of benefits is inaccurate, we could incur additional income tax and interest expense that would adversely impact earnings, or we could receive tax benefits greater than anticipated which would positively impact earnings, either of which could be material. 
 
 Overview 
 
 Barnwell is engaged in the following lines of business: 1) acquiring, developing, producing and selling oil and natural gas in Canada and the U.S. (oil and natural gas segment), 2) investing in land interests in Hawaii (land investment segment), and 3) drilling wells and installing and repairing water pumping systems in Hawaii (contract drilling segment). 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Segment 
 
 Barnwell is involved in the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties primarily in the Twining area of Alberta, Canada, where we initiate and participate in acquisition and developmental operations for oil and natural gas on properties in which we have an interest, and evaluate proposals by third parties with regard to participation in such exploratory and developmental operations elsewhere. Additionally, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries BOK and Barnwell Texas, Barnwell is involved in non-operated oil and natural gas investments in Oklahoma and Texas, respectively. 
 
 Barnwell sells all of its Canadian and U.S. oil and natural gas under short-term contracts with marketers based on prices indexed to market prices. The price of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids is freely negotiated between the buyers and sellers. Oil and natural gas prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control. Market prices for oil and natural gas products are dependent upon factors such as, but not limited to, changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by overall 
 38 

economic activity, changes in weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, and output. Oil and natural gas prices are very difficult to predict and fluctuate significantly. Natural gas prices tend to be higher in the winter than in the summer due to increased demand, although this trend has become less pronounced due to the increased use of natural gas to generate electricity for air conditioning in the summer and increased natural gas storage capacity in North America. 
 
 In November 2023, to provide partial protection against the risk of declining natural gas prices during the second half of our fiscal 2024, the Company amended certain of its Canadian purchase and sales contracts to change the sales price on a portion of the natural gas it sells to a fixed price during the period from April 1, 2024 to October 31, 2024. With these changes, the Company anticipates that during that period approximately 25 of its Canadian natural gas production will be sold at fixed prices while the remaining 75 of such production will continue to be sold at spot prices. 
 
 Additionally, in December 2023, the Company amended certain of its Canadian purchase and sales contract to change the sales price on a portion of the oil it sells to a fixed price during the period from January 1, 2024 to June 30, 2024. With these changes, the Company anticipates that during that period approximately 40 of its Canadian oil production will be sold at fixed prices while the remaining 60 of such production will continue to be sold at spot prices. 
 
 Oil and natural gas exploration, development and operating costs generally follow trends in product market prices, thus in times of higher product prices the cost of exploring, developing and operating the oil and natural gas properties will tend to escalate as well. Capital expenditures are required to fund the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. Cash outlays for capital expenditures are largely discretionary, however, a minimum level of capital expenditures is required to replace depleting reserves. Due to the nature of oil and natural gas exploration and development, significant uncertainty exists as to the ultimate success of any drilling effort. 
 
 Land Investment Segment 
 
 Through Barnwell s 77.6 interest in Kaupulehu Developments, 75 interest in KD Kona, and 34.45 non-controlling interest in KKM Makai, the Company s land investment interests include the following: 
 
 The right to receive percentage of sales payments from KD I resulting from the sale of single-family residential lots by KD I, within Increment I of the Kaupulehu Lot 4A area located in the North Kona District of the island of Hawaii. Kaupulehu Developments is entitled to receive payments from KD I based on 10 of the gross receipts from KD I s sales at Increment I. Increment I is an area zoned for approximately 80 single-family lots, of which two remained to be sold at September 30, 2023. The developer had consolidated these two remaining lots into one large lot but has since split them back into the original two lots. 
 
 The right to receive 15 of the distributions of KD II, the cost of which is to be solely borne by KDK out of its 55 ownership interest in KD II, plus a priority payout of 10 of KDK's cumulative net profits derived from Increment II sales subsequent to Phase 2A, up to a maximum of 3,000,000. Such interests are limited to distributions or net profits interests and Barnwell does not have any partnership interest in KD II or KDK through its interest in Kaupulehu Developments. Barnwell also has rights to three single-family residential lots in Phase 2A of Increment II, and four single-family residential lots in phases subsequent to Phase 2A when such lots are developed by KD II, all at no cost to Barnwell. Barnwell is 
 39 

committed to commence construction of improvements within 90 days of the transfer of the four lots in the phases subsequent to Phase 2A as a condition of the transfer of such lots. Also, in addition to Barnwell's existing obligations to pay professional fees to certain parties based on percentages of its gross receipts, Kaupulehu Developments is also obligated to pay an amount equal to 0.72 and 0.20 of the cumulative net profits of KD II to KD Development, LLC and a pool of various individuals, respectively, all of whom are partners of KKM and are unrelated to Barnwell. The remaining acreage within Increment II is not yet under development, and there is no assurance that development of such acreage will in fact occur. No definitive development plans have been made by KDII, the developer of Increment II, as of the date of this report. 
 
 An indirect 19.6 non-controlling ownership interest in KD Kukio Resorts, LLLP, KD Maniniowali, LLLP and KD I and an indirect 10.8 non-controlling ownership interest in KD II through KDK. These entities own certain real estate and development rights interests in the Kukio, Maniniowali and Kaupulehu portions of Kukio Resort, a private residential community on the Kona coast of the island of Hawaii, as well as Kukio Resort s real estate sales office operations. KDK was the developer of Kaupulehu Lot 4A Increments I and II. The partnerships derive income from the sale of residential parcels, of which two remained to be sold at September 30, 2023, as well as from commissions on real estate sales by the real estate sales office and revenues resulting from the sale of private club memberships. 
 
 Approximately 1,000 acres of vacant leasehold land zoned conservation in the Kaupulehu Lot 4C area, which currently has no development potential without both a development agreement with the lessor and zoning reclassification. The lease terminates in December 2025. 
 
 Contract Drilling Segment 
 
 Barnwell drills water and water monitoring wells and installs and repairs water pumping systems in Hawaii. Contract drilling results are highly dependent upon the quantity, dollar value and timing of contracts awarded by governmental and private entities and can fluctuate significantly. 
 
 In December 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with a construction company for the sale of Water Resources for gross proceeds of 2,000,000, subject to customary post-closing price adjustments and the purchaser s completion of due diligence. The sale is expected to close in the first half of our fiscal 2024. 
 
 Business Environment 
 
 Our operations are located in Canada and in the states of Hawaii, Oklahoma, and Texas. Accordingly, our business performance is directly affected by macroeconomic conditions in those areas, as well as general economic conditions of the U.S. domestic and world economies. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Segment 
 
 Barnwell realized an average price for oil of 69.77 per barrel during the year ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 20 from 86.73 per barrel realized during the prior year and realized an average price for natural gas of 2.64 per Mcf during the year ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 43 from 4.63 per Mcf realized during the prior year. Oil and natural gas prices continue to be volatile over time 
 40 

and thus, the Company is unable to reasonably predict future prices and the impacts future prices will have on the Company. 
 
 Land Investment Segment 
 
 Future revenues from the sale of interest in leasehold land and any future cash distributions from our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships are dependent upon the sale of the remaining two residential lots within Increment I by KD I and potential future development or sale of the remaining portion of Increment II by KD II of Kaupulehu Lot 4A. The amount and timing of future land investment segment proceeds from percentage of sales payments and cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships are highly uncertain and out of our control, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales of residential lots within Increments I and II. No definitive development plans have been made by KD II, the developer of Increment II, as of the date of this report. 
 
 Contract Drilling Segment 
 
 Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation and repair services is volatile and dependent upon land development activities within the state of Hawaii. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Summary 
 
 Net loss attributable to Barnwell for fiscal 2023 totaled 961,000, a 6,474,000 decrease from net earnings of 5,513,000 in fiscal 2022. The following factors affected the results of operations for the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year: 
 
 A 5,863,000 decrease in oil and natural gas segment operating results, before income taxes, due to significant decreases in natural gas, oil, and natural gas liquid prices. Additionally, a decrease in the net production from wells in Oklahoma in the current year period as compared to the same period in the prior year also caused the decrease; 
 
 Equity in income from affiliates decreased 2,642,000 and land investment segment operating results, before non-controlling interests share of such profits, decreased 941,000 due to the Kukio Resort Development Partnerships' sale of one lot in the current year period, whereas there were six lot sales in the prior year period; 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 1,088,000 primarily due to decreases in share-based compensation, accrued bonus expense, professional fees, and bad debt expense, partially offset by an increase in stockholder costs in the current year period as compared to the same period in the prior year; 
 
 A 551,000 gain recognized in the current year period from the sale of a contract drilling segment drilling rig; and 
 
 A 76,000 foreign currency gain recorded in the current year period as compared to a 484,000 foreign currency loss in the prior year period, primarily due to the effects of foreign exchange 
 41 

rate changes on intercompany loans and advances as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar. 
 
 General 
 
 Barnwell conducts operations in the U.S. and Canada. Consequently, Barnwell is subject to foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses due to fluctuations of the exchange rates between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar. Barnwell cannot accurately predict future fluctuations of the exchange rates and the impact of such fluctuations may be material from period to period. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions. Foreign currency gains or losses on intercompany loans and advances that are not considered long-term investments in nature because management intends to settle these intercompany balances in the future are included in our statements of operations. 
 
 The average exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar decreased 5 in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, and the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar increased 1 at September 30, 2023, as compared to September 30, 2022. Accordingly, the assets, liabilities, stockholders equity and revenues and expenses of Barnwell s subsidiaries operating in Canada have been adjusted to reflect the change in the exchange rates. Other comprehensive income and losses are not included in net earnings and net loss. 
 
 Other comprehensive loss due to foreign currency translation adjustments, net of taxes, for fiscal 2023 was 2,000, a 38,000 change from other comprehensive loss due to foreign currency translation adjustments, net of taxes, of 40,000 in fiscal 2022. There were no taxes on other comprehensive loss due to foreign currency translation adjustments in fiscal 2023 and 2022 due to a full valuation allowance on the related deferred tax assets.

 The oil and natural gas segment generated a 4,673,000 operating profit in fiscal 2023 before general and administrative expenses, a decrease in operating results of 5,863,000 as compared to 10,536,000 of operating profit in fiscal 2022. 
 
 The following table sets forth Barnwell s oil and natural gas segment operating profit before general and administrative expenses by geographic location: 
 Year ended September 30, 2023 2022 Operating profit (before general and administrative expenses) Canada 3,171,000 7,869,000 Oklahoma 1,006,000 2,667,000 Texas 496,000 Total operating profit 4,673,000 10,536,000 
 
 Oil and natural gas revenues decreased 3,205,000 (14 from 22,581,000 in fiscal 2022 to 19,376,000 in fiscal 2023, primarily due to significant decreases in natural gas, oil, and natural gas liquid prices, which decreased 43 , 20 , and 33 , respectively, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was partially offset by 12 and 31 increases in oil and natural gas production, respectively, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in oil and natural gas production in the current year was due to new wells drilled in the Twining area and from new wells drilled in Texas, partially offset by a decrease in production from the Oklahoma wells. 
 43 

The two gross (0.3 net) non-operated wells drilled in Texas began producing in late April 2023 and the Company s share of net production from these wells totaled 12,000 barrels of oil, 12,000 barrels of natural gas liquids, and 121,000 Mcf of natural gas for total revenues of 1,354,000 during the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Oil and natural gas operating expenses increased 995,000 (11 from 9,439,000 in fiscal 2022 to 10,434,000 in fiscal 2023, primarily due to costs associated with new production from wells drilled in the Twining area and from new wells drilled in Texas and an increase in workover costs in the current year period as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in production from wells in Oklahoma in the current year period as compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Oil and natural gas segment depletion increased 1,663,000 (64 from 2,606,000 in fiscal 2022 to 4,269,000 in fiscal 2023, primarily due to depletion attributable to production in Texas, whereas there was no such depletion in the prior year period, and an increase in the depletion rate for Canadian properties and also new production from those properties, both of which were the result of the drilling of new wells and facilities expansion and upgrade costs, all in the Twining area. The increase in oil and natural gas depletion was partially offset by a decrease in depletion for Oklahoma properties due to the decrease in production from wells in Oklahoma in the current year period as compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Oil prices continue to be volatile over time and thus, the Company is unable to reasonably predict future oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and the impacts future prices will have on the Company. 
 
 Sale of interest in leasehold land 
 
 Kaupulehu Developments is entitled to receive a percentage of the gross receipts from the sales of lots and/or residential units in Increment I by KD I. 
 
 The following table summarizes the revenues received from KD I and the amount of fees directly related to such revenues: 
 Year ended September 30, 2023 2022 Sale of interest in leasehold land: Revenues - sale of interest in leasehold land 265,000 1,295,000 Fees - included in general and administrative expenses (32,000) (158,000) Sale of interest in leasehold land, net of fees paid 233,000 1,137,000 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2023, Barnwell received 265,000 in percentage of sales payments from KD I from the sale of one single-family lot within Increment I. During the year ended September 30, 2022, Barnwell received 1,295,000 in percentage of sales payments from KD I from the sale of six single-family lots within Increment I. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, two single-family lots of the 80 lots developed within Increment I remained to be sold. The Company does not have a controlling interest in Increments I and II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II, or that the remaining 
 44 

acreage within Increment II will be developed. No definitive development plans have been made by KD II, the developer of Increment II, as of the date of this report. 
 
 Contract drilling 
 
 Contract drilling revenues and costs are associated with well drilling and water pump installation, replacement and repair in Hawaii. 
 
 The contract drilling segment generated a 428,000 operating loss before general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2023, a decrease in operating results of 206,000 as compared to an operating loss before general and administrative expenses of 222,000 in fiscal 2022. Contract drilling revenues increased 887,000 (20 to 5,427,000 in fiscal 2023, as compared to 4,540,000 in fiscal 2022, primarily due to a higher level of activity in the current year period, partially offset by a decrease in revenues recognized from previously uninstalled materials during the current year period as compared the same period in the prior year. Contract drilling costs increased 1,078,000 (23 to 5,669,000 in fiscal 2023, as compared to 4,591,000 in fiscal 2022, primarily due to a higher level of activity and an increase in costs for certain water well drilling contracts in the current year period due to unforeseen difficulties on two contracts. The first job had a piece of the drill bit break off and fall into the hole causing an increase in costs due to efforts to retrieve the piece which was successfully done in November 2023. The other job encountered an unusually hard geological formation, and the drilling has taken longer than previously anticipated which required an increase in estimated costs and resulted in the job becoming a loss job for which the Company recorded a 180,000 liability as of September 30, 2023. The increase in total contract drilling costs was partially offset by a decrease in expenses recognized from previously uninstalled materials during the current year period as compared the same period in the prior year. 
 
 At September 30, 2023, there was a backlog of four well drilling and seven pump installation and repair contracts, of which three well drilling and four pump installation and repair contracts were in progress as of September 30, 2023. The backlog of contract drilling revenues as of December 1, 2023 was approximately 6,800,000, of which 6,300,000 is expected to be realized in fiscal 2024 with the remainder to be recognized in the following fiscal year. Based on these contracts in backlog, contract drilling segment operating results for fiscal 2024 is estimated to be relatively similar to fiscal 2023. 
 
 In the quarter ended December 31, 2021, it was determined that a contract drilling segment well completed in the period did not meet the contract specifications for plumbness under a gyroscopic plumbness test which the contract required. While the well did pass the cage plumbness test, the contract uses the gyroscopic test as the measure of plumbness. Barnwell and the customer currently have an arrangement where Barnwell will provide for centralizers, armored cabling and a pump installation and removal test to confirm that plumbness is satisfactory. The pump installation and removal test was successfully completed. Barnwell s management believes the plumbness deviation is not impactful to the performance of the submersible pumps that will be installed in the well. Accordingly, while costs for the centralizers, armored cabling and the pump installation and removal test have been accrued, no accrual has been recorded as of September 30, 2023 for any further costs related to this contract as there is no related probable or estimable contingent liability. 
 
 There has been a significant decrease in demand for water well drilling contracts in recent years that has generally led to increased competition for available contracts and lower margins on awarded contracts. The Company is unable to predict the near-term and long-term availability of water well drilling and pump installation and repair contracts as a result of this volatility in demand. The continuing potential impact of COVID-19 on the health of our contract drilling segment's crew is uncertain, and any work 
 45 

stoppage or discontinuation of contracts currently in backlog due to COVID-19 impacts could result in a material adverse impact to the Company s financial condition and outlook. 
 
 General and administrative expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 1,088,000 (14 to 6,956,000 in fiscal 2023, as compared to 8,044,000 in fiscal 2022. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of 492,000 in share-based compensation expense, 248,000 in bonus expense, 86,000 in bad debt expense, 126,000 in professional fees related to land investment segment proceeds, and 450,000 in fees related to consulting services in the current year period as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by an increase of 495,000 in stockholders costs primarily attributed to the cooperation and support agreement and associated fees to certain directors, as discussed below, in the current year period as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 In January 2023, the Company entered into a cooperation and support agreement (the Cooperation Agreement with Alexander C. Kinzler , the Company s CEO and President in his capacity as a stockholder , MRMP-Managers LLC, the Ned L. Sherwood Revocable Trust, NLS Advisory Group, Inc. and Ned L. Sherwood (collectively, the MRMP Stockholders ), with respect to a potential proxy contest pertaining to the election of directors to our Board of Directors (the Board ). Pursuant to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, among other things, the Company agreed to promptly appoint Joshua S. Horowitz and Laurance Narbut, effective February 9, 2023, to serve on the Board. In addition, the Company agreed to nominate a five-person board comprised of Mr. Kinzler, Kenneth Grossman, Douglas Woodrum, and Messrs. Horowitz and Narbut as candidates for election to the Board at the 2023 Annual Meeting, which was held on April 17, 2023, and the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (the 2024 Annual Meeting and Mr. Kinzler and the MRMP Stockholders agreed to vote their respective shares of common stock of the Company in favor of the election of the Company s slate at the 2023 Annual Meeting and the 2024 Annual Meeting. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, the Company terminated the previously adopted Tax Benefits Preservation Plan. In exchange for this arrangement, the Company agreed to reimburse the MRMP Stockholders and Mr. Kinzler for their reasonable, documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal expenses) in connection with the negotiation and execution of the Cooperation Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and the proposed nomination of directors at the 2023 Annual Meeting. T he Company incurred approximately 351,000 in expenses under the Cooperation Agreement in the year ended September 30, 2023 with respect to such reimbursements to the MRMP Stockholders and Mr. Kinzler. 
 
 In May 2023, the Company s Board of Directors approved and ratified the payment of one-time special director fees to directors Messrs. Grossman and Woodrum for their services on behalf of the Company and the Board pertaining to the negotiations of the Cooperation Agreement and the settlement of the potential proxy contest. Mr. Grossman received a one-time special director fee of 100,000, which was paid in 40,000 cash and a stock grant of 22,728 shares of Barnwell common stock (valued at 60,000 using the closing price of Barnwell's common stock on May 11, 2023, the date of grant). Mr. Woodrum received a one-time special director fee of 50,000, which was paid in 20,000 cash and a stock grant of 11,363 shares of Barnwell common stock (valued at 30,000 using the closing price of Barnwell's common stock on May 11, 2023, the date of grant). 
 
 Depletion, depreciation, and amortization 
 
 Depletion, depreciation, and amortization increased 1,679,000 (60 from 2,778,000 in fiscal 2022 to 4,457,000 in fiscal 2023, due to an increase in the depletion rate for Canadian properties and also 
 46 

new production from those properties and the depletion attributable to production in Texas, partially offset by a decrease in depletion for Oklahoma properties as discussed in the Oil and natural gas section above. 
 
 Impairment of assets 
 
 There was no impairment of assets during the year ended September 30, 2023. In fiscal 2022, the Company determined that the right-of-use asset related to the operating lease for the Lot 4C leasehold land zoned conservation held by Kaupulehu Developments was fully impaired as of September 30, 2022. As a result, the Company recognized an 89,000 right-of-use asset impairment expense in the year ended September 30, 2022. The operating lease terminates in December 2025. 
 
 Foreign currency (gain) loss 
 
 Foreign currency gain was 76,000 during the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to a foreign currency loss of 484,000 during the year ended September 30, 2022 due to the effects of foreign exchange rate changes on intercompany loans and advances as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar. The foreign currency gains and losses from intercompany balances are included in our consolidated statement of operations as the intercompany balances were not considered long-term in nature because management estimates that these intercompany balances will be settled in the future. 
 
 Gain on sale of assets 
 
 In October 2022, the Company completed the sale of a contract drilling segment drilling rig to an independent third party for proceeds of 551,000, net of related costs. The drilling rig was fully depreciated and had a net book value of zero and as a result of the sale, the Company recognized a 551,000 gain during the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Equity in income of affiliates 
 
 Barnwell s investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Barnwell recognized equity in income of affiliates of 758,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to equity in income of affiliates of 3,400,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in partnership income is primarily due to the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships' sale of one lot during the current year period, as compared to six lot sales in the prior year period. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2023, Barnwell received cash distributions of 758,000 from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnership resulting in a net amount of 674,000, after distributing 84,000 to non-controlling interests. During the year ended September 30, 2022, Barnwell received cash distributions of 3,400,000 from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnership resulting in a net amount of 3,028,000, after distributing 372,000 to non-controlling interests. 
 
 In the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Company received cumulative distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships in excess of our investment balance and in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company suspended its equity method earnings recognition and the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnership investment balance was reduced to zero with the distributions received in excess of our investment balance recorded as equity in income of affiliates 
 47 

because the distributions are not refundable by agreement or by law and the Company is not liable for the obligations of or otherwise committed to provide financial support to the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships. The Company will record future equity method earnings only after our share of the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships cumulative earnings in excess of distributions during the suspended period exceeds our share of the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships income recognized for the excess distributions, and during this suspended period any distributions received will be recorded as equity in income of affiliates. Accordingly, the amount of equity in income of affiliates recognized in the year ended September 30, 2023 was equivalent to the 758,000 of distributions received in that period. 
 
 Cumulative distributions received from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships in excess of our investment balance was 708,000 at September 30, 2023 and 958,000 at September 30, 2022. 
 
 Income taxes 
 
 The components of (loss) earnings before income taxes, after adjusting the (loss) earnings for non-controlling interests, are as follows: 
 Year ended September 30, 2023 2022 United States (2,414,000) 739,000 Canada 1,400,000 5,121,000 (1,014,000) 5,860,000 
 
 Barnwell s effective consolidated income tax benefit rate for fiscal 2023, after adjusting loss before income taxes for non-controlling interests, was 5 , as compared to an effective consolidated income tax rate of 6 for fiscal 2022. 
 Consolidated taxes do not bear a customary relationship to pretax results due primarily to the fact that the Company is taxed separately in Canada based on Canadian source operations and in the U.S. based on consolidated operations, and essentially all deferred tax assets, net of relevant offsetting deferred tax liabilities, are not estimated to have a future benefit as tax credits or deductions. The Company operates two subsidiaries in Canada, one of which is a U.S. corporation operating as a branch in Canada that is treated as a non-resident for Canadian tax purposes and thus has operating results that cannot be offset against or combined with the other Canadian subsidiary that files as a resident for Canadian tax purposes. Income from our non-controlling interest in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is treated as non-unitary for state of Hawaii unitary filing purposes, thus unitary Hawaii losses provide limited sheltering of such non-unitary income. Income from our investment in the Oklahoma oil venture is 100 allocable to Oklahoma. As such, Barnwell receives no benefit from consolidated or unitary losses and, therefore, is subject to Oklahoma state taxes. Consolidated taxes also include the impacts of favorable state jurisdiction provision to tax return true-ups. Our operations in Texas are subject to a franchise tax assessed by the state of Texas, however no significant amounts have been incurred to date. 
 In addition, Canadian jurisdiction net operating loss carryforwards, the benefit of which had not previously been recognized due to the Company's continuing full valuation allowance, were partially utilized in that jurisdiction in the current year. The net operating loss carryforwards beyond the current year s utilization continue to have a full valuation allowance as realization of their benefit is not more likely than not. 
 48 

Included in the current income tax provision for the year ended September 30, 2022 is a 62,000 expense for income tax penalties and interest thereon for the non-filing of IRS Form 8858 in each of our U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021. The Company prepared amended U.S. federal tax returns for each of these years to include Form 8858 and a statement of reasonable cause. The amended returns were filed in September and October 2023 and the Company requested abatement of any potential penalties and interest which could subsequently be assessed. The Company is awaiting a response from the IRS and the probability of success of the abatement request remains uncertain. No additional expenses related to the potential penalties and interest were included in the current income tax provision for the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests 
 Earnings and losses attributable to non-controlling interests represent the non-controlling interests share of revenues and expenses related to the various partnerships and joint ventures in which Barnwell has controlling interests and consolidates. 
 
 Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests totaled 150,000 in fiscal 2023, as compared to net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests of 659,000 in fiscal 2022. The 509,000 (77 decrease is primarily due to decreases in the amount of equity in income of affiliates and percentage of sales revenue received in the current year period as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 The effect of inflation on Barnwell has generally been to increase its cost of operations, general and administrative costs and direct costs associated with oil and natural gas production and contract drilling operations. Oil and natural gas prices realized by Barnwell are essentially determined by world prices for oil and western Canadian/Midwestern U.S. prices for natural gas. 
 
 Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards on Future Filings 
 
 In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the incurred loss model with an expected loss model referred to as the current expected credit loss CECL model. The CECL model is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, including but not limited to trade receivables. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those annual periods. The FASB has subsequently issued other related ASUs which amend ASU 2016-13 to provide clarification and additional guidance. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on Barnwell s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Barnwell s primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow generated by operations, and land investment segment proceeds. At September 30, 2023, Barnwell had 2,487,000 in working capital. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 1,943,000 for fiscal 2023, as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of 7,291,000 for the same period in fiscal 2022. This 5,348,000 change in operating cash flows was due to significantly lower operating results for the oil and 
 49 

natural gas segment in the current year period as compared to the prior year period. Additionally, the change was also due to a decrease in distributions of income from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships in the current year period as compared to the prior year period and fluctuations in working capital. 
 
 Cash flows used in investing activities totaled 11,180,000 for fiscal 2023, as compared to cash flows used in investing activities of 7,112,000 for fiscal 2022. This 4,068,000 change in investing cash flows was due to an increase of 2,697,000 in cash paid for oil and natural gas capital expenditures, a decrease of 904,000 in proceeds from the sale of interest in leasehold land, net of costs paid, and a decrease of 1,741,000 in proceeds related to the sale of assets in the current year period as compared to same period in the prior year, partially offset by a 1,563,000 decrease in payments to acquire oil and natural gas properties in the current year period as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Cash flows used in financing activities totaled 786,000 for fiscal 2023, as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of 1,560,000 for fiscal 2022. The 2,346,000 change in financing cash flows was due to a 450,000 increase in payment of dividends and a 2,356,000 decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of costs, related to the Company's at-the-market offering in the prior year period, partially offset by a 490,000 decrease in distributions to non-controlling interests in the current year period as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Cash Dividends 
 
 The following table sets forth the cash dividends paid per share of common stock during fiscal 2023 and 2022. 
 
 Record Date Date of Payment Dividend Paid August 24, 2023 September 11, 2023 0.015 May 25, 2023 June 12, 2023 0.015 February 23, 2023 March 13, 2023 0.015 December 27, 2022 January 11, 2023 0.015 August 23, 2022 September 6, 2022 0.015 
 
 Canada Emergency Business Account Loan 
 
 In the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the Company s Canadian subsidiary, Barnwell of Canada, received an interest-free loan of CAD 40,000 (in Canadian dollars) under the Canada Emergency Business Account CEBA loan program for small businesses. In the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the Company applied for an increase to our CEBA loan and received an additional CAD 20,000 for a total loan amount received of CAD 60,000 45,000) under the program. The CEBA loan was interest-free with no principal payments required until December 31, 2023 and if the Company repaid 66.7 of the principal amount prior to December 31, 2023, 33.3 of the loan would be forgiven. 
 
 In September 2023, the Company repaid the loan balance of CAD 40,000 and the remaining loan balance of CAD 20,000 was forgiven per the terms of the CEBA loan agreement. Accordingly, as a result of the loan forgiveness, the Company recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of 15,000 during the year ended September 30, 2023, which was included in the Gas processing and other line item in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 50 

At The Market Offering 
 
 On March 16, 2021, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners A.G.P, ), with respect to an at-the-market offering program ATM pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock, par value 0.50 per share, having an aggregate sales price of up to 25 million (subject to certain limitations set forth in the Sales Agreement and applicable securities laws, rules and regulations), through or to A.G.P as the Company s sales agent or as principal. Sales of our common stock under the ATM, if any, will be made by any methods deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the NYSE American, on any other existing trading market for our Common Stock, or to or through a market maker. Shares of common stock sold under the ATM are offered pursuant to the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-254365), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 16, 2021, and declared effective on March 26, 2021 (the "Registration Statement ), and the prospectus dated March 26, 2021, included in the Registration Statement. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company sold 509,467 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of 2,356,000 after commissions and fees of 75,000 and ATM-related professional services of 22,000. In August 2022, the Company s Board of Directors suspended the sales of our common stock under the ATM until further notice. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Capital Expenditures 
 
 Barnwell s oil and natural gas capital expenditures, including accrued capital expenditures and acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and excluding additions and revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations, decreased 323,000 from 11,052,000 in fiscal 2022 to 10,729,000 in fiscal 2023. 
 
 In December 2022, Barnwell Texas, LLC Barnwell Texas ), a new wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a purchase and sale agreement with an independent third party whereby Barnwell Texas acquired a 22.3 non-operated working interest in oil and natural gas leasehold acreage in the Permian Basin in Texas for cash consideration of 806,000. In connection with the purchase of such leasehold interests, Barnwell Texas acquired a 15.4 non-operated working interest in two oil wells in the Wolfcamp Formation in Loving and Ward Counties, Texas and has paid 4,293,000 for its share of the costs to drill, complete and equip the wells during the year ended September 30, 2023. The two gross (0.3 net) non-operated wells began producing in late April 2023 and the Company s share of net production from these wells totaled 12,000 barrels of oil, 12,000 barrels of natural gas liquids, and 121,000 Mcf of natural gas during the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 In the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Company participated in the drilling of three gross (0.9 net) non-operated wells in the Twining area of Alberta, Canada. All three wells were completed and began producing during the latter part of the three months ended June 30, 2023. Capital expenditures incurred for the drilling of these wells and Twining facilities during the year ended September 30, 2023 totaled approximately 4,770,000. 
 
 In fiscal 2022, the Company participated in the drilling of six gross (1.7 net) non-operated wells in the Twining area. Capital expenditures incurred by the Company for these non-operated wells totaled 4,366,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Additionally, the Company drilled one gross (1.0 net) 
 51 

operated well in the Twining area and capital expenditures incurred by the Company for this well was 2,852,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Property Acquisitions and Dispositions 
 
 Fiscal 2022 
 
 In the quarter ended December 31, 2021, Barnwell acquired working interests in oil and natural gas properties located in the Twining area of Alberta, Canada, for cash consideration of 317,000. 
 
 In the quarter ended March 31, 2022, Barnwell acquired additional working interests in oil and natural gas properties located in the Twining area of Alberta, Canada for consideration of 1,246,000. The purchase price per the agreement was adjusted for customary purchase price adjustments to reflect the economic activity from the effective date to the closing date. Barnwell also assumed 1,500,000 in asset retirement obligations associated with the acquisition. 
 
 There were no significant oil and natural gas property dispositions during the year ended September 30, 2022. The 503,000 of proceeds from sale of oil and natural gas properties included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily represents the refund of income taxes previously withheld from what otherwise would have been proceeds on fiscal 2021 s oil and natural gas property sales. 
 
 Asset Retirement Obligation 
 
 In September 2019, the AER issued an abandonment/closure order for all wells and facilities in the Manyberries area which had been largely operated by LGX, an operating company that went into receivership in 2016. The estimated asset retirement obligation for the Company's interest in the wells and facilities in the Manyberries area is included in Asset retirement obligation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 After the abandonment/closure order was issued for Manyberries, the OWA created a WIP program for specific areas where there are a significant number of orphaned wells to abandon. The OWA has the ability and expertise to abandon wells using its internal resources and network of service providers resulting in efficiencies that companies such as Barnwell would not be able to obtain on its own. Under the WIP program, the Company would be required to provide payment for only Barnwell s working interest share, however, all WIP s would have to participate in the program for the OWA to begin its work. In March 2021, the Company was notified by the OWA that Barnwell s Manyberries wells were confirmed to be in the WIP program. 
 
 Under the agreement with the OWA, the Company is required to pay the abandonment and reclamation costs in advance through a cash deposit. The total cash deposit amount was calculated to be approximately 1,525,000 and the Company paid 888,000 of the total deposit in July and August 2021 and may need to pay the remaining balance of 637,000 by August 2024. The Company revised its Manyberries ARO liability based on the OWA s revised abandonment and reclamation estimates. Based on a review of the details of the cash deposit calculation provided by the OWA, which includes amounts added for possible contingencies, the Company believes the required cash deposit amount by the OWA is higher than the actual costs of the asset retirement obligation for the Manyberries wells and that any excess of the deposit over actual asset retirement costs for the first phase of the work would be credited toward the second phase of the work. A remaining excess deposit, if any, would ultimately be refunded to 
 52 

the Company upon completion of all of the work. As at September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a cumulative reduction in the deposit balance of 300,000 for work performed under this program.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Stockholders and Board of Directors of 
 Barnwell Industries, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Barnwell Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

 Estimation of proved reserves impacting the recognition and valuation of depletion expense and impairment of oil and gas properties 
 
 Critical Accounting Matter Description 
 As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company accounts for its oil and gas properties using the full cost method of accounting which requires management to make estimates of proved reserve volumes and future revenues and expenses to calculate depletion expense and measure its oil and gas properties for potential impairment. To estimate the volume of proved reserves and future revenues, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasting the production decline rate of producing properties and forecasting the timing and volume of production associated with the Company s development plan for proved undeveloped properties. In addition, the estimation of proved reserves is also impacted by management s judgments and estimates regarding the financial performance of wells associated with proved reserves to determine if wells are expected, with reasonable certainty, to be economical under the appropriate pricing assumptions required in the estimation of depletion expense and potential impairment measurements. We identified the estimation of proved reserves of oil and gas properties, due to its impact on depletion expense and impairment evaluation, as a critical audit matter. 
 
 The principal consideration for our determination that the estimation of proved reserves is a critical audit matter is that changes in certain inputs and assumptions, which require a high degree of subjectivity necessary to estimate the volume and future revenues of the Company s proved reserves could have a significant impact on the measurement of depletion expense or the impairment assessment. In turn, auditing those inputs and assumptions required subjective and complex auditor judgement. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 
 We obtained an understanding of the design and implementation of management s controls and our audit procedures related to the estimation of proved reserves included the following, among others. 
 
 We evaluated the level of knowledge, skill, and ability of the Company s reservoir engineering specialists and their relationship to the Company, made inquiries of those reservoir engineers regarding the process followed and judgments made to estimate the Company s proved reserve volumes, and read the reserve report prepared by the Company s specialists. 
 To the extent key, sensitive inputs and assumptions used to determine proved reserve volumes and other cash flow inputs and assumptions are derived from Company s accounting records, such as commodity pricing, historical pricing differentials, operating costs, and working and net revenue interests, we tested management s process for determining the assumptions, including examining the underlying support, on a sample basis. Specifically, our audit procedures involved testing management s assumptions, to the extent key, as follows: 
 Compared the estimated pricing differentials used in the reserve report to realized prices related to revenue transactions recorded in the current year and examined contractual support for the pricing differentials; 
 Evaluated the forecasted operating costs at year-end compared to historical operating costs; 
 Evaluated the working and net revenue interests used in the reserve report by inspecting a sample of ownership interests; 
 Evaluated the Company s evidence supporting the amount of proved undeveloped properties reflected in the reserve report by examining support for the Company s or the operator s ability and intent to develop the proved undeveloped properties; 
 55 

Applied analytical procedures to the reserve report by comparing to historical actual results and to the prior year reserve report. 
 
 Revenue recognition based on the percentage of completion method 
 
 Critical Accounting Matter Description 
 As described further in Note 1 to the financial statements, revenues derived from contract drilling contracts are recognized over time, as performance obligations are satisfied, due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer, using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost. Revenue recognition under this method is judgmental, particularly on lump-sum contracts, as it requires the Company to prepare estimates of total contract revenue and total contract costs, including costs to complete in-process contracts. 
 
 Auditing the Company s estimates or total contract revenue and costs used to recognize revenue on contract drilling contracts involved significant auditor judgment, as it required the evaluation of subjective factors such as assumptions related to project schedule and completion, forecasted labor, and material and subcontract costs. These assumptions involved significant management judgment, which affects the measurement of revenue recognized by the Company. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 
 We obtained an understanding of the design and implementation of management s controls and our audit procedures related to the estimation of proved reserves included the following, among others. 
 
 We obtained an understanding of the Company s estimation process that affected revenue recognized on engineering and construction contracts. This included controls over management s monitoring and review of project costs, including the Company s procedures to validate the completeness and accuracy of data used to determine the estimates; 
 We selected a sample of projects and, among other procedures, obtained and inspected the contract agreements, amendments and change orders to test the existence of customer arrangements and understand the scope of pricing of the related contracts; 
 Evaluated the Company s estimated revenue and costs to complete by obtaining and analyzing supporting documentation of management s estimates of variable consideration and contract costs; 
 Compared contract profitability estimates in the current year to historical estimates and actual performance.

1. 
 -owned land investment general partnership (Kaupulehu Developments), a -owned land investment partnership (KD Kona), and a variable interest entity (Teton Barnwell Fund I, LLC) for which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

62 

principal business segments: 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Segment - Barnwell engages in oil and natural gas development, production, acquisitions and sales in Canada and the U.S. 
 
 Land Investment Segment - Barnwell invests in land interests in Hawaii. 
 
 Contract Drilling Segment - Barnwell provides well drilling services and water pumping system installation and repairs in Hawaii. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas - Barnwell s investments in oil and natural gas properties are located in Alberta, Canada, Oklahoma, and Texas. These property interests are principally held under governmental leases or licenses. Barnwell sells the large majority of its oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production under short-term contracts between itself and marketers based on prices indexed to market prices and recognizes revenue at a point in time when the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are delivered, as this is where Barnwell s performance obligation is satisfied and title has passed to the customer. 
 
 Land Investment - Barnwell is entitled to receive contingent residual payments from the entities that previously purchased Barnwell s land investment interests under contracts entered into in prior years. The residual payments under those contracts become due when the entities sell lots and/or residential units in the areas that were previously sold under the aforementioned contracts or when a preferred payment threshold is achieved. The residual payments received by Barnwell are recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. 
 
 Contract Drilling - Through contracts which are normally less than twelve months in duration, Barnwell drills water and water monitoring wells and installs and repairs water pumping systems in Hawaii. Barnwell recognizes revenue from well drilling or the installation of pumps over time based on total costs incurred on the projects relative to the total expected costs to satisfy the performance obligation as management believes this is an accurate representation of the percentage of completion as control is continuously transferred to the customer. Uninstalled materials, which typically consists of well casing or pumps, are excluded in the costs-to-costs calculation for the duration of the contract as including these costs would result in a distortion of progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation due to the resulting cumulative catch-up in margin in a single period. An equal amount of cost and revenue is recorded when uninstalled materials are controlled by the customer, which is typically when Barnwell has the right to payment for the materials and when the materials are delivered to the customer s site or location and such materials have been accepted by the customer. Uninstalled materials are held in inventory and included in Other current assets on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets until control is transferred to the customer. When the estimate on a contract indicates a loss, Barnwell records the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known. 
 
 The contract price may include variable consideration, which includes such items as increases to the transaction price for unapproved change orders and claims for which price has not yet been agreed by the customer. The Company estimates variable consideration using either the most likely amount or expected value method, whichever is a more appropriate reflection of the amount to which it expects to be entitled based on the characteristics and circumstances of the contract. Variable consideration is included

to ownership interest and does not control, are accounted for as equity method investments. Equity method investment adjustments include Barnwell s proportionate share of investee income or loss, adjustments to recognize certain differences between Barnwell s carrying value and Barnwell s equity in net assets of the investee at the date of investment, impairments and other adjustments required by the equity method. Gains or losses are realized when such investments are sold. Barnwell classifies distributions received from equity method investments using the cumulative earnings approach in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Under the cumulative earnings approach, distributions received up to the amount of cumulative equity in earnings recognized are treated as returns on investment and are classified within operating cash flows and those in excess of that amount are treated as returns of investment and are classified within investing cash flows.

), using average first-day-of-the-month prices during the 12-month period ending as of the balance sheet date held constant over the life of the reserves, of Barnwell s estimated future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and natural gas reserves as determined by independent petroleum reserve engineers, less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves but excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations with the exception of those associated with proved undeveloped reserves from wells that are to be drilled in the future; plus 2) the cost of major development projects and unproven properties not subject to depletion, if any; plus 3) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in costs subject to depletion; less 4) related income tax effects. If net capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is expensed. Depletion is computed using the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs, net of estimated salvage values, plus estimated future costs to develop proved reserves and satisfy asset retirement obligations, are amortized over the total estimated proved reserves on a country-by-country basis. Investments in major development projects are not depleted until either proved reserves are associated with the projects or impairment has been determined. Proceeds from the disposition of oil and natural gas properties are credited to the full cost pool, with no gain or loss recognized, unless such a sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and the proved reserves in a particular country. 
 
 Given the volatility of oil and gas prices, it is reasonably possible that the estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term. If oil and gas prices decline in the future, even if only for a short period of time, it is possible that impairments of oil and gas properties could occur. In addition, it is reasonably possible that impairments could occur if costs are incurred in excess of any increases in the present value of future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, or if properties are sold for proceeds less than the discounted present value of the related proved oil and gas reserves. 
 
 Barnwell s sales reflect its working interest share after royalties. Barnwell s production is generally delivered and sold at the plant gate. Barnwell does not have transportation volume commitments with pipelines and does not have natural gas imbalances related to natural gas balancing arrangements with its partners.

The Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships own certain real estate and development rights interests in the Kukio, Maniniowali and Kaupulehu portions of Kukio Resort, a private residential community on the Kona coast of the island of Hawaii, as well as Kukio Resort s real estate sales office operations. KDK holds interests in KD I and KD II. KD I is the developer of Increment I and KD II is the developer of Increment II. Barnwell's ownership interests in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 
 
 In March 2019, KD II admitted a new development partner, Replay, a party unrelated to Barnwell, in an effort to move forward with development of the remainder of Increment II at Kaupulehu. KDK and Replay hold ownership interests of and , respectively, of KD II and Barnwell has a indirect non-controlling ownership interest in KD II through KDK, which is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Barnwell continues to have an indirect non-controlling ownership interest in KD Kukio Resorts, KD Maniniowali, and KD I. 
 
 The partnerships derive income from the sale of residential parcels in Increment I, of which only lots remain to be sold as of September 30, 2023, as well as from commissions on real estate sales by the real estate sales office and revenues resulting from the sale of private club memberships. 
 
 Increment II is not yet under development, and there is no assurance that development of such acreage will in fact occur. No definitive development plans have been made by the developer of Increment II as of the date of this report.

 Gross profit Net earnings 
 
 In the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Company received cumulative distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships in excess of our investment balance and in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company suspended its equity method earnings recognition and the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnership investment balance was reduced to with the distributions received in excess of our investment balance recorded as equity in income of affiliates because the distributions are not refundable by agreement or by law and the Company is not liable for the obligations of or otherwise committed to provide financial support to the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships. The Company will record future equity method earnings only after our share of the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnership s cumulative earnings in excess of distributions during the suspended period exceeds our share of the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnership s income recognized for the excess distributions, and during this suspended period any distributions received will be recorded as equity in income of affiliates. Accordingly, the amount of equity in income of affiliates recognized in the year ended September 30, 2023 was equivalent to the of distributions received in that period. 
 
 Cumulative distributions received from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships in excess of our investment balance was at September 30, 2023 and at September 30, 2022. 
 
 Sale of Interest in Leasehold Land 
 
 Kaupulehu Developments has the right to receive payments from KD I and KD II resulting from the sale of lots and/or residential units within Increment I and Increment II by KD I and KD II (see Note 19). 
 
 With respect to Increment I, Kaupulehu Developments is entitled to receive payments from KD I based on of the gross receipts from KD I s sales of single-family residential lots in Increment I. single-family lot was sold during the year ended September 30, 2023 and single-family lots, of the 
 73 

of the distributions of KD II, the cost of which is to be solely borne by KDK out of its ownership interest in KD II, plus a priority payout of of KDK s cumulative net profits derived from Increment II sales subsequent to Phase 2A, up to a maximum of as to the priority payout. Such interests are limited to distributions or net profits interests and Barnwell does not have any partnership interests in KD II or KDK through its interest in Kaupulehu Developments. The arrangement also gives Barnwell rights to single-family residential lots in Phase 2A of Increment II, and single-family residential lots in phases subsequent to Phase 2A when such lots are developed by KD II, all at no cost to Barnwell. Barnwell is committed to commence construction of improvements within days of the transfer of the lots in the phases subsequent to Phase 2A as a condition of the transfer of such lots. Also, in addition to Barnwell s existing obligations to pay professional fees to certain parties based on percentages of its gross receipts, Kaupulehu Developments is also obligated to pay an amount equal to and of the cumulative net profits of KD II to KD Development and a pool of various individuals, respectively, all of whom are partners of KKM and are unrelated to Barnwell, in compensation for the agreement of these parties to admit the new development partner for Increment II. Such compensation will be reflected as the obligation becomes probable and the amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. 
 
 Fees - included in general and administrative expenses ) ) Sale of interest in leasehold land, net of fees paid 
 
 There is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future payments from Increment I or Increment II to be received, or that the remaining acreage within Increment II will be developed. No definitive development plans have been made by KD II, the developer of Increment II, as of the date of this report. 
 
 Investment in Leasehold Land Interest Lot 4C 
 
 Kaupulehu Developments holds an interest in an area of approximately acres of vacant leasehold land zoned conservation located adjacent to Lot 4A, which currently has no development potential without both a development agreement with the lessor and zoning reclassification. The lease terminates in December 2025.

BOK is responsible for of the capital contributions made to Teton Barnwell. 
 
 The Company has determined that Teton Barnwell is a variable interest entity VIE as the entity is structured with non-substantive voting rights and that the Company is the primary beneficiary. This is due to the fact that even though Teton Barnwell has a unanimous consent voting structure, BOK is responsible for of the capital contributions required to fund Teton Barnwell s future oil exploration and development investments pursuant to the Teton Operating Agreement and thus, BOK has the power to steer the decisions that most significantly impact Teton Barnwell s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb any potential losses that could be significant to Teton Barnwell. As BOK is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, Teton Barnwell s operating results, assets and liabilities are consolidated by the Company.

 non-operated working interest in oil and natural gas leasehold acreage in the Permian Basin in Texas for cash consideration of . In connection with the purchase of such leasehold interests, Barnwell Texas acquired a non-operated working interest in two oil wells in the Wolfcamp Formation in Loving and Ward Counties, Texas and has paid for its share of the costs to drill, complete and equip the wells during the year ended September 30, 2023. The two Texas wells began producing in late April 2023. Additionally, in connection with the entry into this agreement, the Company was obligated to pay a broker s fee of of the capital invested under this arrangement, which expired in November 2023, to Four Pines Exploration LLC - Exploration - Series 1 Four Pines ). Four Pines is controlled by Mr. Colin O Farrell who is an affiliate of Teton Barnwell (see Note 19 for additional details). As of September 30, 2023, the Company has paid in broker fees to Four Pines related to this arrangement. 
 
 Fiscal 2022 Acquisitions and Dispositions 
 
 In the quarter ended December 31, 2021, Barnwell acquired working interests in oil and natural gas properties located in the Twining area of Alberta, Canada, for cash consideration of . 
 
 In the quarter ended March 31, 2022, Barnwell acquired additional working interests in oil and natural gas properties located in the Twining area of Alberta, Canada for consideration of . The purchase price per the agreement was adjusted for customary purchase price adjustments to reflect the economic activity from the effective date to the closing date. Barnwell also assumed in asset retirement obligations associated with the acquisition. 
 
 There were no significant oil and natural gas property dispositions during the year ended September 30, 2022. The of proceeds from sale of oil and natural gas properties included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily represents the refund of income taxes previously withheld from what otherwise would have been proceeds on fiscal 2021 s oil and natural gas property sales.

 Asset retirement obligations were reduced by and in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, for those obligations that were assumed by purchasers of Barnwell's oil and natural gas properties. Asset retirement obligations increased by and in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily due to upward revisions from acceleration in the estimated timing of future abandonments as a result of changes in the estimated economic lives and costs of certain wells due to updated information received and changes in management's discretionary timing of abandonment projects due to an increase in estimated funds available. Asset retirement obligations also increased by and in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, due primarily to our wells drilled and acquisitions (see Note 6 for additional details on acquisitions). The asset retirement obligation reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with Barnwell's oil and natural gas properties. Barnwell estimates the ultimate productive life of the properties, a credit-adjusted risk-free rate, and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation. The credit-adjusted risk-free rate for the entire asset retirement obligation is a blended rate which ranges from to . 
 
 In September 2019, the AER issued an abandonment/closure order for all wells and facilities in the Manyberries area which had been largely operated by LGX, an operating company that went into receivership in 2016. The estimated asset retirement obligation for the Company's interest in the wells and facilities in the Manyberries area is included in Asset retirement obligation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 After the abandonment/closure order was issued for Manyberries, the OWA created a WIP program for specific areas where there are a significant number of orphaned wells to abandon. The OWA has the ability and expertise to abandon wells using its internal resources and network of service providers resulting in efficiencies that companies such as Barnwell would not be able to obtain on its own. Under the WIP program, the Company would be required to provide payment for only Barnwell s working interest share, however, all WIP s would have to participate in the program for the OWA to begin its work. In March 2021, the Company was notified by the OWA that Barnwell s Manyberries wells were confirmed to be in the WIP program. 
 
 78 

and the Company paid of the total deposit in July and August 2021 and may need to pay the remaining balance of by August 2024. The Company revised its Manyberries ARO liability based on the OWA s revised abandonment and reclamation estimates. Based on a review of the details of the cash deposit calculation provided by the OWA, which includes amounts added for possible contingencies, the Company believes the required cash deposit amount by the OWA is higher than the actual costs of the asset retirement obligation for the Manyberries wells and that any excess of the deposit over actual asset retirement costs for the first phase of the work would be credited toward the second phase of the work. A remaining excess deposit, if any, would ultimately be refunded to the Company upon completion of all of the work. As of September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a cumulative reduction in the deposit balance of for work performed under this program.

 years average earnings. Barnwell s funding policy is intended to provide for both benefits attributed to service to date and for those expected to be earned in the future. In addition, Barnwell sponsors a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP ), a noncontributory supplemental retirement benefit plan which covers certain current and former employees of Barnwell for amounts exceeding the limits allowed under the Pension Plan. Effective December 31, 2019, the accrual of benefits for all participants in the Pension Plan and SERP was frozen and the plans were closed to new participants from that point forward.

 Currently, contributions are planned to be made to the Pension Plan during fiscal 2024. The SERP plan is unfunded and Barnwell funds benefits when payments are made. Expected payments under the SERP for fiscal 2024 is not material. Fluctuations in actual market returns as well as changes in general interest rates will result in changes in the market value of plan assets and may result in increased or decreased retirement benefits costs and contributions in future periods. 
 
 The Pension Plan actuarial gains in fiscal 2023 were primarily due to an increase in the discount rate and actual investment returns that were greater than the assumed rate of return. The SERP actuarial gains in fiscal 2023 were primarily due to an increase in the discount rate. 
 
 The Pension Plan actuarial gains in fiscal 2022 were primarily due to an increase in the discount rate, partially offset by an actuarial loss resulting from actual investment returns that were less than the assumed rate of return. The SERP actuarial gains in fiscal 2022 were primarily due to an increase in the discount rate.

 Plan Assets 
 
 Management communicates periodically with its professional investment advisors to establish investment policies, direct investments and select investment options. The overall investment objective of the Pension Plan is to attain a diversified combination of investments that provides long-term growth in the assets of the plan to fund future benefit obligations while managing risk in order to meet current

Actual investment allocations may vary from our target allocations from time to time due to prevailing market conditions. We periodically review our actual investment allocations and rebalance our investments to our target allocations as dictated by current and anticipated market conditions and required cash flows. 
 
 We categorize plan assets into three levels based upon the assumptions used to price the assets. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level 3 requires significant management judgment in determining the fair value. Equity securities and exchange-traded funds are valued by obtaining quoted prices on recognized and highly liquid exchanges. Fixed income securities are valued based upon the closing price reported in the active market in which the security is traded. All of our plan assets are categorized as Level 1 assets, and as such, the actual market value is used to determine the fair value of assets.

 Consolidated taxes do not bear a customary relationship to pretax results due primarily to the fact that the Company is taxed separately in Canada based on Canadian source operations and in the U.S. based on consolidated operations, and essentially all deferred tax assets, net of relevant offsetting deferred tax liabilities, are not estimated to have a future benefit as tax credits or deductions. The Company operates two subsidiaries in Canada, one of which is a U.S. corporation operating as a branch in Canada that is treated as a non-resident for Canadian tax purposes and thus has operating results that cannot be offset against or combined with the other Canadian subsidiary that files as a resident for Canadian tax purposes. Income from our non-controlling interest in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is treated as non-unitary for state of Hawaii unitary filing purposes, thus unitary Hawaii losses provide limited sheltering of such non-unitary income. Income from our investment in the Oklahoma oil venture is 100 allocable to Oklahoma. As such, Barnwell receives no benefit from consolidated or unitary losses and, therefore, is subject to Oklahoma state taxes. Consolidated taxes also include the impacts of favorable state jurisdiction provision to tax return true-ups. Our operations in Texas are subject to a franchise tax assessed by the state of Texas, however no significant amounts have been incurred to date. 
 In addition, Canadian jurisdiction net operating loss carryforwards, the benefit of which had not previously been recognized due to the Company's continuing full valuation allowance, were partially utilized in that jurisdiction in the current year. The net operating loss carryforwards beyond the current year s utilization continue to have a full valuation allowance as realization of their benefit is not more likely than not. 
 Included in the current income tax provision for the year ended September 30, 2022 is a expense for income tax penalties and interest thereon for the non-filing of IRS Form 8858 in each of our U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021. The Company prepared amended U.S. federal tax returns for each of these years to include Form 8858 and a statement of reasonable cause. The amended returns were filed in September and October 2023 and the Company requested abatement of

 The U.S. state provision to tax return adjustments in the table above was treated as a separate item in fiscal 2023 due to the significance of its impact on the fiscal 2023 reconciliation, and the corresponding fiscal 2022 amount was reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The reclassification had no impact on previously reported net earnings, cash flows, total assets, or stockholders' equity. Additionally, the changes in the valuation allowance shown in the table above exclude the impact of changes in the valuation allowance of items that are incorporated within the respective reconciliation line items elsewhere in the table.

for the year ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to current fiscal year operational activity that resulted in changes in deferred tax asset and liability balances, and there were no changes in judgment about the realizability of related deferred tax assets in future years. Of the total net decrease in the valuation allowance for fiscal 2023, was recognized as an income tax benefit and was credited to accumulated other comprehensive income. 
 
 Net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2023 of consists of the portion of deferred tax assets that are estimated to be partially realized through corresponding concurrent reversals of deferred tax liabilities related to the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships' excess of book income over taxable income, the book basis of property and equipment in excess of tax basis, foreign branch deferred taxes, retirement plan assets accrued for books but not for tax under U.S. tax law, and certain other minor deferred tax liabilities. 
 
 At September 30, 2023, Barnwell had U.S. federal foreign tax credit carryovers, U.S. federal net operating loss carryovers, U.S. state net operating loss carryovers and Canadian net operating loss carryovers totaling , , and , respectively. All four items were fully offset by valuation allowances at September 30, 2023. The U.S. federal net operating loss carryovers generated through September 30, 2018 expire in fiscal years 2032-2038, the U.S. state unitary net operating loss carryovers generated through September 30, 2017 expire in fiscal years 2033-2037, the Canadian net operating loss carryovers expire in fiscal years 2039-2043, and the foreign tax credit carryovers expire in fiscal years 2024-2025. The U.S. federal net operating loss carryovers generated in fiscal years 2019-2023 and the U.S. state net operating loss carryovers generated in fiscal years 2018-2023 have no expiry, however utilization of the U.S. state and U.S. federal net operating loss carryovers generated in these and future years are limited to 80 of taxable income. 
 
 FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, prescribes a threshold for recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. 
 
 Barnwell files U.S. federal income tax returns, income tax returns in various U.S. states, and Canadian federal and provincial tax returns. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is audited and finally resolved. We believe that our unrecognized tax benefits are reflected on a more likely than not basis. We evaluate uncertain tax positions based on ongoing facts and circumstances. Any change in judgment related to the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions is recognized in earnings in the period in which such change occurs. Interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as a component of income tax expense. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash. Favorable resolution for an amount less than the amount estimated by Barnwell would be recognized as a decrease in the effective income tax rate in the period of resolution, and unfavorable resolution in excess of the amount estimated

Effect of tax positions taken in prior years Accrued interest related to tax positions taken Balance at end of year 
 Uncertain tax positions at September 30, 2023 are related to the potential assessment of penalties and interest for the failure to file a certain foreign information form with each of our U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021. The Company filed amended U.S. federal income tax returns which included the missing form and statement of reasonable cause for these years in September and October 2023 and requested abatement of any potential penalties and interest which could subsequently be assessed. The Company is awaiting a response from the IRS and the probability of success of the abatement request remains uncertain.

Contract assets Contract liabilities 
 
 Accounts receivables from contracts with customers are included in Accounts and other receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and contract assets, which includes costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings and retainage, are included in Other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract liabilities, which includes billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings are included in Other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Retainage, included in contract assets, represents amounts due from customers, but where payments are withheld contractually until certain construction milestones are met. Amounts retained typically range from to of the total invoice, up to contractually-specified maximums. The Company classifies as a current asset those retainages that are expected to be collected in the next twelve months. 
 
 Contract assets represent the Company s rights to consideration in exchange for services transferred to a customer that have not been billed as of the reporting date. The Company s rights are generally unconditional at the time its performance obligations are satisfied. 
 
 When the Company receives consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a sales contract, the Company records deferred revenue, which represents a contract liability. Such deferred revenue typically results from billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had and , respectively, included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for those performance obligations expected to be completed in the next twelve months. 
 
 During the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the amount of revenue recognized that was previously included in contract liabilities as of the beginning of the respective period was and , respectively. 
 
 Contracts are sometimes modified for a change in scope or other requirements. The Company considers contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Most of the Company s contract modifications are for goods and services that are not distinct from the existing performance obligations. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price, and the measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase or decrease) on a cumulative catchup basis.

 Contract Fulfillment Costs 
 
 Preconstruction costs, which include costs such as set-up and mobilization, are capitalized and allocated across all performance obligations and deferred and amortized over the contract term on a progress towards completion basis. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had and , respectively, in unamortized preconstruction costs related to contracts that were not completed. During the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the amortization of preconstruction costs related to contracts was and , respectively. These amounts have been included in Contract drilling operating costs and expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, impairment charges in connection with the Company s preconstruction costs were recorded during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 Uninstalled Materials 
 
 Uninstalled materials, which typically consists of well casing or pumps, are excluded in the costs-to-costs calculation for the duration of the contract as including these costs would result in a distortion of progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation due to the resulting cumulative catch-up in margin in a single period. An equal amount of cost and revenue is recorded when uninstalled materials are controlled by the customer, which is typically when Barnwell has the right to payment for the materials and when the materials are delivered to the customer s site or location and such materials have been accepted by the customer. As of of September 30, 2023 and 2022, uninstalled materials was and , respectively. Uninstalled materials are held in inventory and included in Other current assets on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to Barnwell, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify Barnwell s financial reports and to other members of executive management and the Board of Directors. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, an evaluation was carried out by Barnwell s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of Barnwell s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that Barnwell s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) were effective as of September 30, 2023 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Barnwell in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder. 
 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Barnwell s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Barnwell, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of Barnwell s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Barnwell conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting using criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) (the COSO Framework ). Based on this evaluation under the COSO Framework, management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Pursuant to Item 308(b) of Regulation S-K, management s report is not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm because the Company is neither an accelerated filer nor a large accelerated filer as those terms are defined by the SEC. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 Provisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware Law

 We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, an anti-takeover law. In general, this section prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination or the transaction in which such person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Generally, an interested stockholder is a person that, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status did own, 15 or more of a corporation s voting stock. The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of our common stock.

 CLAWBACK POLICY 
 Introduction 
 The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to create and maintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and that reinforces the Company's pay-for-performance compensation philosophy. The Board has therefore adopted this policy which provides for the recoupment of certain executive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws (the Policy ). This Policy is designed to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act and Section 811 of the NYSE American LLC Company Guide (the Clawback Listing Standards ). 
 Administration 
 This Policy shall be administered by the Board or, if so designated by the Board, the Compensation Committee, in which case references herein to the Board shall be deemed references to the Compensation Committee. Any determinations made by the Board shall be final and binding on all affected individuals. 
 Covered Executives 
 This Policy applies to the Company's current and former executive officers, as determined by the Board in accordance with the definition in Section 10D of the Exchange Act and the Clawback Listing Standards, who may from time to time be deemed subject to the Policy by the Board Covered Executives ). 
 Recoupment Accounting Restatement 
 In the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company's material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period, the Board will require reimbursement or forfeiture of any excess Incentive Compensation received by any Covered Executive during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement. 
 Incentive Compensation 
 For purposes of this Policy, Incentive Compensation means any of the following provided that, such compensation is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of a financial reporting measure 
 Annual bonuses and other short- and long-term cash incentives.

 Re Evaluation of the Oil and Gas Properties of 
 Barnwell of Canada, Limited and Octavian Oil Ltd. 

Dear Sirs 
 
 As requested, an evaluation has been made of all of the crude oil and natural gas assets of Barnwell of Canada, Limited and Octavian Oil Ltd., hereinafter referred to as the Company. The properties evaluated are located in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. The effective date of the reserve estimates presented in this report is September 30, 2023. The purpose of this evaluation and report is to fulfill Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements. 
 
 All Company assets were evaluated in full detail. Individual property evaluations were prepared in the context of belonging to a larger portfolio of properties. Due to the principal of aggregation of reserves, the total portfolio reserves estimate carries a higher degree of confidence than the estimates for the individual properties. 
 
 This evaluation is based in part on prices, currency exchange rates and estimates which, in future, may differ materially from the forecasts utilized herein. In addition, changes in government policy and regulation may result in higher (or lower) royalties and taxes and the change may be material therefore, the present values of revenues documented in this report do not necessarily represent the fair market value of the reserves evaluated. The reserve estimates presented in this report are considered reasonable as of the effective date of the report given the quality and quantity of data available however, they should be accepted with the understanding that reservoir performance subsequent to the date of these estimates may necessitate revision, which may be material. 

Barnwell of Canada, Limited plus Octavian Oil Ltd. 
 Summary of Net Reserves Constant Prices and Costs 

Net Remaining Reserves Crude Oil (Stb) NGL + Cond. (Stb) Market Gas (Mcf) Proved Producing 653,000 126,500 4,095,600 Proved Non-Producing 42,000 5,900 306,100 Proved Undeveloped 92,000 17,500 608,200 Total Proved 787,000 149,900 5,009,900 

Constant prices were prepared based on posted prices of crude oil and natural gas, and natural gas liquids using a 12 month unweighted arithmetic average closing price of each commodity on the 1 st day of each month from October 1, 2022 through September 1, 2023 during the fiscal year. This report has been prepared using constant prices and costs and conforms to our understanding of the SEC s guidelines and applicable financial accounting rules. 
 
 All prices used in the evaluation have been adjusted from posted prices for applicable quality, heating value and transportation considerations. The weighted average prices, after applicable adjustments, over the life of the properties used in the evaluation were US 68.80 barrel of oil, US 2.67 per Mcf of gas, US 40.60 per barrel of condensate and natural gas liquids. 
 
 During the course of the evaluation, the Company provided InSite Petroleum Consultants Ltd. InSite personnel with basic information including land data, well information, geological information, reservoir studies, estimates of on-stream dates, contract details, operating cost data, capital budget forecasts, operating statements and other financial data and future operating plans. Additional engineering, geological or economic data used in the preparation of this report were obtained from public records, other operators and from InSite non-confidential files. InSite encountered no indications that the data was incomplete or inaccurate. Should evidence become available in the future suggesting that the data was incomplete or inaccurate, InSite reserves the right to revise the estimates based on new data. Similarly, the performance of the producing entities subsequent to the effective date of this report may necessitate upward or downward revisions to the reserve and production estimates. 
 
 In conducting our reserve analysis, proved reserve volumes were determined by volumetric, material balance, and production decline curve methods. The volumetric reserves were determined by reviewing all well logs, core, and geological data. Recovery factors were assigned after analyzing the performance of similar wells in the area. Historical well production was reviewed to determine reserves calculated by production decline curve analysis where sufficient historical data was available. The order of preference in choosing the methodology to be used was firstly production decline curve analysis or material balance where sufficient data was available for such analysis with volumetric calculations used where there was a lack of historical data. 
 
 The production and revenue forecasts for each property and the corporate cash flow summaries have not been adjusted for risk. Well abandonment, decommissioning and site reclamation costs (ADR) were included in the economic runs for all wells with reserves assigned, as wells as the ADR costs for producing wells with no reserves assigned, suspended wells and existing facilities. The ADR costs and timing were adopted from the Company s internal Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) estimates. 
 
 The oil and gas reserves calculations and income projections upon which this report is based, were determined in accordance with generally accepted evaluation practices. InSite used all assumptions, data, methods and procedures it considered appropriate, under the circumstances, to prepare this report. 
 
 The extent and character of ownership and all factual data supplied by the Company were accepted as presented. A field inspection was not considered necessary by InSite. 

In this report, gross (or Company share) reserves are defined as the total remaining recoverable reserves owned by the Company before deduction of any royalties. Net reserves are defined as those accruing to the Company after all interests owned by others including Crown and Freehold royalties have been deducted. The reserve category definitions utilized in this report are in accordance with SEC standards and Regulation S-X. 

Yours very truly, 
 
 InSite Petroleum Consultants Ltd.

Dear Mr. Roche 
 
 At your request, Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott) has prepared an estimate of the proved reserves, future production, and income attributable to certain leasehold and royalty interests of Teton Barnwell Fund I, LLC (TBF1), a fund managed by Gros Ventre Partners, LLC (Gros Ventre), as of September 30, 2023. TBF1 is an entity formed by Gros Ventre and BOK Drilling, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Barnwell Industries, Inc. (Barnwell), for the purpose of investing in oil and natural gas exploration and development in Oklahoma. Accordingly, the subject properties in this report are located in the state of Oklahoma. The reserves and income data were estimated based on the definitions and disclosure guidelines of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contained in Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations). Our third party study, completed on October 11, 2023 and presented herein, was prepared for public disclosure by Barnwell in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth in the SEC regulations. 
 
 The properties evaluated by Ryder Scott account for a portion of Barnwell s total net proved liquid hydrocarbon and gas reserves as of September 30, 2023. Based on information provided by Barnwell, the third party estimate conducted by Ryder Scott addresses approximately 10 percent of the total proved net reserves of Barnwell on a barrel of oil equivalent, BOE, basis as of September 30, 2023. Natural gas is converted to oil equivalent using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas per one barrel of oil equivalent. 
 
 The estimated reserves and future net income amounts presented in this report, as of September 30, 2023 are related to hydrocarbon prices. The hydrocarbon prices used in the preparation of this report are based on the average prices during the 12-month period prior to the as of date of this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, as required by the SEC regulations. Actual future prices may vary considerably from the prices that were used in this report. The reserves volumes and the income attributable thereto have a direct relationship to the hydrocarbon prices actually received therefore, volumes of reserves actually recovered and the amounts of income actually received may differ significantly from the estimated quantities presented in this report. The results of this study are summarized as follows.

In this report, the revenues, deductions, and income data are expressed as thousands of U.S. dollars M). 
 
 The estimates of the reserves, future production, and income attributable to properties in this report were prepared using the economic software package ARIES TM Petroleum Economics and Reserves Software, a copyrighted program of Halliburton. The program was used at the request of TBF1. Ryder Scott has found this program to be generally acceptable, but notes that certain summaries and calculations may vary due to rounding and may not exactly match the sum of the properties being summarized. Furthermore, one line economic summaries may vary slightly from the more detailed cash flow projections of the same properties, also due to rounding. The rounding differences are not material. 
 
 The future gross revenue is after the deduction of production taxes. The deductions incorporate the normal direct costs of operating the wells and certain abandonment costs net of salvage. The future net income is before the deduction of state and federal income taxes and general administrative overhead, and has not been adjusted for outstanding loans that may exist nor does it include any adjustment for cash on hand or undistributed income. 
 
 Liquid hydrocarbon reserves account for approximately 74 percent and gas reserves account for the remaining 26 percent of total future gross revenue from proved reserves. 
 
 The discounted future net income shown above was calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum compounded monthly. Future net income was discounted at four other discount rates which were also compounded monthly. These results are shown in summary form as follows.

Reserves Included in This Report 
 
 The proved reserves included herein conform to the definition as set forth in the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). An abridged version of the SEC reserves definitions from 210.4-10(a) entitled PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS is included as an attachment to this report. 
 
 The various reserves status categories are defined in the attachment entitled PETROLEUM RESERVES STATUS DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES in this report. 
 
 No attempt was made to quantify or otherwise account for any accumulated gas production imbalances that may exist. The proved gas volumes presented herein do not include volumes of gas consumed in operations as reserves. 
 
 Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. All reserves estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends primarily on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal categories, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-categorized as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability. At TBF1 s request, this report addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties evaluated herein. 
 
 Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward. The proved reserves included herein were estimated using deterministic methods. The SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves, when based on deterministic methods, as a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. 
 
 Proved reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. For proved reserves, the SEC states that as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease. Moreover, estimates of proved reserves may be revised as a result of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks. Therefore, the proved reserves included in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as being exact quantities, and if 
 RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS

recovered, the revenues therefrom, and the actual costs related thereto, could be more or less than the estimated amounts. 
 
 TBF1 s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations. These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax and are subject to change from time to time. Such changes in governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the estimated quantities. 
 
 The estimates of proved reserves presented herein were based upon a detailed study of the properties in which TBF1 owns an interest however, we have not made any field examination of the properties. No consideration was given in this report to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor were any costs included for potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices. 

Estimates of Reserves 
 
 The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods (1) performance-based methods, (2) volumetric-based methods and (3) analogy. These methods may be used individually or in combination by the reserves evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. Reserves evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated, and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property. 
 
 In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator. When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves. If the reserves quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserves category assigned by the evaluator. Therefore, it is the categorization of reserves quantities as proved, probable and or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported. For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty wherein the quantities actually recovered are much more likely to be achieved than not. The SEC states that probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. The SEC states that possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves and the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. All quantities of reserves within the same reserves category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above. 
 Estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may be revised in the future as additional geoscience or engineering data become available. Furthermore, estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may also be revised due to other factors such as changes in economic conditions, results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks as previously noted herein. 
 
 The proved reserves for the properties included herein were estimated by decline curve analysis, a performance method which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data 
 RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS 

Teton Barnwell Fund I, LLC (As Of September 30, 2023) 
 October 11, 2023 
 Page 5 

available through September 2023. The data utilized in this analysis were furnished to Ryder Scott by TBF1 and were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof. 
 
 To estimate economically producible proved oil and gas reserves and related future net cash flows, we consider many factors and assumptions including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates. Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may increase or decrease from those under existing economic conditions, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in making this evaluation. 
 
 TBF1 has informed us that they have furnished us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this investigation. In preparing our forecast of future proved production and income, we have relied upon data furnished by TBF1 with respect to property interests owned, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and or processing fees, production taxes, abandonment costs after salvage, adjustments or differentials to product prices, and pressure measurements. Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data furnished by TBF1. We consider the factual data used in this report appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of preparing the estimates of reserves and future net revenues herein. 
 
 In summary, we consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used in this report appropriate for the purpose hereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate to prepare the estimates of reserves herein. The proved reserves included herein were determined in conformance with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule, including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, referred to herein collectively as the SEC Regulations. In our opinion, the proved reserves presented in this report comply with the definitions, guidelines and disclosure requirements as required by the SEC regulations. 

Future Production Rates 
 
 Our forecasts of future production rates are based on the individual historical production data and the performance trend of each well. These future production rates may be more or less than estimated because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity and or operating conditions, producing market demand and or allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies. 
 Hydrocarbon Prices 
 
 The hydrocarbon prices used herein are based on SEC price parameters using the average prices during the 12-month period prior to the as of date of this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period. 
 
 We furnished TBF1 with the above mentioned average benchmark prices in effect on September 30, 2023. These initial SEC hydrocarbon prices were determined using the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold. These benchmark prices are prior to the adjustments for differentials as described herein. The table below summarizes the benchmark prices and price reference used for the geographic area included in the report. 
 
 The product prices which were actually used to determine the future gross revenue for each property reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and

transportation fees and or distance from market, referred to herein as differentials. The differentials used in the preparation of this report were furnished to us by TBF1. The differentials furnished to us were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by TBF1 to determine these differentials. 
 
 In addition, the table below summarizes the net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials and referred to herein as the average realized prices. The average realized prices shown in the table below were determined from the total future gross revenue before production taxes and the total net reserves for the geographic area and presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for the geographic area included in the report.

 Operating costs for the leases and wells in this report were furnished by TBF1 and are based on the operating expense reports of TBF1 and include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells. The operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells. The operating costs furnished to us were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the operating cost data used by TBF1. No deduction was made for loan repayments, interest expenses, or exploration and development prepayments that were not charged directly to the leases or wells. 
 
 The estimated net cost of abandonment after salvage was included for properties where abandonment costs net of salvage were material. The estimates of the net abandonment costs furnished by TBF1 were accepted without independent verification. 
 
 Current costs used by TBF1 were held constant throughout the life of the properties.

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS 
 
 As Adapted From 
 RULE 4-10(a) of REGULATION S-X PART 210 
 UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) 

PREAMBLE 
 
 On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule includes revisions and additions to the definition section in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K. The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule , including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the SEC regulations . The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010. Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein). 
 
 Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability. Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents publicly filed with the SEC. The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in 229.1202 Instruction to Item 1202. 
 
 Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. 
 
 Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods. Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery. Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids. Other improved recovery methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve. 
 
 Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations. Petroleum accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale. Examples of unconventional petroleum accumulations include coalbed or coalseam methane (CBM CSM), basin-centered gas, shale gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits. These unconventional accumulations may require specialized extraction technology and or significant processing prior to sale.

Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory. 
 
 Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from different reserves categories. 

RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows 
 
 Reserves. Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. 
 
 Note to paragraph (a)(26) Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir i.e. , absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources i.e. , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). 

PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows 
 
 Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 
 
 (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes 
 
 (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and 
 
 (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. 
 PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) CONTINUED 
 
 (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 
 
 (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 
 
 RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS 

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS 
 Page 3 

(iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when 
 (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and 
 
 (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 
 
 (v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.

Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs. Reference should be made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein). 

DEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows 
 
 Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered 
 
 (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and 
 
 (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 
 
 Developed Producing (SPE-PRMS Definitions) 
 
 While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing. 
 
 Developed Producing Reserves 
 Developed Producing Reserves are expected quantities to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the effective date of the estimate. 
 
 Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation. 
 
 RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS 

PETROLEUM RESERVES STATUS DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES 
 Page 2 

Developed Non-Producing 
 Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe Reserves. 
 
 Shut-In 
 Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from 
 (1) completion intervals that are open at the time of the estimate but which have not yet started producing 
 (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections or 
 (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons. 
 
 Behind-Pipe 
 Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells that will require additional completion work or future re-completion before start of production with minor cost to access these reserves. 
 
 In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well. 

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as follows 
 
 Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
 
 (1) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. 
 
 (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time. 
 
 (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.

Ladies and Gentlemen 
 
 At your request, Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott) has prepared an estimate of the proved reserves, future production, and income attributable to certain leasehold interests of Barnwell Texas LLC, a subsidiary of Barnwell Industries, Inc. (collectively, Barnwell) as of September 30, 2023. The subject properties are located in the state of Texas. The reserves and income data were estimated based on the definitions and disclosure guidelines of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contained in Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations). Our third party study, completed on October 3, 2023 and presented herein, was prepared for public disclosure by Barnwell in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth in the SEC regulations. 
 
 The properties evaluated by Ryder Scott account for a portion of Barnwell s total net proved liquid hydrocarbon and gas reserves as of September 30, 2023. Based on information provided by Barnwell, the third party estimate conducted by Ryder Scott addresses approximately 14 percent of the total proved net reserves of Barnwell on a barrel of oil equivalent, BOE, basis as of September 30, 2023. Natural gas is converted to oil equivalent using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas per one barrel of oil equivalent. 
 
 The estimated reserves and future net income amounts presented in this report, as of September 30, 2023 are related to hydrocarbon prices. The hydrocarbon prices used in the preparation of this report are based on the average prices during the 12-month period prior to the as of date of this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, as required by the SEC regulations. Actual future prices may vary considerably from the prices that were used in this report. The reserves volumes and the income attributable thereto have a direct relationship to the hydrocarbon prices actually received therefore, volumes of reserves actually recovered and the amounts of income actually received may differ significantly from the estimated quantities presented in this report. The results of this study are summarized as follows.

In this report, the revenues, deductions, and income data are expressed as thousands of U.S. dollars M). 
 
 The estimates of the reserves, future production, and income attributable to properties in this report were prepared using the economic software package ARIES TM Petroleum Economics and Reserves Software, a copyrighted program of Halliburton. The program was used at the request of Barnwell. Ryder Scott has found this program to be generally acceptable, but notes that certain summaries and calculations may vary due to rounding and may not exactly match the sum of the properties being summarized. Furthermore, one line economic summaries may vary slightly from the more detailed cash flow projections of the same properties, also due to rounding. The rounding differences are not material. 
 
 The future gross revenue is after the deduction of production taxes. The deductions incorporate the normal direct costs of operating the wells, ad valorem taxes and certain abandonment costs net of salvage. The future net income is before the deduction of state and federal income taxes and general administrative overhead, and has not been adjusted for outstanding loans that may exist nor does it include any adjustment for cash on hand or undistributed income. 
 
 Liquid hydrocarbon reserves account for approximately 80 percent and gas reserves account for the remaining 20 percent of total future gross revenue from proved reserves. 
 
 The discounted future net income shown above was calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum compounded monthly. Future net income was discounted at four other discount rates which were also compounded monthly. These results are shown in summary form as follows.

Reserves Included in This Report 
 
 The proved reserves included herein conform to the definition as set forth in the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). An abridged version of the SEC reserves definitions from 210.4-10(a) entitled PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS is included as an attachment to this report. 
 
 The various reserves status categories are defined in the attachment entitled PETROLEUM RESERVES STATUS DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES in this report. 
 
 No attempt was made to quantify or otherwise account for any accumulated gas production imbalances that may exist. The proved gas volumes presented herein do not include volumes of gas consumed in operations as reserves. 
 
 Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. All reserves estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends primarily on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal categories, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-categorized as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability. At Barnwell s request, this report addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties evaluated herein. 
 
 Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward. The proved reserves included herein were estimated using deterministic methods. The SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves, when based on deterministic methods, as a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. 
 
 Proved reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. For proved reserves, the SEC states that as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease. Moreover, estimates of proved reserves may be revised as a result of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks. Therefore, the proved reserves included in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as being exact quantities, and if 
 RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS 

Barnwell Texas LLC SEC Parameters

 Page 4 

recovered, the revenues therefrom, and the actual costs related thereto, could be more or less than the estimated amounts. 
 
 Barnwell s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations. These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax and are subject to change from time to time. Such changes in governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the estimated quantities. 
 
 The estimates of proved reserves presented herein were based upon a detailed study of the properties in which Barnwell owns an interest however, we have not made any field examination of the properties. No consideration was given in this report to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor were any costs included for potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices. 

Estimates of Reserves 
 
 The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods (1) performance-based methods, (2) volumetric-based methods and (3) analogy. These methods may be used individually or in combination by the reserves evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. Reserves evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated, and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property. 
 
 In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator. When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves. If the reserves quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserves category assigned by the evaluator. Therefore, it is the categorization of reserves quantities as proved, probable and or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported. For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty wherein the quantities actually recovered are much more likely to be achieved than not. The SEC states that probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. The SEC states that possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves and the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. All quantities of reserves within the same reserves category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above. 
 Estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may be revised in the future as additional geoscience or engineering data become available. Furthermore, estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may also be revised due to other factors such as changes in economic conditions, results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks as previously noted herein. 
 
 The reserves attributable to the producing wells in this report are very early-life and were estimated by a combination of performance and analogy methods. Decline curve analysis, a performance method which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data available 
 RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS 

Barnwell Texas LLC SEC Parameters 
 October 3, 2023 
 Page 5 

through mid-September 2023, was used to project short term production from the initial rates and decline trend of each well. Longer term performance was then guided by analogy to older, more established wells in the general vicinity. The data used in these analyses were furnished to Ryder Scott by Barnwell or obtained from public data sources and were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof. 
 
 To estimate economically producible proved oil and gas reserves and related future net cash flows, we consider many factors and assumptions including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates. Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may increase or decrease from those under existing economic conditions, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in making this evaluation. 
 
 Barnwell has informed us that they have furnished us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this investigation. In preparing our forecast of future proved production and income, we have relied upon data furnished by Barnwell with respect to property interests owned, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and or processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, and adjustments or differentials to product prices. Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data furnished by Barnwell. We consider the factual data used in this report appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of preparing the estimates of reserves and future net revenues herein. 
 
 In summary, we consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used in this report appropriate for the purpose hereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate to prepare the estimates of reserves herein. The proved reserves included herein were determined in conformance with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule, including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, referred to herein collectively as the SEC Regulations. In our opinion, the proved reserves presented in this report comply with the definitions, guidelines and disclosure requirements as required by the SEC regulations. 

Future Production Rates 
 
 For wells currently on production, our forecasts of future production rates are based partly on the early-life performance data of each well, as well as analogy to longer-term decline trends and performance of analogous wells. 
 The future production rates from wells currently on production may be more or less than estimated because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity and or operating conditions, producing market demand and or allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies. 

Hydrocarbon Prices 
 
 The hydrocarbon prices used herein are based on SEC price parameters using the average prices during the 12-month period prior to the as of date of this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period. 
 
 We provided Barnwell with the above mentioned average benchmark prices in effect on September 30, 2023. These initial SEC hydrocarbon prices were determined using the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the

hydrocarbons are sold. These benchmark prices are prior to the adjustments for differentials as described herein. The table below summarizes the benchmark prices and price reference used for the geographic area included in the report. 
 
 The product prices that were actually used to determine the future gross revenue for each property reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, oil transportation fees and or distance from market, referred to herein as differentials. The differentials used in the preparation of this report were estimated by us based on information furnished by Barnwell. 
 
 In addition, the table below summarizes the net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials and referred to herein as the average realized prices. The average realized prices shown in the table below were determined from the total future gross revenue before production taxes and the total net reserves for the geographic area and presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for the geographic area included in the report.

The effects of derivative instruments designated as price hedges of oil and gas quantities are not reflected in our individual property evaluations. 

Costs 
 
 Operating costs for the leases and wells in this report were furnished by Barnwell and are based on pre-drill estimates provided to Barnwell by the operator. The operating costs furnished to us were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the operating cost data used by Barnwell or the operator. No deduction was made for loan repayments, interest expenses, or exploration and development prepayments that were not charged directly to the leases or wells. 
 
 The net cost of abandonment after salvage was estimated by us and included for each well. 
 
 Current costs used in this evaluation were held constant throughout the life of the properties.

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS 
 
 As Adapted From 
 RULE 4-10(a) of REGULATION S-X PART 210 
 UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) 

PREAMBLE 
 
 On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule includes revisions and additions to the definition section in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K. The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule , including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the SEC regulations . The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010. Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein). 
 
 Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability. Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents publicly filed with the SEC. The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in 229.1202 Instruction to Item 1202. 
 
 Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. 
 
 Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods. Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery. Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids. Other improved recovery methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve. 
 
 Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations. Petroleum accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale. Examples of unconventional petroleum accumulations include coalbed or coalseam methane (CBM CSM), basin-centered gas, shale gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits. These unconventional accumulations may require specialized extraction technology and or significant processing prior to sale.

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS 
 Page 2 

Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory. 
 
 Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from different reserves categories. 

RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows 
 
 Reserves. Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. 
 
 Note to paragraph (a)(26) Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir i.e. , absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources i.e. , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). 

PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows 
 
 Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 
 
 (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes 
 
 (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and 
 
 (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. 
 PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) CONTINUED 
 
 (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 
 
 (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS 
 Page 3 

(iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when 
 (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and 
 
 (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 
 
 (v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.

Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs. Reference should be made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein). 

DEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows 
 
 Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered 
 
 (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and 
 
 (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 
 
 Developed Producing (SPE-PRMS Definitions) 
 
 While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing. 
 
 Developed Producing Reserves 
 Developed Producing Reserves are expected quantities to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the effective date of the estimate. 
 
 Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation.

PETROLEUM RESERVES STATUS DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES 
 Page 2 

Developed Non-Producing 
 Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe Reserves. 
 
 Shut-In 
 Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from 
 (1) completion intervals that are open at the time of the estimate but which have not yet started producing 
 (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections or 
 (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons. 
 
 Behind-Pipe 
 Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells that will require additional completion work or future re-completion before start of production with minor cost to access these reserves. 
 
 In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well. 

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as follows 
 
 Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
 
 (1) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. 
 
 (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time. 
 
 (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
