 Summary of Risk Factors 
 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties that we face are related to: 
 
 our ability to remain in compliance with the financial and operational covenants of our Truist Credit Facility; 

our ability to operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities; 

the prospects of our portfolio companies and the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives, the decline or failure of which may result in our borrowers defaulting on their payments to us; 

the ability of our Investment Adviser to hire and retain qualified personnel, to monitor and administer our investments and to manage our future growth effectively; 

changes to the interest rate environment, including the discontinuation of LIBOR and its impact on the value of floating-rate debt securities in our portfolio or issued by us; 

our reliance on information systems, the failure of which could result in delays or other problems with our business activities, and the susceptibility of such systems to cybersecurity threats; 

our ability to replicate historical performance of other investment companies and funds with which our professionals have been affiliated; 

our ability to raise additional capital while remaining in compliance with certain annual distribution, asset coverage, asset composition and other regulatory requirements needed to maintain our status as a BDC and a RIC; 

our ability to comply with applicable SBA requirements; 

the use of leverage to fund our investments, including the indebtedness resulting from our Truist Credit Facility, 2026 Notes, and 2026 Notes-2, and the risk that we may fail to comply with the terms governing such indebtedness or maintain certain asset coverage ratio requirements; 

our issuance of debt securities and/or preferred stock and the impact of such issuances on the value of our common stock or NAV; 

market conditions that may make it difficult for us to refinance or extend the maturity of our existing indebtedness; 

potential conflicts of interest of our Investment Adviser and Administrator; 

the potential dilution caused by any future issuances of subscription rights or warrants; 

the impact of recent financial reform legislation, and uncertainty about any future laws and regulations on our business and our portfolio companies; 

the investment objectives and decisions advanced by the board of directors or the Investment Adviser which are not subject to stockholder approval and potential activism by our shareholders; 

the illiquid nature of the assets in which we invest and our valuation procedures with respect to such assets; 

making investments in first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and the equity of certain portfolio companies, and the risks of making such investments in privately held middle-market companies; 

the Investment Adviser s incentive to make speculative investments to earn a greater incentive fee and, in some instances, our obligation to pay incentive compensation to our Investment Adviser even after we incur a loss; 

our investment in derivatives and the use of leverage 

the potential dilution of our common stock which may result from issuances of our common stock below the then current NAV per share; 

3 

our allocation of net proceeds from offering in ways which you may not agree and our inability to invest proceeds from offerings in new investment opportunities, which could negatively affect our financial performance; 

tax liabilities resulting from reinvestments in our common stock or from receiving our stock as a distribution; 

the measures we have taken to deter takeover attempts, which may adversely impact the price of our common stock; 

changes to political, economic or industry conditions or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, including changes caused by the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia that could cause volatility or prolonged disruption of the capital markets and impact the value of our assets; 

our cash balances at financial institutions that exceeds federally insured limits and the impact of adverse developments affecting the financial services industry; 

the impact of economic sanction laws in the United States and other jurisdictions which may prohibit us and our affiliates from transacting with certain countries, individuals and companies; 

potential litigation, whether initiated by shareholders or other parties; and 

the impact of global climate change on the operations of our portfolio companies. 

we have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, and we may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, which may result in future financial statements containing errors that will be undetected and could impact the operations of our business including our ability to obtain financing, the cost of any financing we obtain or require additional expenditures of resources to comply with applicable requirements. 

Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results. For a more detailed discussion of the risks that you should consider prior to investing in our securities, see Item 1A. Risk Factors below. 
 Item 1. Business 
 General Business of PennantPark Investment Corporation 
 PennantPark Investment Corporation is a BDC whose objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation while seeking to preserve capital through debt and equity investments primarily made to U.S. middle-market companies in the form of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments. 
 We believe U.S. middle-market companies offer attractive risk-reward to investors due to a limited amount of capital available for such companies. We seek to create a diversified portfolio that includes first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments by investing approximately 10 million to 50 million of capital, on average, in the securities of middle-market companies. We expect this investment size to vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. We use the term middle-market to refer to companies with annual revenues between 50 million and 1 billion. The companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, are not rated by national rating agencies. If such companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard Poor s system) from the national rating agencies. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as leveraged loans, high yield securities or junk bonds and are often higher risk compared to debt instruments that are rated above investment grade and have speculative characteristics. Our debt investments may generally range in maturity from three to ten years and are made to U.S. and, to a limited extent, non-U.S. corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions. 
 Our investment activity depends on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives. 
 Organization and Structure of PennantPark Investment Corporation 
 PennantPark Investment Corporation, a Maryland corporation organized in January 2007, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. 
 SBIC II, our wholly-owned subsidiary, was organized in Delaware as a limited partnership in July 2012. SBIC II received a license from the SBA to operate as a SBIC under Section 301(c) of the 1958 Act in 2013. SBIC II s objectives were to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments generally by investing in SBA-eligible businesses that meet the investment selection criteria used by PennantPark Investment. We have repaid all outstanding debentures in connection with SBIC II, surrendered our SBA license and filed a certificate of termination. 
 
 Funding I, a wholly-owned subsidiary and a special purpose entity of the Company prior to July 31, 2020, was organized in Delaware as a limited liability company in February 2019. We formed Funding I in order to establish the BNP Credit Facility. The Investment Adviser serves as the servicer to Funding I and has irrevocably directed that the management fee owed to it with respect to such services be paid to us so long as the Investment Adviser remains the servicer. This arrangement did not increase our consolidated management fee. The BNP Credit Facility allowed Funding I to borrow up to 250 million at LIBOR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) plus 260 basis points during the reinvestment period. The BNP Credit Facility was secured by all of the assets held by Funding I. Funding I is no longer a subsidiary of PennantPark Investment as a result of the joint venture described below. 
 
 On July 31, 2020, we and certain entities and managed accounts of the private credit investment manager of Pantheon Ventures (UK) LLP Pantheon entered into a limited liability company agreement to co-manage PSLF, a newly-formed unconsolidated joint venture. In connection with this transaction, we contributed in-kind our formerly wholly-owned subsidiary, Funding I. As a result of this transaction, Funding I became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PSLF and has been deconsolidated from our financial statements. PSLF invests primarily in middle-market and other corporate debt securities consistent with our strategy. PSLF was formed as a Delaware limited liability company.

Our Investment Adviser and Administrator 
 We utilize the investing experience and contacts of PennantPark Investment Advisers in developing what we believe is an attractive and diversified portfolio. The senior investment professionals of the Investment Adviser have worked together for many years and average over 25 years of experience in the senior lending, mezzanine lending, leveraged finance, distressed debt and private equity businesses. In addition, our senior investment professionals have been involved in originating, structuring, negotiating, managing and monitoring investments in middle-market companies across changing economic and market cycles. We believe this experience and history have resulted in a reputation as a respected partner to financial sponsors, management teams, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, which provides us with access to substantial investment opportunities across the capital markets. Our Investment Adviser has a rigorous investment approach, which is based upon intensive financial analysis with a focus on capital preservation, diversification and active management. Since our Investment Adviser s inception in 2007, it has invested through its managed funds 18.5 billion in 653 companies with more than 200 different financial sponsors through its managed funds, which includes investments by the Company totaling 7.6 billion in 333 companies. 
 Our Administrator has experienced professionals with substantial backgrounds in finance and administration of registered investment companies. In addition to furnishing us with clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services, the Administrator also oversees our financial records as well as the preparation of our reports to stockholders and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and the SBA. The Administrator assists in the determination and publication of our net asset value, or NAV, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns, and monitors the payment of our expenses as well as the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Furthermore, our Administrator offers, on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer such assistance. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to our Business and Structure There are significant potential conflicts of interest which could impact our investment returns for more information. 
 Market Opportunity 
 We believe that the limited amount of capital available to middle-market companies, coupled with the desire of these companies for flexible sources of capital, creates an attractive investment environment for us. 
 We believe middle-market companies have faced difficulty raising debt in private markets. From time to time, banks, finance companies, hedge funds and collateralized loan obligation, or CLO, funds have withdrawn, and may again withdraw, capital from the middle-market, resulting in opportunities for alternative funding sources. 

We believe middle-market companies have faced difficulty in raising debt through the capital markets. Many middle-market companies look to raise funds by issuing high-yield bonds and broadly syndicated loans. We believe this approach to financing becomes difficult at times when institutional investors seek to invest in larger, more liquid offerings. We believe this has made it harder for middle-market companies to raise funds by issuing high-yield securities from time to time. 

We believe that credit market dislocation for middle-market companies improves the risk-reward on our investments. From time to time, market participants have reduced lending to middle-market and non-investment grade borrowers. As a result, we believe there is less competition in our market, more conservative capital structures, higher yields and stronger covenants. 

We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital likely to seek to combine their capital with sources of debt capital to complete private investments. We expect that private equity firms will continue to be active investors in middle-market companies. These private equity funds generally seek to leverage their investments by combining their capital with loans provided by other sources, and we believe that we are well-positioned to partner with such equity investors. 

We believe there is substantial supply of opportunities resulting from maturing loans that seek refinancing. We believe that demand for debt financing from middle-market companies will remain strong because these companies will continue to require credit to refinance existing debt, to support growth initiatives and to finance acquisitions. We believe the combination of strong demand by middle-market companies and, from time to time, the reduced supply of credit described above should increase lending opportunities for us. We believe this supply of opportunities coupled with a lack of demand offers attractive risk-reward to investors. 

Competitive Advantages 
 We believe that we have the following competitive advantages over other capital providers to middle-market companies: 
 a) Experienced Management Team 

The senior investment professionals of our Investment Adviser have worked together for many years and average over 25 years of experience in senior lending, mezzanine lending, leveraged finance, distressed debt and private equity businesses. These senior investment professionals have been involved in originating, structuring, negotiating, managing and monitoring investments in middle-market companies across changing economic and market cycles. We believe this extensive experience and history have resulted in a strong reputation across the capital markets. 
 Lending to middle-market companies requires in-depth diligence, credit expertise, restructuring experience and active portfolio management. For example, lending to middle-market companies in the United States is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of the information available with respect to such companies. We are able to provide value-added customized financial solutions to middle-market companies as a result of specialized due diligence, underwriting capabilities and more extensive ongoing monitoring required as lenders. 
 b) Disciplined Investment Approach with Strong Value Orientation 

We employ a disciplined approach in selecting investments that meet the long-standing, consistent value-oriented investment selection criteria employed by our Investment Adviser. Our value-oriented investment philosophy focuses on preserving capital and ensuring that our investments have an appropriate return profile in relation to risk. When market conditions make it difficult for us to invest according to our criteria, we are highly selective in deploying our capital. We believe this approach continues to enable us to build an attractive investment portfolio that meets our return and value criteria over the long-term. 
 We believe it is critical to conduct extensive due diligence on investment targets. In evaluating new investments we, through our Investment Adviser, conduct a rigorous due diligence process that draws from our Investment Adviser s experience, industry expertise and network of contacts. Among other things, our due diligence is designed to ensure that each prospective portfolio company will be able to meet its debt service obligations. See Investment Selection Criteria for more information. 
 5 

In addition to engaging in extensive due diligence, our Investment Adviser seeks to reduce risk by focusing on businesses with: 
 strong competitive positions; 

positive cash flow that is steady and stable; 

experienced management teams with strong track records; 

potential for growth and viable exit strategies; and 

capital structures offering appropriate risk-adjusted terms and covenants. 

c) Ability to Source and Evaluate Transactions through our Investment Adviser s Proactive, Research Capability and Established Network 

The management team of our Investment Adviser has long-term relationships with financial sponsors, management consultants and management teams that we believe enable us to evaluate investment opportunities effectively in numerous industries, as well as provide us access to substantial information concerning those industries. We identify potential investments both through active origination and through dialogue with numerous financial sponsors, management teams, members of the financial community and corporate partners with whom the professionals of our Investment Adviser have long-term relationships. 
 d) Flexible Transaction Structuring 

We are flexible in structuring investments and tailor investments to meet the needs of a portfolio company while also generating attractive risk-adjusted returns. We can invest in all parts of a capital structure and our Investment Adviser has extensive experience in a wide variety of securities for leveraged companies throughout economic and market cycles. 
 Our Investment Adviser seeks to minimize the risk of capital loss without foregoing potential for capital appreciation. In making investment decisions, we seek to invest in companies that we believe can generate consistent positive risk-adjusted returns. 
 We believe that the in-depth experience of our Investment Adviser will enable us to invest throughout various stages of the economic and market cycles and to provide us with ongoing market insights in addition to a significant investment opportunity. 
 Competition 
 Our primary competitors provide financing to middle-market companies and include other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies, CLO funds, private direct lending funds, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Additionally, alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, frequently invest in middle-market companies. As a result, competition for investment opportunities in middle-market companies can be intense. However, we believe that from time to time there has been a reduction in the amount of debt capital available to middle-market companies, which we believe has resulted in a less competitive environment for making new investments. 
 Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to our Business and Structure We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities for more information. 
 Leverage 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had the multi-currency Truist Credit Facility for up to 475.0 million (decreased from 500.0 million in September 2023), which may be further increased up to 750.0 million in borrowings with certain lenders and Truist Bank (formerly SunTrust Bank), acting as administrative agent, Regions Bank, acting as additional multicurrency lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting as syndication agent for the lenders. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had 212.4 million and 385.9 million, respectively, in outstanding borrowings under the Truist Credit Facility. The Truist Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 7.7 and 5.3 , respectively, exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitment, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022. The Truist Credit Facility is a revolving facility with a stated maturity date of July 29, 2027 for 475.0 million of the total commitment and the related obligations maturing on September 4, 2024) and pricing set at 235 basis points over SOFR.As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had 262.6 million and 114.1 million of unused borrowing capacity under the Truist Credit Facility, respectively, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. The Truist Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets excluding assets held by SBIC II. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with the terms of the Truist Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, SBIC II had zero and 20.0 million in debt commitments, respectively, all of which was drawn, as of September 30, 2022, with a weighted average interest rate of 2.9 as of September 30, 2022, exclusive of 3.4 of upfront fees. We repaid the remaining 20 million SBA debentures during the nine months ended June 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2022, our SBA debentures had maturities between March 2026 to March 2028. SBA debentures offer competitive terms such as being non-recourse to us, a 10-year maturity, semi-annual interest payments, not requiring principal payments prior to maturity and may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The SBA debentures were secured by all the investment portfolio assets of SBIC II and had a priority claim over such assets relative to all other creditors. See Regulation for more information. 
 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had zero in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes outstanding, respectively. The 2024 Notes were redeemed on November 13, 2021 at a redemption price of 25.00 per 2024 Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest to November 13, 2021, pursuant to the indenture governing the 2024 Notes. Interest on the 2024 Notes was paid quarterly at a rate of 5.5 per year. 
 In April 2021, we issued 150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes at a public offering price per note of 99.4 . Interest on the 2026 Notes is paid semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, at a rate of 4.50 per year, commencing November 1, 2021. The 2026 Notes mature on May 1, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option subject to a make-whole premium if redeemed more than three months prior to maturity. The 2026 Notes are general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2026 Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. We do not intend to list the 2026 Notes on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system. 
 In October 2021, we issued 165.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes-2 at a public offering price per note of 99.4 . Interest on the 2026 Notes-2 is paid semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, at a rate of 4.00 per year, commencing May 1, 2022. The 2026 Notes-2 mature on November 1, 2026 and

may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option subject to a make-whole premium if redeemed more than three months prior to maturity. The 2026 Notes-2 are general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2026 Notes-2 are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. We do not intend to list the 2026 Notes-2 on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system. 
 On February 5, 2019, our stockholders approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (which includes the SBCAA) as approved by our board of directors on November 13, 2018. As a result, the asset coverage requirement applicable to us for senior securities was reduced from 200 (i.e., 1 of debt outstanding for each 1 of equity) to 150 (i.e., 2 of debt outstanding for each 1 of equity), subject to compliance with certain disclosure requirements. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information. 
 Investment Policy Overview 
 We seek to create a diversified portfolio that includes first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and, to a lesser extent, equity by targeting an investment size of 10 million to 50 million in securities, on average, of middle-market companies. We expect this investment size to vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. The companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, are not rated by national rating agencies. If such unrated companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard Poor s system) from the national rating agencies. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as leveraged loans, high yield securities or junk bonds and are often higher risk compared to debt instruments that are rated above investment grade and have speculative characteristics. In addition, we expect our debt investments to range in maturity from three to ten years. 
 Over time, we expect that our portfolio will continue to consist primarily of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and, to a lesser extent, equity investments in qualifying assets such as private, or thinly traded or small market-capitalization, U.S. middle-market public companies. In addition, we may invest up to 30 of our portfolio in non-qualifying assets. These non-qualifying assets may include investments in public companies whose securities are not thinly traded or have a market capitalization of greater than 250 million, securities of middle-market companies located outside of the United States and investment companies as defined in the 1940 Act. We may acquire investments in the secondary markets. See Regulation Qualifying Assets and Investment Selection Criteria for more information. 
 
 Our board of directors has the authority to modify or waive certain of our operating policies and strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval (except as required by the 1940 Act). However, absent stockholder approval, under the 1940 Act we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies would have on our business, operating results and value of our common stock. Nevertheless, the effects of changes to our operating policies and strategies may adversely affect our business, our ability to make distributions and the value of our common stock. 
 
 First Lien Secured Debt 
 
 Structurally, first lien secured debt ranks senior in priority of payment to second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity, and benefits from a senior security interest in the assets of the borrower. As such, other creditors rank junior to our investments in these securities in the event of insolvency. Due to its lower risk profile and often more restrictive covenants as compared to second lien secured debt and subordinated debt, first lien secured debt generally earns a lower return than second lien secured debt and subordinated debt. In some cases first lien secured debt lenders receive opportunities to invest directly in the equity securities of borrowers and from time to time may also receive warrants to purchase equity securities. We evaluate these investment opportunities on a case-by-case basis. 
 
 Second Lien Secured Debt 
 
 Second lien secured debt usually ranks junior in priority of payment to first lien secured debt. Second lien secured debt holds a second priority with regard to right of payment in the event of insolvency. Second lien secured debt ranks senior to subordinated debt and common and preferred equity in borrowers capital structures. Due to its higher risk profile and often less restrictive covenants as compared to first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt generally earns a higher return than first lien secured debt. In many cases, second lien secured debt investors receive opportunities to invest directly in the equity securities of borrowers and from time to time may also receive warrants to purchase equity securities. We evaluate these investment opportunities on a case-by-case basis. 
 
 Subordinated Debt 
 
 Structurally, subordinated debt usually ranks junior in priority of payment to first lien secured debt and second lien secured debt, and is often unsecured. As such, other creditors may rank senior to us in the event of insolvency. Subordinated debt ranks senior to common and preferred equity in borrowers capital structures. Due to its higher risk profile and often less restrictive covenants as compared to first lien secured debt and second lien secured debt, subordinated debt generally earns a higher return than first lien secured debt and second lien secured debt. In many cases, subordinated debt investors receive opportunities to invest directly in the equity securities of borrowers, and from time to time, may also receive warrants to purchase equity securities. We evaluate these investment opportunities on a case-by-case basis. 
 Investment Selection Criteria 
 We are committed to a value-oriented philosophy used by the senior investment professionals of our Investment Adviser who manage our portfolio and seek to minimize the risk of capital loss without foregoing potential for capital appreciation. 
 We have identified several criteria, discussed below, that we believe are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies. These criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions. However, we caution that not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company in which we choose to invest. Generally, we seek to use our experience and access to market information to identify investment opportunities and to structure investments efficiently and effectively. 
 a) Leading and defensible competitive market positions 

The Investment Adviser invests in portfolio companies that it believes have developed strong positions within their markets. The Investment Adviser also seeks to invest in portfolio companies that it believes possess competitive advantages, for example, in scale, scope, customer loyalty, product pricing or product quality as compared to their competitors to protect their market position. 
 b) Investing in stable borrowers with positive cash flow 

Our investment philosophy places a premium on fundamental analysis and has a distinct value-orientation. The Investment Adviser invests in portfolio companies it believes to be stable and well-established, with strong cash flows and profitability. The Investment Adviser believes these attributes indicate portfolio companies that may 
 7 

be well-positioned to maintain consistent cash flow to service and repay their liabilities and maintain growth in their businesses or their relative market share. The Investment Adviser currently does not expect to invest significantly in start-up companies, companies in turnaround situations or companies with speculative business plans, although we are permitted to do so. 
 c) Management teams 

The Investment Adviser focuses on investments in which the portfolio company has an experienced management team with an established track record of success. The Investment Adviser typically requires that portfolio companies have in place proper incentives to align management s goals with our goals, including having equity interests. 
 d) Financial sponsorship 

The Investment Adviser may seek to cause us to participate in transactions sponsored by what it believes to be trusted financial sponsors. The Investment Adviser believes that a financial sponsor s willingness to invest significant equity capital in a portfolio company is an implicit endorsement of the quality of that portfolio company. Further, financial sponsors of portfolio companies with significant investments at risk may have the ability, and a strong incentive, to contribute additional capital in difficult economic times should financial or operational issues arise so as to maintain their ownership position. 
 e) Investments in different borrowers, industries and geographies 

The Investment Adviser seeks to invest our assets broadly among portfolio companies, across industries and geographical regions. The Investment Adviser believes that this approach may reduce the risk that a downturn in any one portfolio company, industry or geographical region will have a disproportionate impact on the value of our portfolio, although we are permitted to be non-diversified under the 1940 Act. 
 f) Viable exit strategy 

The Investment Adviser seeks to invest in portfolio companies that it believes will provide a steady stream of cash flow to repay our loans while also reinvesting in their respective businesses. The Investment Adviser expects that such internally generated cash flow, leading to the payment of interest on, and the repayment of the principal of, our investments in portfolio companies to be a key means by which we will exit from our investments over time. In addition, the Investment Adviser also seeks to invest in portfolio companies whose business models and expected future cash flows offer attractive exit possibilities. These companies include candidates for strategic acquisition by other industry participants and companies that may repay our investments through an initial public offering of common stock, refinancing or other capital markets transaction. 
 Due Diligence 
 We believe it is critical to conduct extensive due diligence in evaluating new investment targets. Our Investment Adviser conducts a rigorous due diligence process that is applied to prospective portfolio companies and draws from our Investment Adviser s experience, industry expertise and network of contacts. In conducting due diligence, our Investment Adviser uses information provided by companies, financial sponsors and publicly available information as well as information from relationships with former and current management teams, consultants, competitors and investment bankers. 
 Our due diligence may include: 
 review of historical and prospective financial information; 

research relating to the portfolio company s management, industry, markets, products and services and competitors; 

interviews with management, employees, customers and vendors of the potential portfolio company; 

on-site visits; 

review of loan documents; and 

background checks. 

Additional due diligence with respect to any investment may be conducted on our behalf by attorneys and accountants prior to the closing of the investment, as well as other outside advisers, as appropriate. 
 Upon the completion of due diligence on a portfolio company, the team leading the investment presents the investment opportunity to our Investment Adviser s investment committee. This committee determines whether to pursue the potential investment. All new investments are required to be reviewed by the investment committee of our Investment Adviser. The members of the investment committee receive no compensation from us. Rather, they are employees of and receive compensation from our Investment Adviser. 
 Investment Structure 
 Once we determine that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, we work with the management of that portfolio company and its other capital providers, including senior, junior and equity capital providers, to structure an investment. We negotiate with these parties to agree on how our investment is structured relative to the other capital in the portfolio company s capital structure. 
 We expect our first lien secured debt to have terms of three to ten years. We generally obtain security interests in the assets of our portfolio companies that will serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral may take the form of first priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. 
 Typically, our second lien secured debt and subordinated debt investments have maturities of three to ten years. Second lien secured debt and subordinated debt may take the form of a second priority lien on the assets of a portfolio company and have interest-only payments in the early years with cash or payment-in-kind, or PIK, payments with amortization of principal deferred to the later years. In some cases, we may invest in debt securities that, by their terms, convert into equity or additional debt securities or defer payments of interest for the first few years after our investment. Also, in some cases, our second lien secured debt and subordinated debt may be collateralized by a subordinated lien on some or all of the assets of the borrower. 
 8 

We seek to tailor the terms of the investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its profitability. For example, in addition to seeking a senior position in the capital structure of our portfolio companies, we seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by: 
 requiring a total return on our investments (including both interest in the form of a floor and potential equity appreciation) that compensates us for credit risk; 

incorporating put rights and call protection into the investment structure; and 

negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with our focus of preserving capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or participation rights. 

Our investments may include equity features, such as direct investments in the equity securities of borrowers or warrants or options to buy a minority interest in a portfolio company. Any warrants we may receive with our debt securities generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, so as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from these equity investments. We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the portfolio company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also obtain registration rights in connection with these equity investments, which may include demand and piggyback registration rights. 
 We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may exit certain investments earlier when a liquidity event, such as the sale or refinancing of a portfolio company, takes place. We also may turn over investments to better position the portfolio in light of market conditions. 
 Ongoing Relationships with Portfolio Companies 
 Monitoring 
 The Investment Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Investment Adviser also monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each portfolio company. 
 The Investment Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success in adhering to a portfolio company s business plan and compliance with covenants; 

periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 

comparisons to other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; 

attendance at and participation in board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and 

review of periodic financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 

The Investment Adviser monitors credit risk of each portfolio company regularly with a goal toward identifying early, and when able and appropriate, exiting investments with potential credit problems. This monitoring process may include reviewing: (1) a portfolio company s financial resources and operating history; (2) comparing a portfolio company s current operating results with the Investment Adviser s initial thesis for the investment and its expectations for the performance of the investment; (3) a portfolio company s sensitivity to economic conditions; (4) the performance of a portfolio company s management; (5) a portfolio company s debt maturities and capital requirements; (6) a portfolio company s interest and asset coverage; and (7) the relative value of an investment based on a portfolio company s anticipated cash flow. 
 Managerial Assistance 
 We offer significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. As a BDC, we are required to make available such significant managerial assistance within the meaning of Section 2(a)(47) of the 1940 Act. See Regulation for more information. 
 Staffing 
 We do not currently have any employees. Our Investment Adviser and Administrator have hired and expect to continue to hire professionals with skills applicable to our business plan, including experience in middle-market investing, senior lending, mezzanine lending, leveraged finance, distressed debt and private equity businesses.

Our executive officers and directors, as well as the senior investment professionals of the Investment Adviser and Administrator, may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do. Currently, the executive officers and directors, as well as certain of the current senior investment professionals of the Investment Adviser and Administrator, serve as officers and directors of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd., a publicly traded BDC, and other managed funds, as applicable. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which obligations might not be in the best interest of us or our stockholders. In addition, we note that any affiliated investment vehicle currently existing, or formed in the future, and managed by the Investment Adviser and/or its affiliates may, notwithstanding different stated investment objectives, have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. As a result, the Investment Adviser may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities among us and such other entities. The Investment Adviser will allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner consistent with our allocation policy, and we have received exemptive relief with respect to certain co-investment transactions. Where co-investment is unavailable or inappropriate, the Investment Adviser will choose which investment fund should receive the allocation. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to our Business and Structure There are significant potential conflicts of interest which could impact our investment returns for more information. 
 We may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the securities and instruments of other investment companies and companies that would be investment companies but are excluded from the definition of an investment company provided in Section 3(c) of the 1940 Act. We may also co-invest in the future on a concurrent basis with our affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable regulations, our trade allocation procedures and, if applicable, the terms of our exemptive relief.

Investment Management Agreement 
 We have entered into an agreement with the Investment Adviser, or the Investment Management Agreement, under which the Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, us. Mr. Penn, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is the managing member and a senior investment professional of, and has a financial and controlling interest in, PennantPark Investment Advisers. PennantPark Investment, through the Investment Adviser, has provided similar services to SBIC II under its respective investment management agreement. Such investment management agreement does not affect the management or incentive fees that we pay to the Investment Adviser on a consolidated basis. Under the terms of our Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser: 
 determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; 

identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies); 

closes and monitors the investments we make; and 

provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services, as we may need from time to time. 

PennantPark Investment Advisers services under our Investment Management Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services, without the prior approval of our stockholders or our board of directors, to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. Our board of directors monitors for any potential conflicts that may arise upon such a development. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives a fee from us, consisting of two components a base management fee and an incentive fee or, collectively, Management Fees. 
 Management Fees 
 Effective January 1, 2018, the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.50 of our average adjusted gross assets, which equals our gross assets (exclusive of U.S. Treasury Bills, temporary draws under any credit facility, cash and cash equivalents, repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions undertaken at the end of a fiscal quarter for purposes of preserving investment flexibility for the next quarter and unfunded commitments, if any) and is payable quarterly in arrears. In addition, on November 13, 2018, in connection with our board of directors approval of the application of the modified asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act to the Company, our board of directors also approved an amendment to the Investment Advisory Agreement reducing the Investment Adviser s annual base management fee from 1.50 to 1.00 on gross assets that exceed 200 of the Company s total net assets as of the immediately preceding quarter-end. This amendment became effective on February 5, 2019 with the amendment and restatement of the Investment Management Agreement on April 12, 2019. The base management fee is calculated based on the average adjusted gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. For example, if we sold shares on the 45th day of a quarter and did not use the proceeds from the sale to repay outstanding indebtedness, our gross assets for such quarter would give effect to the net proceeds of the issuance for only 45 days of the quarter during which the additional shares were outstanding. For periods prior to January 1, 2018, the base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 2.00 of our average adjusted gross assets . For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Investment Adviser earned base management fees of 16.5 million, 19.8 million and 17.3 million, respectively, from us. 
 The following is a hypothetical example of the calculation of average adjusted gross assets: 
 Gross assets as of December 31, 20XX = 160 million 
 U.S. Treasury bills and temporary draws on credit facilities as of December 31, 20XX = 10 million 
 Adjusted gross assets as of December 31, 20XX = 150 million 
 Gross assets as of March 31, 20XX = 200 million 
 U.S. Treasury bills and temporary draws on credit facilities as of March 31, 20XX = 20 million 
 Adjusted gross assets as of March 31, 20XX = 180 million 
 Average value of adjusted gross assets as of March 31, 20XX and December 31, 20XX, which are the two immediately preceding calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter equals 150 million + 180 million) / 2 = 165 million. 
 The incentive fee has two parts, as follows: 
 
 One part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income, including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as amendment, commitment, origination, prepayment penalties, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees received from portfolio companies, accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below), and any interest expense or amendment fees under any credit facilities and distribution paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, or OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, computed net of all realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a percentage of the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of 1.75 per quarter (7.00 annualized). Effective January 1, 2018, we pay the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.75 , (2) 100 of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1212 in any calendar quarter (8.4848 annualized), and (3) 17.5 of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds 2.1212 in any calendar quarter. These calculations are pro-rated for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter, if applicable. For periods prior to January 1, 2018, we paid the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income did not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.75 , (2) 100 of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeded the hurdle rate but was less than 2.1875 in any calendar quarter (8.75 annualized), and (3) 20 of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeded 2.1875 in any calendar quarter. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Investment Adviser earned 13.9million, 2.7 million, and 0.6 million, respectively, in incentive fees on net investment income from us.

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of quarterly incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income: 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 (expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 

Percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 allocated to income-related portion of incentive fee 
 
 The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement, as of the termination date) and, effective January 1, 2018, equals 17.5 of our realized capital gains (20.0 for periods prior to January 1, 2018), if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Investment Adviser did not accrue an incentive fee on capital gains as calculated under the Investment Management Agreement (as described above). 
 
 Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we are required to accrue a capital gains incentive fee based upon net realized capital gains and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the capital gains incentive fee accrual, we considered the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Management Agreement. This accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and cumulative unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then we record a capital gains incentive fee equal to 17.5 of such amount (20.0 for periods prior to January 1, 2018), less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains related to incentive fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such year. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Investment Adviser did not accrue an incentive fee on capital gains as calculated under GAAP. 
 Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation 
 Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee ): 
 Alternative 1: 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25 
 Hurdle (1) = 1.75 
 Base management fee (2) = 0.375 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 (investment income (base management fee + other expenses)) = 0.675 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle; therefore, there is no incentive fee. 
 Alternative 2: 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.70 
 Hurdle (1) = 1.75 
 Base management fee (2) = 0.375 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 (investment income (base management fee + other expenses)) = 2.125 
 12 

Incentive fee 
 
 = 17.5 x Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, subject to catch-up 

= 2.125 - 1.75 

= 0.375 

= 100 x 0.375 

= 0.375 

Alternative 3: 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.00 
 Hurdle (1) = 1.75 
 Base management fee (2) = 0.375 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 (investment income (base management fee + other expenses)) = 2.425 

Incentive fee 
 
 = 17.5 x Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, subject to catch-up (3) 

Incentive fee 
 
 = 100 x catch-up + (17.5 x (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income - 2.1212 )) 

Catch-up 
 
 = 2.1212 - 1.75 

= 0.3712 

= (100 x 0.3712 + (17.5 x (2.425 - 2.1212 )) 

= 0.3712 + (17.5 x 0.3038 

= 0.3712 + 0.053165 

= 0.424365 

The hypothetical amount of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income shown is based on a percentage of total net assets. 
 (1) Represents 7.0 annualized hurdle. 

(2) Represents 1.5 annualized base management fee. 

(3) The catch-up provision is intended to provide the Investment Adviser with an incentive fee of 17.5 on all of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 2.1212 in any calendar quarter. 

Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee: 
 Assumptions 
 Year 1 = no net realized capital gains or losses 
 Year 2 = 6 realized capital gains and 1 realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation, capital gain incentive fee = 17.5 x (realized capital gains for year computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation at year end) 

Year 1 incentive fee 
 
 = 17.5 x (0) 

= 0 

= no incentive fee 

Year 2 incentive fee 
 
 = 17.5 x (6 - 1 

= 17.5 x 5 

= 0.875

 PennantPark Investment Advisers is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act. The principal executive office of PennantPark Investment Advisers is located at 1691 Michigan Ave, Miami Beach, Florida 33139. 
 Duration and Termination of Investment Management Agreement 
 
 The Investment Management Agreement was reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser in February 2023. Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Investment Management Agreement will continue in effect for a period of one year through February 2024. It will remain in effect if approved annually by our board of directors, or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser. In determining to reapprove the Investment Management Agreement, our board of directors requested information from the Investment Adviser that enabled it to evaluate a number of factors relevant to its determination. These factors included the nature, quality and extent of services performed by the Investment Adviser, the Investment Adviser s ability to manage conflicts of interest effectively, our short and long-term performance, our costs, including as compared to comparable externally and internally managed publicly traded BDCs that engage in similar investing activities, the Investment Adviser s profitability, any economies of scale, and any other benefits of the relationship for the Investment Adviser. Based on the information reviewed and the considerations detailed above, our board of directors, including all of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates and terms are fair and reasonable in relation to the services provided and reapproved the Investment Management Agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders. 
 The Investment Management Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Management Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days written notice to the other. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to our Business and Structure We are dependent upon our Investment Adviser s key personnel for our future success, and if our Investment Adviser is unable to hire and retain qualified personnel or if our Investment Adviser loses any member of its management team, our ability to achieve our investment objectives could be significantly harmed for more information.

Administration Agreement 
 We have entered into an agreement, or the Administration Agreement, with the Administrator, under which the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services. Under our Administration Agreement, the Administrator performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other activities, being responsible for the financial records we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Administrator assists us in determining and publishing our NAV, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. PennantPark Investment, through the Administrator, has provided similar services to SBIC II under its administration agreement with us. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, technology systems, insurance and our allocable portion of the cost of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Counsel and their respective staffs. The Administrator also offers on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies to which we are required to offer such assistance. To the extent that our Administrator outsources any of its functions, we will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without profit to the Administrator. Reimbursement for certain of these costs is included in administrative services expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we recorded 1.3 million, 0.5 million and 1.5 million, respectively, including expenses the Investment Adviser incurred on behalf of the Administrator for services described above. 
 On July 1, 2022, the Administration Agreement with the Administrator was amended to clarify that the Administrator may be reimbursed by the Company for certain (i) tax and general legal advice and/or services provided to the Company by in-house professionals of the Administrator related to ongoing operations of the Company; and (ii) transactional legal advice and/or services provided to the Company or portfolio companies by in-house professionals of the Administrator or its affiliates on matters related to potential or actual investments and transactions, including tax structuring and/or due diligence. 
 Duration and Termination of Administration Agreement 
 The Administration Agreement was reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us, in February 2023. Unless terminated earlier as described below, our Administration Agreement will continue in effect for a period of one year through February 2024. It will remain in effect if approved annually by our board of directors, or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us. The Administration Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the consent of the other party. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days written notice to the other. 
 Indemnification 
 Our Investment Management Agreement and Administration Agreement provide that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their duties and obligations, PennantPark Investment Advisers and PennantPark Investment Administration and their officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with them are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of PennantPark Investment Advisers and PennantPark Investment Administration s services under our Investment Management Agreement or Administration Agreement or otherwise as Investment Adviser or Administrator for us. 
 License Agreement 
 We have entered into a license agreement, or the License Agreement, with PennantPark Investment Advisers pursuant to which PennantPark Investment Advisers has granted us a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use the name PennantPark. Under this agreement, we have a right to use the PennantPark name, for so long as PennantPark Investment Advisers or one of its affiliates remains our Investment Adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the PennantPark name. 
 
 PennantPark Senior Loan Fund, LLC 
 In July 2020, we and Pantheon formed PSLF, an unconsolidated joint venture. PSLF invests primarily in middle-market and other corporate debt securities consistent with our strategy. PSLF was formed as a Delaware limited liability company. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022 PSLF had total assets of 872.8 million and 781.3 million, respectively, consisting of debt investments in 90 and 80 portfolio companies, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSLF was 19.7 million and the five largest investments totaled 97.5 million. As of September 30, 2022, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSLF was 19.9 million and the five largest investments totaled 98.5 million. PSLF invests in portfolio companies in the same industries in which we may directly invest. 
 We provide capital to PSLF in the form of subordinated notes and equity interests. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022 we and Pantheon owned 60.5 and 39.5 , respectively, of each of the outstanding subordinated notes and equity interests of PSLF. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, our investment in PSLF consisted of subordinated notes of 102.3 million and 88.0 million and had 13.6 million and 27.9 million unfunded commitments, respectively, and equity interests of 58.6 million and 49.4 million and had 8.8 million and 18.1 million unfunded commitments, respectively. 
 REGULATION 
 Business Development Company, Regulated Investment Company Regulations and Small Business Investment Company Regulations 
 We are a BDC under the 1940 Act, which has qualified and intends to continue to qualify to maintain an election to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between a BDC and its affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 
 We may invest up to 100 of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an underwriter as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. We may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of securities we own or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any registered investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3 of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5 of the value of our total assets in the securities of one registered investment company or invest more than 10 of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one registered investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. We may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate and currency fluctuations. None of these policies are fundamental and they may be changed without stockholder approval.

Qualifying Assets 
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70 of the BDC s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 
 (1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined under the 1940 Act to include any issuer which: 

(a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 

(b) is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly-owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but is excluded from the definition of an investment company by Section 3(c) of the 1940 Act; and 

(c) satisfies any of the following: 

(i) does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; 

(ii) has any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange subject to a maximum market capitalization of 250.0 million; or 

(iii) is controlled by a BDC, either alone or as part of a group acting together, and such BDC in fact exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of such eligible portfolio company and, as a result of such control, has an affiliated person who is a director of such eligible portfolio company. 

(2) Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control. 

(3) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. operating company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incidental thereto, if such issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. 

(4) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no readily available market for such securities and we already own 60 of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. 

(5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. 

(6) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 

In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. 
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
 As a BDC, we are required to make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies that constitute a qualifying asset within the meaning of Section 2(a)(47) of the 1940 Act. However, if a BDC purchases securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such significant managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. Our Administrator may provide such assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request such assistance. Officers of our Investment Adviser and Administrator may provide assistance to controlled affiliates. 
 Temporary Investments 
 Pending investments in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70 of our assets are qualifying assets. We may invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25 of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the Diversification Tests, as defined below under Regulation Election to be Treated as a RIC, in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Investment Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we may enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
 Our investment in PSLF, our unconsolidated joint venture with Pantheon, is not a qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. From time to time prior to making additional investments into PSLF, PTSF II or any future joint venture, we may increase our holdings of U.S. treasury securities, cash or cash equivalents (through borrowing or otherwise) so that such investments do not result in less than 70 of our assets being invested in qualifying assets. 
 Senior Securities 
 We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act and referred to as the asset coverage ratio, is compliant with the 1940 Act, immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage requirement at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5 of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to our asset coverage ratio. We received exemptive relief from the SEC allowing us to modify the asset coverage requirement to exclude the SBA debentures from the calculation. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Risk Factors Risks Relating to our Business and Structure Regulations governing our operation as a BDC will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital for more information.

Joint Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct 
 We and PennantPark Investment Advisers have adopted a joint code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and a code of conduct that establish procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the codes requirements. Our joint code of ethics and code of conduct are available, free of charge, on our website at www.pennantpark.com . In addition, the joint code of ethics is attached as an exhibit to this Report and is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC s Internet site at www.sec.gov . 
 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Investment Adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of our Investment Adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by our Investment Adviser and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures described below, we, our and us refer to our Investment Adviser. 
 Introduction 
 As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, our Investment Adviser have a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of their clients. As part of this duty, our Investment Adviser recognize that they must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of their clients. 
 These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 
 Proxy Policies 
 Our Investment Adviser vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what they perceive to be the best interests of our stockholders. Our Investment Adviser review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by its clients. Although our Investment Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on its clients portfolio securities, our Investment Adviser may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
 Our Investment Adviser proxy voting decisions are made by the senior investment professionals who are responsible for monitoring each of its clients investments. To ensure that the vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, our Investment Adviser requires that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to its Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 
 Proxy Voting Records 
 You may obtain information about how we voted proxies, free of charge, by calling us at (786) 297-9500 or by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Richard Allorto, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, 1691 Michigan Avenue, Miami Beach, Florida 33139. 
 Privacy Protection Principles 
 We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 
 Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain non-public personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third party administrator). 
 We restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to employees of our Investment Adviser and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders. 
 Our privacy protection policies are available, free of charge, on our website at www.pennantpark.com . In addition, the privacy policy is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC s Internet website at www.sec.gov , filed as an exhibit to our annual report on this Form 10-K. 
 Other 
 We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us, and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. 
 We will be periodically examined by the SEC and SBA for compliance with the 1940 Act and 1958 Act, respectively. 
 We are required by law to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person s office. 
 We and PennantPark Investment Advisers have each adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws. We review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and we designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, imposes several regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. 
 For example: 
 pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 

16 

pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; 

pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting; and 

pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated there-under. We continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and continue to take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance with that act. 
 Election to be Treated as a RIC 
 We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually to maintain our election to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC tax election, we must, among other requirements, meet certain annual source-of-income and quarterly asset diversification requirements (as described below). We also must annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of the sum of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, or investment company taxable income, and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid out of the assets legally available for distribution, or the Annual Distribution Requirement. 
 In order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, we must: 
 maintain an election to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; 

derive in each taxable year at least 90 of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain qualified publicly traded partnerships or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, or the 90 Income Test; and 

diversify our holdings, or the Diversification Tests, so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: 

1) at least 50 of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer neither represents more than 5 of the value of our assets nor more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and 

2) no more than 25 of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in certain qualified publicly traded partnerships. 

Although not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute in respect of each calendar year dividends to our stockholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of our net ordinary income (subject to certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of our capital gain net income (i.e., the excess, if any, of our capital gains over capital losses), adjusted for certain ordinary losses, generally for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year plus (3) any net ordinary income or capital gain net income for the preceding years that was not distributed during such years on which we did not incur any corporate income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. Although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above, we may retain and incur tax on such net capital gains or investment company taxable income, subject to maintaining our ability to be treated as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, in order to provide us with additional liquidity. 
 While we intend to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to avoid incurring any material U.S. federal excise tax on our earnings, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, distribute amounts sufficient to avoid the imposition of the tax entirely. In that event, we generally will be liable for the excise tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. Under certain circumstances, however, we may, in our sole discretion, determine that it is in our best interests to retain a portion of our income or capital gains rather than distribute such amount as dividends and accordingly cause us to bear the excise tax burden associated therewith. 
 
 We may invest in partnerships which may result in our being subject to additional state, local or foreign income, franchise or other tax liabilities. In addition, some of the income and fees that we may recognize will not satisfy the 90 Income Test. In order to mitigate the risk that such income and fees would disqualify us as a RIC as a result of a failure to satisfy the 90 Income Test, we may be required to recognize such income and fees indirectly through the Taxable Subsidiary, which is classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Taxable Subsidiary generally will be subject to corporate income taxes on its earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees. 
 Taxation as a RIC 
 If we qualify as a RIC, and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gains, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to stockholders. Additionally, upon satisfying these requirements, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any investment company taxable income or net capital gains, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, that is not distributed (or not deemed to have been distributed) as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders. 
 We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold a debt instrument that is treated under applicable tax rules as having OID (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each taxable year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the debt instrument, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any OID accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income in the taxable year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 
 We invest in below investment grade instruments. Investments in these types of instruments may present special tax issues for us. U.S. federal income tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when we may cease to accrue interest, OID or market discount, when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless debt instruments, how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income and whether exchanges of debt instruments 
 17 

in a bankruptcy or workout context are taxable. We will address these and other issues to the extent necessary in order to continue to maintain our qualification to be subject to tax as a RIC. 
 Gain or loss realized by us from equity securities and warrants acquired by us, as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants, generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. 
 We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy our Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt instruments and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain asset coverage requirements are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 
 We may distribute our common stock as a dividend from our taxable income and a stockholder could receive a portion of such distributions declared and distributed by us in shares of our common stock with the remaining amount in cash. A stockholder will be considered to have recognized dividend income generally equal to the fair market value of the stock paid by us plus cash received with respect to such dividend. The total dividend declared and distributed by us would be taxable income to a stockholder even though only a small portion of the dividend was paid in cash to pay any taxes due on the total dividend. We have not yet elected to distribute stock as a dividend but reserve the right to do so. 
 Failure to Qualify as a RIC 
 If we fail to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, unless certain cure provisions of the Code apply, we will be subject to tax in that taxable year on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any dividend distributions to our stockholders. In that case, all of our income will be subject to corporate-level federal income tax, reducing the amount available to be distributed to our stockholders. In contrast, assuming we qualify as a RIC, our corporate-level federal income tax should be substantially reduced or eliminated. See Election to be Treated as a RIC above for more information. 
 If we are unable to maintain our status as a RIC, we also would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would distributions be required to be made. Distributions would generally be taxable as dividends to our stockholders to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, U.S. non-corporate stockholders generally would be eligible to treat such dividends as qualified dividend income, which generally would be subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax, and dividends paid by us to certain U.S. corporate stockholders would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder s tax basis in our common stock, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. Moreover, if we fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, to qualify again to be treated as a RIC for federal income tax purposes in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to distribute our earnings and profits attributable to any of our non-RIC taxable years as dividends to our stockholders. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two consecutive taxable years, to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (that is, the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had sold the property at fair market value at the end of the taxable year) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five taxable years. 
 SBA Regulations 
 SBIC II was licensed to operate under the SBA as a SBIC under Section 301(c) of the 1958 Act and received its license in 2013. We have repaid all outstanding debentures in connection with SBIC II and surrendered its SBA license. 
 SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of capital to businesses that meet specified eligibility requirements discussed below. Under SBA regulations, SBIC II was subject to regulatory requirements including, among other things, making investments in SBA eligible small businesses (as defined by the SBA), investing at least 25 of regulatory capital in eligible smaller business enterprises , placing certain limitations on the financing terms of investments by SBICs in portfolio companies, prohibiting investing in certain industries, and meeting certain required capitalization thresholds among other regulations. Furthermore, SBIC II was subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA, including, among other things, periodic the performance of financial audits by an independent auditor and periodic examinations, including of SBIC II s of their financial statements that are prepared on a basis of accounting other than GAAP pursuant to SBA accounting standards and financial reporting requirements for SBICs. For example, SBIC II did not use fair value accounting on its assets or liabilities under SBA valuation guidelines. If SBIC II failed to comply with applicable SBA regulations, the SBA could, depending on the severity of the violation, limit or prohibit use of SBA-guaranteed debentures, declare outstanding debentures immediately due and payable, and/or limit SBIC II from making new investments. In addition, the SBA can revoke or suspend a SBIC license for willful or repeated violation of, or willful or repeated failure to observe, any provision of the 1958 Act or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder. These actions by the SBA would, in turn, negatively affect us. 
 Eligible Small and Smaller Businesses 
 Under present current SBA regulations, eligible small business generally include businesses that (together with their affiliates) have tangible net worth not exceeding 19.5 million and have average annual net income after U.S. federal income taxes not exceeding 6.5 million (average net income to be computed without benefit of any carryover loss) for the two most recent fiscal years. In addition, SBIC II was required to invest at least 25 of its investment capitals in smaller concerns enterprises . A smaller concern enterprise generally includes a business (together with its affiliates) that has tangible net worth not exceeding 6.0 million and has average annual net income after U.S. federal income taxes not exceeding 2.0 million (average net income to be computed without benefit of any carryover loss) for the two most recent fiscal years. SBA regulations also provide alternative industry size standard criteria to determine eligibility for designation as an eligible small business or a smaller enterprise, which criteria depend on the primary industry in which the business is engaged and is based on the number of employees or gross revenue of the business and its affiliates or as an alternative to the aforementioned requirement, meet the size requirements based on either the number of employees or gross revenue, which is based on the industry in which the smaller concern operates. However, once an SBIC has invested in a company, it may continue to make follow-on investments in the company, regardless of the size of the business at the time of the follow-on investment, up and until the time a business offers its securities in a public market through the company s initial public offering, if any. 
 Financing Limitations, Terms and Changes in Control 
 The SBA generally prohibits an SBIC from financing small businesses in certain industries, such as relending, gambling, oil and gas exploration and other passive businesses. Additional SBA prohibitions include investing outside the United States, investing more than 30 of regulatory capital in any one company and its affiliates and lending money to any officer, director or employee or to invest in any affiliate thereof. The SBA placed certain limits on the financing terms of investments by SBIC II in portfolio companies such as limiting the interest rate on debt securities and loans provided to portfolio companies. The SBA also limits fees, prepayment terms and other economic arrangements that are typically charged in lending arrangements. 
 The SBA also prohibited, without prior written approval, a change in control of SBIC II or transfers that would result in any person or group owning 10 or more of a class of capital stock (or its equivalent in the case of a partnership) of a licensed SBIC. A change of control is any event which would result in the transfer of power, direct or indirect, to direct management and policies of an SBIC, whether through ownership, contractual arrangements or otherwise. 
 18 

Idle Funds Limitation 
 The SBA limits an SBIC to investing idle funds in the following types of securities: 
 direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. Government, which mature within 15 months from the date of the investment; 

repurchase agreements with federally insured institutions with a maturity of seven days or less (and the securities underlying the repurchase obligations must be direct obligations of or guaranteed by the federal government); 

mutual funds, securities or other instruments that exclusively consist of, or represent pooled assets of, investments described in the first and second bulleted paragraphs above; 

certificates of deposit with a maturity of one year or less, issued by a federally insured institution; or 

a deposit account in a federally insured institution that is subject to withdrawal restriction of one year or less. 

a checking account in a federally insured institution; or 

a reasonable petty cash fund. 

SBA Leverage or Debentures 
 SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse to us, have a 10-year maturity, and may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed at the time of issuance at a market-driven spread over 10-year U.S. Treasury Notes. Leverage through SBA-guaranteed debentures is subject to required capitalization thresholds. SBA current regulations limit the amount that an SBIC may borrow to a maximum of 175.0 million, which is up to twice its regulatory capital, and a maximum of 350.0 million as part of a group of SBICs under common control. The SBA, as a creditor, had a superior claim to SBIC II s assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidated SBIC II or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by SBIC II upon an event of default. We have repaid all outstanding debentures in connection with SBIC II and have surrendered the SBA license. 
 19 

If the fair value of our portfolio companies reflects unrealized losses that are subsequently realized, we could experience reductions of our income available for distribution in future periods that could materially harm our results of operations and cause a material decline in the value of our publicly traded common stock. 

The IRS has issued regulations regarding the tax consequences of the transition from LIBOR or another interbank offered rate IBOR to a new reference rate in debt instruments and non-debt contracts. Under the regulations, alteration or modification of the terms of a debt instrument to replace an operative rate that uses a discontinued IBOR with a qualified rate (as defined in the regulations) including true up payments equalizing the fair market value of contracts before and after such IBOR transition, to add a qualified rate as a fallback rate to a contract whose operative rate uses a discontinued IBOR or to replace a fallback rate that uses a discontinued IBOR with a qualified rate would not be taxable. The IRS may provide additional guidance, with potential retroactive effect. 

distributions to our stockholders. Even if we qualify as a RIC, we generally will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if we do not distribute to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year an amount at least equal to the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. 

stockholders. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities. However, when required to be undertaken, the procedures used by the board of directors to determine the NAV per share of our common stock within 48 hours of each offering of our common stock may differ materially from and will necessarily be more abbreviated than the procedures used by the board of directors to determine the NAV per share of our common stock at the end of each quarter because there is a an extensive process each quarter to determine the NAV per share of our common stock which cannot be completed in 48 hours. The quarterly process includes preliminary valuation conclusions, engagement of independent valuation firms and review by those firms of preliminary valuation conclusions. By contrast, the procedures in connection with an offering may yield a NAV that is less precise than the NAV determined at the end of each quarter. We will not offer transferable subscription rights to our stockholders at a price equivalent to less than the then current NAV per share of common stock, excluding underwriting commissions, unless we first file a post-effective amendment that is declared effective by the SEC with respect to such issuance and the common stock to be purchased in connection with such rights represents no more than one-third of our outstanding common stock at the time such rights are issued. In addition, for us to file a post-effective amendment to a registration statement on Form N-2, we must then be qualified to register our securities under the requirements of Form S-3. We may actually issue shares above or below a future NAV. If we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock or warrants or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, the percentage ownership of our common stockholders at that time would decrease, and our common stockholders would experience voting dilution. 

 Securitization. In addition to issuing securities to raise capital as described above, we anticipate that in the future, as market conditions and the rules and regulations of the SEC permit, we may securitize our loans to generate cash for funding new investments. To securitize loans, we may create a wholly-owned subsidiary, contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary and have the subsidiary issue primarily investment grade debt securities to purchasers who we would expect to be willing to accept a substantially lower interest rate than the loans earn. Even though we expect the pool of loans that we contribute to any such securitization vehicle to be rated below investment grade, because the securitization vehicle s portfolio of loans would secure all of the debt issued by such vehicle, a portion of such debt may be rated investment grade, subject in each case to market conditions that may require such portion of the debt to be over collateralized and various other restrictions. If applicable accounting pronouncements or SEC staff guidance require us to consolidate the securitization vehicle s financial statements with our financial statements, any debt issued by it would be generally treated as if it were issued by us for purposes of the asset coverage ratio applicable to us. In such case, we would expect to retain all or a portion of the equity and/or subordinated notes in the securitization vehicle. Our retained equity would be exposed to any losses on the portfolio of loans before any of the debt securities would be exposed to such losses. Accordingly, if the pool of loans experienced a low level of losses due to defaults, we would earn an incremental amount of income on our retained equity but we would be exposed, up to the amount of equity we retained, to that proportion of any losses we would have experienced if we had continued to hold the loans in our portfolio. We may hold subordinated debentures in any such securitization vehicle and, if so, we would not consider such securities to be senior securities. An inability to successfully securitize our loan portfolio could limit our ability to grow our business and fully execute our business strategy and adversely affect our earnings, if any. Moreover, the successful securitization of a portion of our loan portfolio might expose us to losses as the residual loans in which we do not sell interests will tend to be those that are riskier and less liquid. 

 SBA Debentures. In addition to issuing securities and using securitizations to raise capital as described above, we have historically issued and may in the future issue, as permitted under SBA regulations and through our wholly-owned subsidiary, SBIC II, and any future SBIC subsidiary, SBA debentures to generate cash for funding new investments. To issue SBA debentures, we may request commitments for debt capital from the SBA. SBIC II is, and any future SBIC subsidiary has historically been exposed to any losses on its portfolio of loans;, however, such debentures are non-recourse to us. 

remain at current levels. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend upon our assessment of the market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. Lenders have fixed dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our common stockholders or preferred stockholders, if any, and we have granted a security interest in our assets, excluding those of SBIC II, in connection with borrowings under our Truist Credit Facility. In the case of a liquidation event, those lenders would receive proceeds before our stockholders. Any future debt issuance will increase our leverage and may be subordinate to our Truist Credit Facility and SBA debentures. In addition, borrowings or debt issuances and SBA debentures, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for loss or gain on amounts invested and, therefore, increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. Leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique. If the value of our assets decreases, then the use of leverage would cause the NAV attributable to our common stock to decline more than it otherwise would have had we not utilized leverage. Similarly, any decrease in our revenue would cause our net income to decline more than it would have had we not borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to make distributions on our common or preferred stock. Our ability to service any debt that we incur depends largely on our financial performance and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures. As noted above, on November 13, 2018 and February 5, 2019, our board of directors, including a required majority (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act), and our stockholders, respectively, approved a reduction of our asset coverage ratio. As a result, since February 5, 2019, the asset coverage requirement applicable to us for senior securities was reduced from 200 to 150 , so long as we comply with the applicable disclosure requirements, which may increase the risk of investing in us. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, our asset coverage ratio, as computed in accordance with the 1940 Act, was 195 and 186 , respectively. Since our leverage, including SBA debentures outstanding, was 105 and 119 of our net assets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, we would have to receive an annual return of at least 2.5 and 2.6 , respectively, to cover annual interest payments. As of September 30, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings of 212.4 million under our Truist Credit Facility, 150.0 million of 2026 Notes and 165.0 million of 2026 Notes-2. Our consolidated debt outstanding was 527.4 million and had a weighted average annual interest rate at the time of 6.0 , exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitment on our Truist Credit Facility. This example is for illustrative purposes only, and actual interest rates on our Truist Credit Facility or any future borrowings are likely to fluctuate. The costs associated with our borrowings, including any increase in the management fee or incentive fee payable to our Investment Adviser, are and will be borne by our common stockholders.)

declarations and payment of distributions to the holders of our common stock and preferred stock, both by the 1940 Act and by requirements imposed by rating agencies, might impair our ability to maintain our qualification as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Changes in laws or regulations governing our operations or those of our portfolio companies may adversely affect our business. 

RISKS RELATING TO THE ILLIQUID NATURE OF OUR PORTFOLIO ASSETS 

RISKS RELATING TO OUR INVESTMENTS 
 assets at the time of a proposed investment, we will be prohibited from making any additional investment that is not a qualifying asset and could be forced to forgo attractive investment opportunities. Similarly, these rules could prevent us from making follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies (which could result in the dilution of our position) or could require us to dispose of investments at inappropriate times in order to comply with the 1940 Act. If we need to dispose of such investments quickly, it would be difficult to dispose of such investments on favorable terms. For example, we may have difficulty in finding a buyer and, even if we do find a buyer, we may have to sell the investments at a substantial loss. Our investment in PSLF, our unconsolidated joint venture with Pantheon, is not a qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. From time to time prior to making additional investments into PSLF, PTSF II or any future joint venture, we may increase our holdings of U.S. treasury securities, cash or cash equivalents (through borrowing or otherwise) so that such investments do not result in less than 70 of our assets being invested in qualifying assets. 

performance, effecting a form of investment leverage on our portfolio. In certain types of derivative transactions, the Company could lose the entire amount of its investment; in other types of derivative transactions the potential loss is theoretically unlimited. Under SEC Rule 18f-4 under the 1940 Act Rule 18f-4 ), related to use of derivatives, short sales, reverse repurchase agreements and certain other transactions by registered investment companies, the Company is permitted to enter into derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations, including short sales, notwithstanding the senior security provision of the 1940 Act if its complies with certain value-at-risk leverage limits and derivatives risk management program and board oversight and reporting requirements or comply with a limited derivatives users exception. Rule 18f-4 also permits the Company to enter into reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions notwithstanding the senior security provision of the 1940 Act if the Company aggregates the amount of indebtedness associated with our reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions with the aggregate amount of any other senior securities representing indebtedness when calculating the asset coverage ratios as discussed herein. In addition, the Company is permitted to invest in a security on a when-issued or forward-settling basis, or with a non-standard settlement cycle, and the transaction will be deemed not to involve a senior security under the 1940 Act, provided that (i) the Company intends to physically settle the transaction and (ii) the transaction will settle within 35 days of its trade date (the Delayed-Settlement Securities Provision ). The Company may otherwise engage in such transaction as a derivatives transaction for purposes of compliance with the rule. Furthermore, the Company is permitted to enter into an unfunded commitment agreement, and such unfunded commitment agreement will not be subject to the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act, if the Company reasonably believes, at the time it enters into such agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all such agreements as they come due. The Company cannot predict the effects of these requirements The Company has adopted updated policies and procedures in compliance with Rule 18f-4. The Company expects to qualify as a limited derivatives user. Future legislation or rules may modify how the Company treats derivatives and other financial arrangements for purposes of the Company s compliance with the leverage limitations of the 1940 Act. Future legislation or rules, may modify how leverage is calculated under the 1940 Act and, therefore, may increase or decrease the amount of leverage currently available to the Company under the 1940 Act, which may be materially adverse to the Company and the Company s Investors. 
 RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK 

issuance of additional shares of our stock, and to amend our charter, without stockholder approval, to increase or decrease the number of shares of stock that we have authority to issue. These anti-takeover provisions may inhibit a change of control in circumstances that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the market price for our common stock. 
 RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR DEBT SECURITIES are not secured by any of our assets or any of the assets of our subsidiaries. As a result, the 2026 Notes and the 2026-2 Notes are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we or our subsidiaries have currently incurred and may incur in the future (or any indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other similar proceeding, the holders of any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries may assert rights against the assets pledged to secure that indebtedness in order to receive full payment of their indebtedness before the assets may be used to pay other creditors, including the holders of the 2026 Notes and the 2026-2 Notes. As of September 30, 2023, we had million in outstanding borrowings under the Truist Credit Facility. The Truist Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets excluding assets held by SBIC II. The indebtedness under the Truist Credit Facility is therefore effectively senior in right of payment to our 2026 Notes and our 2026-2 Notes to the extent of the value of such assets. 
 The 2026 Notes and the 2026-2 Notes are obligations exclusively of PennantPark Investment Corporation and not of any of our subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries is or acts as a guarantor of the 2026 Notes or the 2026-2 Notes and the 2026 Notes and the 2026-2 Notes are not required to be guaranteed by any subsidiaries we may acquire or create in the future. The assets of any such subsidiaries are not directly available to satisfy the claims of our creditors, including holders of our 2026 Notes and our 2026-2 Notes. Except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, all claims of creditors (including holders of preferred stock, if any, of our subsidiaries) will have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including holders of the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2) with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries. Even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries, our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims. Consequently, the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2 are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish as financing vehicles or otherwise. All of such indebtedness is structurally senior to the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2. In addition, our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, all of which would be structurally senior to the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2. The indenture under which each of the 2026 Notes and the 2026-2 Notes were issued contains limited protection for their respective holders. The indenture under which each of the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2 were issued offers limited protection to holders. The terms of the indenture and each of the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2 do not restrict our or any of our subsidiaries ability to engage in, or otherwise be a party to, a variety of corporate transactions, circumstances or events that could have an adverse impact on each holder s investment in the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2. In particular, the terms of the indenture and each of the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2 will not place any restrictions on our or our subsidiaries ability to: issue securities or otherwise incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, including (1) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be equal in right of payment to each of the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2, (2) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be secured and therefore rank effectively senior in right of payment to each of the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2 to the extent of the values of the assets securing such debt, (3) indebtedness of ours that is guaranteed by one or more of our subsidiaries and which therefore would rank structurally senior to each of the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2 and (4) securities, indebtedness or other obligations issued or incurred by our subsidiaries that would be senior in right of payment to our equity interests in our subsidiaries and therefore would rank structurally senior in right of payment to each of the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2 with respect to the assets of our subsidiaries, in each case other than an incurrence of indebtedness or other obligation that would cause a violation of Section 18(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a)(1) and (2) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, as such obligations may be amended or superseded, giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC; 

 pay dividends on, or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of, capital stock or other securities ranking junior in right of payment to the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2; 

 sell assets (other than certain limited restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets); 

 enter into transactions with affiliates; 

 create liens (including liens on the shares of our subsidiaries) or enter into sale and leaseback transactions; 

 make investments; or 

 create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our subsidiaries. 

 In addition, the indenture will not require us to offer to purchase the Notes in connection with a change of control or any other event. Furthermore, the terms of the indenture and each of the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2 do not protect their respective holders in the event that we experience changes (including significant adverse changes) in our financial condition, results of operations or credit ratings, as they do not require that we or our subsidiaries adhere to any financial tests or ratios or specified levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flow or liquidity, except as required under the 1940 Act. Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2 may have important consequences for their holders, including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2 or negatively affecting their trading value. Certain of our current debt instruments include more protections for their respective holders than the indenture and each of the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2. In addition, other debt we issue or incur in the future could contain more protections for its holders than the indenture and each of the 2026 Notes, including additional covenants and events of default. The issuance or incurrence of any such debt with incremental protections could affect the market for and trading levels and prices of the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2, if any. The optional redemption provision may materially adversely affect your return on the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2. The 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2 may be redeemable in whole or in part upon certain conditions at any time, or from time to time, at our option on or after October 15, 2026 or February 1, 2026, respectively. We may choose to redeem the 2026 Notes or the 2026 Notes-2 at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on the Notes. In this circumstance, you may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the 2026 Notes or the 2026 Notes-2 being redeemed. There is no active trading market for the Notes. If an active trading market does not develop for the Notes, you may not be able to sell them. The Notes are a new issue of debt securities for which currently there is no trading market. We do not intend to list the Notes on any securities exchange or for quotation of the Notes on any automated dealer quotation system. If the Notes are traded after their initial issuance, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our credit ratings, general economic conditions, our financial condition, performance and prospects and other factors. The underwriters have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The underwriters may discontinue any market-making in the Notes at any time at their sole discretion. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the price you receive when you sell will be favorable. To the extent an active trading market does not develop, the liquidity and trading price for the Notes may be harmed. Accordingly, you may be required to bear the financial risk of an investment in the Notes for an indefinite period of time. If we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the 2026 Notes or the 2026 Notes-2. Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under our Truist Credit Facility or under other indebtedness to which we may be a party that is not waived by the required lenders or holders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could make us unable to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on the 2026 Notes or the 2026 Notes-2 and substantially decrease the market value of such notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our Truist Credit Facility or other debt we may incur in the future could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to seek to obtain waivers from the required lenders under the agreements relating to our Truist Credit Facility or other debt that we may incur in the future to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our Truist Credit Facility or other debt and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or holders. If this occurs, we would be in default and our lenders or debt holders could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we are unable to repay debt, lenders having secured obligations, including the lenders under our Truist Credit Facility, could proceed against the collateral securing the debt. Because our Truist Credit Facility have, and any future debt will likely have, customary cross-default provisions, if the indebtedness thereunder or under any future credit facility is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due. FATCA withholding may apply to payments to certain foreign entities. Payments made under the 2026 Notes or the 2026 Notes-2 to a foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity (including such an institution or entity acting as an intermediary) may be subject to a U.S. withholding tax of 30 under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (commonly known as FATCA provisions of the Code. This U.S. withholding tax may apply to certain payments of interest on the 2026 Notes or the 2026 Notes-2 as well as scheduled payments of principal, early redemption, or sale of the 2026 Notes or the 2026 Notes-2, unless the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity complies with certain information reporting, withholding, identification, certification and related requirements imposed by FATCA. Depending upon the status of a holder and the status of an intermediary through which any notes are held, the holder could be subject to this 30 U.S. withholding tax in respect of any interest paid on the notes as well as any proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the notes. Proposed Treasury Regulations, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the application of this 30 U.S. withholding tax in respect of payments of certain gross proceeds. Pursuant to these proposed Treasury Regulations, we and any other applicable withholding agent may (but are not required to) rely on this proposed change to FATCA withholding until final regulations are issued or until such proposed Treasury Regulations are rescinded. Holders of the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes-2 should consult their own tax advisors regarding FATCA and how it may affect their investment in the notes. 
 GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 Although we assess our portfolio companies banking relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our and our portfolio companies access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our respective current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect us or our portfolio companies, the financial institutions with which we or our portfolio companies have arrangements directly, or the financial services industry or economy in general. These factors could include, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for companies in the financial services industry. These factors could involve financial institutions or financial services industry companies with which we or our portfolio companies have financial or business relationships, but could also include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry generally. In addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us or our portfolio companies to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all.

 Shares of BDCs may trade at a market price both above and below the NAV that is attributable to those shares. During the periods covered in the above table, our shares have traded below our NAV. Our shares closed on the New York Stock Exchange at and as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our NAV per share was and as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The possibility that our shares of common stock will trade at a discount from NAV or at a premium that is unsustainable over the long term is separate and distinct from the risk that our NAV will decrease. It is not possible to predict whether our shares will trade at, above or below our NAV in the future. As of September 30, 2023 , we had seven stockholders of record. 

 Sale of Unregistered Securities 
 We did not engage in any sales of unregistered securities during the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2023, we did not make any repurchase of our common shares. On February 9, 2022, we announced a share repurchase program which allows us to repurchase up to 25 million of our outstanding common stock in the open market at prices below our net asset value as reported in our then most recently published consolidated financial statements.

DISTRIBUTIONS 
 We intend to continue making distributions to our stockholders. The timing and amount of our distributions, if any, is determined by our board of directors. Any distributions to our stockholders are declared out of assets legally available for distribution. We monitor available net taxable investment income to determine if a tax return of capital may occur for the fiscal year. To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed to be a tax return of capital to our common stockholders. 
 
 In January 2024, a Form 1099-DIV will be sent to stockholders subject to information reporting that will state the amount and composition of distributions and provide information with respect to appropriate tax treatment of our distributions. 
 The tax characteristics of distributions declared, in accordance with Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act, during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 from ordinary income (including short-term gains), if any, totaled 49.6 million and 36.6 million, or 0.76 and 0.56 per share, respectively, based on the weighted average shares outstanding for the respective years. Additionally, for both years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we did not pay any distribution from long-term capital gains. 
 We maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a dividend or other distribution, then stockholders cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash distributions. 
 We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage ratio for borrowings when applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain minimum percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level. 
 Stock Performance Graph 
 This graph compares the return on our common stock with that of the Standard Poor s 500 Stock Index (the S P Index and the Russell 2000 Financial Services Index, for the last five fiscal years. The graph assumes that, on September 30, 2018, a person invested 100 in each of our common stock, the S P 500 Index, and the Russell 2000 Financial Services Index. The graph measures total stockholder return, which takes into account both changes in stock price and distributions. It assumes that distributions paid are invested in like securities. 
 
 The graph and other information furnished under this Part II Item 5 of this Report shall not be deemed to be soliciting material or to be filed with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C, or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act. The stock price performance included in the above graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

This example and the expenses in the table above should not be considered a representation of our future expenses. Actual expenses may be greater or less than those assumed. The table above is provided to assist you in understanding the various costs and expenses that an investor in our common stock will bear directly or indirectly. While the example assumes, as required by the SEC, a 5 annual return, our performance will vary and may result in a return greater or less than 5 . If we were to earn an annual return equal to or less than 5 from net investment income, the incentive fee under our Investment Management Agreement would not be earned or payable. If returns on our investments, including realized capital gains, result in an incentive fee, our expenses, and returns to investors, would be higher. The example assumes that all distributions are reinvested at NAV. Reinvestment of distributions under our dividend reinvestment plan may occur at a price per share that differs from NAV. See Distributions for more information.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Report, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements, which relate to us and our consolidated subsidiaries regarding future events or our future performance or future financial condition. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our Company, our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. The forward-looking statements contained in this Report involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to: 
 our future operating results; 

our business prospects and the prospects of our prospective portfolio companies; 

changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets that could result in changes to the value of our assets; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; 

the impact of a protracted decline in the liquidity of credit markets on our business; 

the impact of investments that we expect to make; 

the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our business and our portfolio companies; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

the valuation of our investments in portfolio companies, particularly those having no liquid trading market; 

the ability of our prospective portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

our expected financings and investments; 

the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; 

the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our prospective portfolio companies; 

the impact of price and volume fluctuations in the stock market; 

increasing levels of inflation, and its impact on us and our portfolio companies; 

the ability of our Investment Adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 

the impact of future legislation and regulation on our business and our portfolio companies; 

the impact of the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and other world economic and political issues; and 

the inability to develop and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. 

We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, intends, seeks, plans, estimates and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. You should not place undue influence on the forward-looking statements as our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Report. 
 Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and, as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate new loans and investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward- looking statement in this Report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. 
 We have based the forward-looking statements included in this Report on information available to us on the date of this Report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in this Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including reports on Form 10-Q/K and current reports on Form 8-K. 
 You should understand that under Section 27A(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 do not apply to forward-looking statements made in periodic reports we file under the Exchange Act. 
 The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. 
 Overview 
 characteristics. Our debt investments may generally range in maturity from three to ten years and are made to U.S. and, to a limited extent, non-U.S. corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions. Our investment activity depends on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital a vailable to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives. 

 Organization and Structure of PennantPark Investment Corporation 
 PennantPark Investment Corporation, a Maryland corporation organized in January 2007, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. 
 SBIC II, our wholly-owned subsidiary, was organized as a Delaware limited partnership in 2012. SBIC II received a license from the SBA to operate as a SBIC under Section 301(c) of the 1958 Act. SBIC II s objectives were to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments generally by investing with us in SBA eligible businesses that meet the investment selection criteria used by PennantPark Investment. We have repaid all outstanding debentures in connection with SBIC II, have surrendered our SBA license and filed a certificates of termination. 
 Our investment activities are managed by the Investment Adviser. Under our Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay our Investment Adviser an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. PennantPark Investment, through the Investment Adviser, had provided similar services to SBIC II under its investment management agreement. SBIC II s investment management agreement has no effect the management and incentive fees on a consolidated basis. We have also entered into an Administration Agreement with the Administrator. Under our Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Counsel and their respective staffs. PennantPark Investment, through the Administrator, has provided similar services to SBIC II under its administration agreement with us. Our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of us, provides overall supervision of our activities, and the Investment Adviser supervises our day-to-day activities. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities we hold and capital gains and dividends, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments, whether in the form of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt or subordinated debt, typically have a term of three to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or a floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments and PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of amendment, commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees. Loan origination fees, OID and market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on liabilities, which we do not fair value, are capitalized and accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as interest expense. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include interest expense on the outstanding debt and unused commitment fees on undrawn amounts, under our various debt facilities, the payment of a management fee and the payment of an incentive fee to our Investment Adviser, if any, our allocable portion of overhead under our Administration Agreement and other operating costs as detailed below. Our management fee compensates our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, consummating and monitoring our investments. We bear all other direct or indirect costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including: 
 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; 

the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities; 

fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments or complementary businesses; 

expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser in performing due diligence and reviews of investments; including expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser payable to third parties (including agents and consultants) in monitoring financial and legal affairs for the Company and in monitoring the Company's investments; 

transfer agent and custodial fees; 

fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 

federal and state registration fees and any exchange listing fees; 

federal, state, local and foreign taxes; 

independent directors fees and expenses; 

brokerage commissions; 

fidelity bond, directors and officers, errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; 

direct costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; 

fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs; 

costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act, the 1958 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws; and 

all other expenses incurred by either the Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under our Administration Agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead, and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under our 

44 

Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Counsel and their respective staffs. 

Generally, during periods of asset growth, we expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets and increase during periods of asset declines. Incentive fees, interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities would be additive to the expenses described above. 
 Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statement 
 During the preparation of the financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023, Management identified an error in the classification and presentation of cash pertaining to the Company's affiliates - PSLF and PTSF II in the September 30, 2022 financial statements. The Company recorded cash activity and due to affiliates pertaining to their investments as a reduction of the cash account instead of presenting the related cash and cash equivalents as an asset and a due to affiliates as a liability. The impact of the error correction is reflected in a 2.1 million increase in cash and cash equivalents and offsetting increase in due to affiliates on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and an increase in due to affiliates within operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows totaling 2.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. There was no impact to the statements of cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2021. There was no impact from the error correction to total net assets and net asset value per share as reported on the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2022. In addition, there was no impact from the error correction on net investment income or net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. The corrections were reported in the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 As a result of the error in the classification and presentation of cash described above, we conducted an analysis to determine whether incentive-based compensation was erroneously awarded, thereby necessitating recovery under the Clawback Policy we adopted effective December 1, 2023. Because we do not pay or otherwise award incentive-based compensation too the Company's executives, we concluded that error did not result in erroneously-awarded incentive-based compensation, and therefore no compensation recovery is required.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements have been included. Actual results could differ from these estimates due to changes in the economic and regulatory environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates and assumptions, including the credit worthiness of our portfolio companies. We may reclassify certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. We have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions. References to ASC serve as a single source of accounting literature. Subsequent events are evaluated and disclosed as appropriate for events occurring through the date the Consolidated Financial Statements are issued. In addition to the discussion below, we describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Investment Valuations 
 We expect that there may not be readily available market values for many of the investments which are or will be in our portfolio, and we value such investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process, as described in this Report. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that our board of directors may take into account in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate or revise our 
 45 

valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and the difference may be material. 
 Our portfolio generally consists of illiquid securities, including debt and equity investments. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 (1) Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our Investment Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment; 

(2) Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the management of the Investment Adviser; 

(3) Our board of directors also engages independent valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment. The independent valuation firms review management s preliminary valuations in light of their own independent assessment and also in light of any market quotations obtained from an independent pricing service, broker, dealer or market maker; 

(4) The audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of the Investment Adviser and those of the independent valuation firms on a quarterly basis, periodically assesses the valuation methodologies of the independent valuation firms, and responds to and supplements the valuation recommendations of the independent valuation firms to reflect any comments; and 

(5) Our board of directors discusses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of our Investment Adviser, the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee. 

Our board of directors generally uses market quotations to assess the value of our investments for which market quotations are readily available. We obtain these market values from independent pricing services or at the bid prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers, if available, or otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. The Investment Adviser assesses the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If our board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available. 
 Fair value, as defined under ASC 820, is the price that we would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment or liability. ASC 820 emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available to us on the reporting period date. 
 ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchies: 
 Level 1: Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date. 
 Level 2: Inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term, if applicable, of the financial instrument. 
 Level 3: Inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability because they are based on our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability. 
 A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Generally, most of our investments, our Truist Credit Facility, 2026 Notes and 2026-2 Notes are classified as Level 3. Our 2024 Notes are classified as Level 1, as they were valued using the closing price from the primary exchange. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and those differences may be material. 
 
 On December 3, 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, which establishes an updated regulatory framework for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. The new rule clarifies how fund boards of directors can satisfy their valuation obligations and requires, among other things, the board of directors to periodically assess material valuation risks and take steps to manage those risks. The rule also permit boards of directors, subject to board oversight and certain other conditions, to designate the fund s investment adviser to perform fair value determinations. The new rule went into effect on March 8, 2021 and had a compliance date of September 8, 2022. We came into compliance with Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act before the compliance date. While our board of directors has not elected to designate the Investment Adviser as the valuation designee at this time, we have adopted certain revisions to our valuation policies and procedures in order comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. 
 46 

In addition to using the above inputs to value cash equivalents, investments, our 2026 Notes, 2026-2 Notes and our Truist Credit Facility valuations, we employ the valuation policy approved by our board of directors that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading, in determining fair value. 
 Generally, the carrying value of our consolidated financial liabilities approximates fair value. We have adopted the principles under ASC Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments, or ASC 825-10, which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and made an irrevocable election to apply ASC 825-10 to our Truist Credit Facility. We elected to use the fair value option for the Truist Credit Facility to align the measurement attributes of both our assets and liabilities while mitigating volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes. Due to that election and in accordance with GAAP, we incurred expenses of zero, 5.1 million, and zero relating to amendment costs on the Truist Credit Facility during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. ASC 825-10 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect on earnings of a company s choice to use fair value. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Assets, and Liabilities and changes in fair value of the Truist Credit Facility are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We elect not to apply ASC 825-10 to any other financial assets or liabilities, 2026 Notes, and 2026 Notes-2. 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 the Truist Credit Facility had a net change in unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of (3.8) million, 7.5 million and (17.8) million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the net unrealized depreciation on our Truist Credit Facility totaled 5.5 million and 9.2 million. We use a nationally recognized independent valuation service to measure the fair value of our Truist Credit Facility in a manner consistent with the valuation process that the board of directors uses to value our investments. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will generally not accrue PIK interest when the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectable. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt investments if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, OID, market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on liabilities, which we do not fair value, are capitalized and then accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as interest expense. We record prepayment penalties on loans and debt investments as income. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned. 
 Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation 
 We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in fair values of our portfolio investments, and our Truist Credit Facility, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. 
 Foreign Currency Translation 
 Our books and records are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis: 
 1. Fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the applicable period; and 

2. Purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at the exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. 

Although net assets and fair values are presented based on the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, we do not isolate that portion of the results of operations due to changes in foreign exchange rates on investments, other assets and debt from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair values of investments and liabilities held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments and liabilities. 
 Payment-in-Kind, or, PIK Interest 
 We have investments in our portfolio which contain a PIK interest provision. PIK interest is added to the principal balance of the investment and is recorded as income. In order for us to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, substantially all of this income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, even though we may not have collected any cash with respect to interest on PIK securities. 
 Federal Income Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually to maintain our election to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC tax election, we must, among other requirements, meet certain annual source-of-income and quarterly asset diversification requirements. We also must annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders out of the assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of the sum of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, or investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. 
 Although not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4 nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends for federal income tax purposes to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of our net ordinary income (subject to certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of the excess, if any, of our capital gains over our capital losses, or capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year plus (3) the sum of any net ordinary income plus capital gain net income for preceding years that was realized but not distributed during such years and on which we did not incur any U.S. federal income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. In addition, although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above, we have retained and may continue to retain such net capital gains or investment company taxable income, contingent on maintaining our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, in order to provide us with additional liquidity. 
 
 Because federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and net realized gain recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences between tax regulations and GAAP may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect their appropriate tax character. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. 
 
 47 

For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded a provision for taxes on net investment income of 4.3 million, 0.8 million and 0.6 million, respectively, pertaining to federal excise tax. 
 
 The Taxable Subsidiary (PNNT Investment Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. The income tax expense and related tax liabilities of the Taxable Subsidiary are reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 the Company recognized a provision for taxes of 5.0 million, 6.2 million, and zero respectively, on net realized gain on investments by the Taxable Subsidiary. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 the Company recognized a provision for taxes of (1.6) million, 0.9 million and zero, respectively, on net unrealized gain on investments by the Taxable Subsidiary. The provision for taxes on net realized and unrealized gains on investments is the result of netting (i) the expected tax liability on the gains from the sales of investments which were realized and unrealized during the fiscal year and (ii) the expected tax benefit resulting from the use of loss carryforwards to offset such gains. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 the Company paid zero, 4.0 million, and zero respectively, in federal taxes on realized gains on the sale of investments held by the Taxable Subsidiary. The state and local tax liability of 3.3 million as of September 30, 2023 is included under accrued other expenses in the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities. 
 
 The Taxable Subsidiary, which is subject to tax as a corporation, allows us to hold equity securities of certain portfolio companies treated as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes while facilitating our ability to qualify as a RIC under the Code.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Set forth below are the results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. For information regarding results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2021, see the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC on November 17, 2022. 
 Investment Income 
 Investment income for the year ended September 30, 2023 was 145.4 million and was attributable to 97.2 million from first lien secured debt, 13.8 million from second lien secured debt and 4.7 million from subordinated debt and 29.7 from preferred and common equity. The increase in investment income compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to an increase in SOFR base rates. 
 Investment income for the year ended September 30, 2022 was 105.0 million and was attributable to 74.4 million from first lien secured debt, 17.0 million from second lien secured debt and 3.7 million from subordinated debt and 9.9 million from preferred and common equity. 
 Expenses 
 Net expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023 totaled 79.8 million. Base management fee for the same period totaled 16.5 million, incentive fee totaled 13.9 million, debt related interest and other financing expenses totaled 39.4 million and general and administrative expenses totaled 5.7 million and provision for taxes and totaled 4.3 million. The increase in expenses over the prior year was primarily due to an increase in debt related interest and other financing expenses and an increase in incentive fees. 
 Net expenses for the year ended September 30, 2022 totaled 61.0 million. Base management fee for the same period totaled 19.8 million, incentive fee totaled 2.7 million, debt related interest and other financing expenses totaled 33.8 million (including one-time debt related costs of 5.1 million) and general and administrative expenses totaled 3.9 million. 
 Net Investment Income 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 net investment income totaled 65.5 million, or 1.00 per share, and 43.9 million, or 0.66 per share, respectively. The increase in net investment income per share compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in investment income. 
 Net Realized Gains or Losses 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 net realized gain (loss) totaled (156.8) million and 34.8 million, respectively. The change in realized gains/losses was primarily due to changes in market conditions of our investments and the values at which they were realized, primarily due to the realization of RAM Energy Holdings LLC, and the fluctuations in the market and in the economy, as discussed above under Forward-Looking Statements . 
 Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments and Debt 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we reported net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments of 59.6 million and (110.0) million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, our net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments totaled (16.3) million and (75.7) million, respectively. The net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on our investments for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital market conditions of our investments and the values at which they were realized, as well as due to the realization of RAM Energy Holdings LLC and the fluctuation in the market and in the economy, as discussed above under the Forward-Looking Statements section above. 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we reported a net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in our Truist Credit Facility of (3.8) million and 7.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, our net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our Truist Credit Facility totaled 5.5 million and 9.2 million, respectively. The net change in unrealized depreciation for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital markets, as further discussed above under Forward-Looking Statements . 
 Net Change in Net Assets Resulting From Operations 
 Net change in net assets resulting from operations totaled (33.8) million, or (0.52) per share, and (24.7) million, or (0.37) per share, for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in net assets from operations for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the prior year was primarily due to depreciation of the portfolio primarily driven by changes in market conditions, as discussed above under Forward-Looking Statements . 
 49 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds of securities offerings, debt capital and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of interest expense, fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives. As of September 30, 2023, in accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that we are in compliance with a 150 asset coverage ratio requirement after such borrowing, excluding SBA debentures pursuant to exemptive relief from the SEC received in June 2011. This Liquidity and Capital Resources section should be read in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements section above. 
 On February 5, 2019, our stockholders approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (which includes the SBCAA) as approved by our board of directors on November 13, 2018. As a result, the asset coverage requirement applicable to us for senior securities was reduced from 200 (i.e., 1 of debt outstanding for each 1 of equity) to 150 (i.e., 2 of debt outstanding for each 1 of equity), subject to compliance with certain disclosure requirements. 
 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, our asset coverage ratio, as computed in accordance with the 1940 Act, was 195 and 186 , respectively. 
 The annualized weighted average cost of debt for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, inclusive of the fee on the undrawn commitment and amendment costs on the Truist Credit Facility, was 6.0 and 4.8 , respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had the multi-currency Truist Credit Facility for up to 475.0 million (decreased from 500.0 million in September 2023), which may be further increased up to 750.0 million in borrowings with certain lenders and Truist Bank (formerly SunTrust Bank), acting as administrative agent, Regions Bank, acting as an additional multicurrency lender, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting as syndication agent for the lenders. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had 212.4 million and 385.9 million, respectively, in outstanding borrowings under the Truist Credit Facility. The Truist Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 7.7 and 5.3 , respectively, exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitments, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022. The Truist Credit Facility is a revolving facility with a stated maturity date of July 29, 2027 for 475.0 million of commitment and the related obligations maturing on September 4, 2024) and pricing set at 235 basis points over SOFR. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had 262.6 million and 114.1 million of unused borrowing capacity under the Truist Credit Facility, respectively, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. The Truist Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets excluding assets held by SBIC II. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with the terms of the Truist Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2023 , we had in aggregate principal amount of outstanding, respectively. The 2024 Notes were redeemed on November 13, 2021 at a redemption price of 25.00 per 2024 Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest to November 13, 2021, pursuant to the indenture governing the 2024 Notes. 
 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding. As of September 30, 2023 , we had million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding. 

 We may raise additional equity or debt capital through both registered offerings off our shelf registration statement and private offerings of securities, by securitizing a portion of our investments, among other sources. Any future additional debt capital we incur, to the extent it is available, may be issued at a higher cost and on less favorable terms and conditions than the Truist Credit Facility, 2026 Notes, and 2026 Notes-2. Furthermore, the Truist Credit Facility availability depends on various covenants and restrictions. The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for repayment of indebtedness, investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders or for other general corporate or strategic purposes such as stock repurchase program. 
 We have entered into certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under our Investment Management Agreement, which was reapproved by our board of directors (including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser) in February 2023 PennantPark Investment Advisers serves as our investment adviser. Payments under our Investment Management Agreement in each reporting period are equal to (1) a management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our average adjusted gross assets and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance. 
 Under our Administration Agreement, which was most recently reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us, in February 2023, the administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. If requested to provide significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, we or the Administrator will be paid an additional amount based on the services provided. Payment under our Administration Agreement is based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator s overhead in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Counsel and their respective staffs. 
 If any of our contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under new agreements that we enter into may increase. In addition, we will likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Investment Management Agreement and our Administration Agreement. Any new investment management agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders. 
 
 SBIC II was previously able to borrow funds from the SBA against regulatory capital (which approximates equity capital) that is paid-in and is subject to customary regulatory requirements including an examination by the SBA. We previously funded SBIC II with 75.0 million of equity capital and it had SBA debentures outstanding of zero and 20.0 million, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The SBA debentures were non-recourse to us and could be prepaid at any time without penalty. We repaid the remaining 20.0 million SBA debentures during the nine months ended June 30, 2023. The interest rate of SBA debentures is fixed at the time of issuance, often referred to as pooling, at a market-driven spread over 10-year U.S. Treasury Notes. Under current SBA regulation, an SBIC may individually borrow up to a maximum of 175.0 million, which is up to twice its potential regulatory capital, and as part of a group of SBICs under common control may borrow a maximum of 350 million in the aggregate. 

50 

As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, SBIC II had zero and 20.0 million in debt commitments, respectively, all of which was drawn as of September 30, 2022. We repaid the remaining 20.0 million SBA debentures during the nine months ended June 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the unamortized fees on the SBA debentures were zero and 0.3 million, respectively. The SBA debentures upfront fees of 3.4 consist of a commitment fee of 1.0 and an issuance discount of 2.4 , which are being amortized. 
 Our fixed-rate SBA debentures were as follows: 

Issuance Dates 
 
 Maturity 
 
 Fixed All-in Coupon Rate (1) 

As of September 30, 2022 Principal Balance 

September 20, 2017 
 
 September 1, 2027 

2.9 

20,000,000 

(1) Excluding 3.4 of upfront fees. 

The SBIC program was designed to stimulate the flow of capital into eligible businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBIC II was historically subject to regulatory requirements, including making investments in SBA eligible businesses, investing at least 25 of regulatory capital in eligible smaller businesses, as defined under the 1958 Act, placing certain limitations on the financing terms of investments, prohibiting investment in certain industries and requiring capitalization thresholds that limit distributions to us, and are subject to periodic audits and examinations of their financial statements that are prepared on a basis of accounting other than GAAP (for example, fair value, as defined under ASC 820, is not required to be used for assets or liabilities for such compliance reporting). 
 
 In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, PennantPark Investment is only allowed to borrow amounts such that our required 150 asset coverage ratio is met after such borrowing. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we excluded the principal amounts of our SBA debentures from our asset coverage ratio pursuant to SEC exemptive relief. In 2011, we received exemptive relief from the SEC allowing us to modify the asset coverage ratio requirement to exclude the SBA debentures from the calculation. Accordingly, our ratio of total assets on a consolidated basis to outstanding indebtedness may be less than 150 which, while providing increased investment flexibility, also increases our exposure to risks associated with leverage. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of 38.8 million and 54.8 million, respectively, available for investing and general corporate purposes. We believe our liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to allow us to effectively operate our business. 
 Our operating activities provided cash of 222.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, and our financing activities used cash of 239.2 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for our investment activities and our financing activities used cash primarily from repayments under our Truist Credit Facility. 
 Our operating activities used cash of 17.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, and our financing activities provided cash of 52.0 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for our investment activities and our financing activities provided cash primarily from the issuance of our 2026-2 Notes and net repayments under our Truist Credit Facility and repayment of our SBA debentures.

PennantPark Senior Loan Fund, LLC 
 In July 2020, we and Pantheon formed PSLF, an unconsolidated joint venture. PSLF invests primarily in middle-market and other corporate debt securities consistent with our strategy. PSLF was formed as a Delaware limited liability company. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022 PSLF had total assets of 872.8 million and 781.3 million, respectively. PSLF s portfolio consisted of debt investments in 90 and 80 portfolio companies as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of the same dates, we and Pantheon had remaining commitments to fund first lien secured debt of 22.4 million and 46.1 million, respectively, and equity interests of 14.5 million and 29.9 million, respectively, in PSLF. As of September 30, 2023, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSLF was 19.7 million and the five largest investments totaled 97.5 million. As of September 30, 2022 at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSLF was 19.9 million and the five largest investments totaled 98.5 million. PSLF invests in portfolio companies in the same industries in which we may directly invest. 
 We provide capital to PSLF in the form of subordinated notes and equity interests. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we and Pantheon owned 60.5 and 39.5 , respectively, of each of the outstanding subordinated notes and equity interests of PSLF. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, our investment in PSLF consisted of subordinated notes of 102.3 million and 88.0 million, respectively, and equity interests of 58.6 million and 51.1 million, respectively. 
 We and Pantheon each appointed two members to PSLF s four-person Member Designees Committee, or the Member Designees Committee. All material decisions with respect to PSLF, including those involving its investment portfolio, require unanimous approval of quorum of the Member Designees Committee. Quorum is defined as (i) the presence of two members of the Member Designees Committee; provided that at least one individual is present that was elected, designated or appointed by each of us and Pantheon; (ii) the presence of three members of the Member Designees Committee, provided that the individual that was elected, designated or appointed by each of us or Pantheon, as the case may be, with only one individual present shall be entitled to cast two votes on each matter; and (iii) the presence of four members of the Member Designees Committee shall constitute a quorum, provided that two individuals are present that were elected, designated or appointed by each of us and Pantheon. 
 
 Additionally, PSLF, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, or PSLF Subsidiary, has entered into a 325 million (increased from 225.0 million on September 2, 2022) senior secured revolving credit facility which bears interest at SOFR (or an alternative risk-free interest rate index) plus 260 basis points during the investment period, or the PSLF Credit Facility, with BNP Paribas, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. 
 In March 2022, PSLF completed a 304.0 million debt securitization in the form of a collateralized loan obligation, or the 2034 Asset-Backed Debt . The 2034 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by a diversified portfolio of PennantPark CLO IV, LLC., a wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary of PSLF, consisting primarily of middle market loans and participation interests in middle market loans. The 2034 Asset-Backed Debt is scheduled to mature in April 2034. On the closing date of the transaction, in consideration of PSLF s transfer to PennantPark CLO IV, LLC. of the initial closing date loan portfolio, which included loans distributed to PSLF by certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries and us, PennantPark CLO IV, LLC transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary of PSLF 100 of the Subordinated Notes issued by PennantPark CLO IV, LLC. 
 On July 26, 2023, CLO VII completed a 300 million debt securitization in the form of a collateralized loan obligation (the 2035 Debt Securitization or 2035 Asset-Backed Debt ). The 2035 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of middle market loans. The 2035 Debt Securitization was executed through a private placement of: (i) 151.0 million Class A-1a Notes maturing 2035, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 2.7 , (ii) 20.0 million Class A-1b Loans 2035, which bear interest at 6.5 , (iii) 12.0 million Class A-2 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2035, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 3.2 , (iv) 21.0 million Class B Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2035, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 4.1 , (v) 24.0 million Class C Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2035, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 4.7 , (vi) 18.0 million Class D Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2035, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 7.0 . As of September 30, 2023 there was 246.0 million of external 2035 Asset-Backed Debt and there was 2.3 million of un-amortized financing costs. As of September 30, 2023 the weighted average interest rate was 8.6 .

The spread may change based on the type of rate used. The terms in the Schedule of Investments disclose the actual interest rate in effect as of the reporting period. LIBOR loans are typically indexed to a 30-day, 60-day, 90-day or 180-day LIBOR rate (1M L, 2M L, 3M L, or 6M L, respectively), at the borrower s option. All securities are subject to a LIBOR or Prime rate floor where a spread is provided, unless noted. The spread provided includes PIK interest and other fee rates, if any. 

(2) Valued based on PSLF s accounting policy. 

(3) Represents the puchase of a security with delayed settlement or a revolving line of credit that is currently an unfunded investment. This secuirty does not earn a basis point spread above an index while it is unfunded.

 Distributions 
 In order to be treated as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and to not be subject to corporate-level tax on undistributed income or gains, we are required, under Subchapter M of the Code, to annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders out of the assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. 
 Although not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year an amount at least equal to the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. In addition, although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above, we have retained and may continue to retain such net capital gains or investment company taxable income, contingent on our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, in order to provide us with additional liquidity. 
 During the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we declared distributions of 0.76 per share and 0.56 per share, respectively, for total distributions of 49.6 million and 36.6 million. We monitor available net income to determine if a return of capital for tax purposes may occur for the fiscal year. To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year, stockholders will be notified of the portion of those distributions deemed to be a tax return of capital. Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders subject to information reporting on Form 1099-DIV after the end of each calendar year and in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. 
 We intend to make monthly distributions to our stockholders. Our monthly distributions, if any, are determined by our board of directors. 
 We maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash distributions. 
 58 

We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage ratio for borrowings applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and/or due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute at least a certain percentage of our income annually, we could suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions at a particular level. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 In March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through September 30, 2023. The FASB approved an (optional) two year extension to December 31, 2024, for transitioning away from LIBOR. The Company utilized the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the year ended September 30, 2023, the effect of which was not material to the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereo. 
 
 In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which is intended to address issues identified during the post-implementation review of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The amendment, among other things, eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors , while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company has adopted the new accounting standard implementing appropriate controls and procedures, the effect of which was not material to the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. 
 
 In June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-03, or ASU, 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, or ASU 2022-03, which changed the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. The amendments clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements, but the impact of the adoption is not expected to be material. 
 Item 7A.	Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2023, our debt portfolio consisted of 95 variable-rate investments and 5 fixed-rate investments. The variable-rate loans are usually based on a SOFR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) rate and typically have durations of three months after which they reset to current market interest rates. Variable-rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to nine months only if the index exceeds the floor. In regards to variable-rate instruments with a floor, we do not benefit from increases in interest rates until such rates exceed the floor and thereafter benefit from market rates above any such floor. In contrast, our cost of funds, to the extent it is not fixed, will fluctuate with changes in interest rates since it has no floor. 
 Assuming that the most recent Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities was to remain constant, and no actions were taken to alter the interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates: 

Change in Interest Rates 
 
 Change in Interest Income, Net of Interest Expense (in thousands) 

Change in Interest Income, Net of Interest Expense Per Share 

Down 1 

(5,373) 

(0.08) 

Up 1 

5,373 

0.08 

Up 2

Up 3 

16,120 

0.25 

Up 4 

21,497 

0.33 

Although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net investment income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from those shown above. 
 Because we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds as well as our level of leverage. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income or net assets. 
 We may hedge against interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts or our Truist Credit Facility subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currencies, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates or higher exchange rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates or investments denominated in foreign currencies. During the periods covered by this Report, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities or foreign currency derivatives hedging activities.

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The management of PennantPark Investment Corporation (except where the context suggests otherwise, the terms we, us, our and PennantPark Investment refer to PennantPark Investment Corporation and its Subsidiaries) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. Our internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
 PennantPark Investment s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions recorded necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our policies and procedures also provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of PennantPark Investment, and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of PennantPark Investment s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on such assessment management has determined that, as of September 30, 2023, we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting due to the material weakness described below. 
 A material weakness was identified in our internal control over financial reporting relating to procedures involving the operation of controls related to the review of quarterly cash and investment reconciliations. Additionally, a material weakness was identified in the operation of our internal controls over financial reporting relating to our review of interest income and non-accrual classification of investments. As a result of the material weakness, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our consolidated financial statements included inn this Annual Report on Form 10-Kk did not result in any material misstatements for the periods presented, other than the restatement discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements. If the material weakness are not remediated there is a possibility they could lead to a material misstatement of account balances or disclosures. Accordingly, management has concluded that these control deficiencies constitute a material weakness. 
 Management believes that the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the Company s financial position, results of its operations, changes in net assets and cash flows for the periods presented. We believe that the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are accurate. We have begun the process of, and we are focused on, further enhancing effective internal control measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate these material weaknesses. Our internal control remediation efforts include the following: 
 
 Enhancing existing controls to ensure the appropriate review of the quarterly cash and investment reconciliation and that it is adequately documented so as to provide evidence that the controls are operating effectively; 

Enhancing existing controls to ensure that our internal controls over financial reporting relating to our analysis of interest income and assessment of investments for classification as non-accrual investments are operating effectively; and 

Enhancing policies and procedures to demonstrate a commitment to improving our overall control environment; 

We believe our planned actions to enhance our processes and controls will address these material weaknesses, but these actions are subject to ongoing management evaluation, and we will need a period of execution to demonstrate remediation. We are committed to the continuous improvement of our internal control over financial reporting and will continue to diligently review our internal control over financial reporting. 

PennantPark Investment's independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. This report appears on page 62 .

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
 PennantPark Investment Corporation and its Subsidiaries 

Opinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited PennantPark Investment Corporation and its Subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements) of the Company and our report dated December 7, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and included an emphasis of matter paragraph regarding the information presented in the financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022, that have been restated to reclassify certain amounts presented therein. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management's assessment. Material weaknesses were identified in the operation of controls related to the Company s quarterly review of cash and investment par value and quantity reconciliations, the review of interest income earned, and the review of the non-accrual classification of investments. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023, and this report does not affect our report dated December 7, 2023 on those financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered P ublic Accounting Firm 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
 PennantPark Investment Corporation and its Subsidiaries 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities of PennantPark Investment Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the Company), including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Our report dated December 7, 2023 expressed an opinion that the Company had not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. 
 
 Emphasis of Matter 
 As discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the 2022 financial statements have been restated to reclassify certain amounts presented within. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from brokers were not received. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Level 3 Fair Value Measurements 
 The fair value of the Company s investments valued using Level 3 fair value measurements was approximately 927.3 million as of September 30, 2023. The fair value of the Company s financial instruments classified as liabilities valued using Level 3 fair value measurements was approximately 206.9 million as of September 30, 2023. As discussed in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s investment portfolio generally consists of illiquid securities, including debt and equity investments, which were acquired directly from the issuer. Such investments include first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments. Additionally, the Company has elected to apply the fair value option to certain financial instruments classified as liabilities. The inputs into the determination of fair value required significant management judgment or estimation. 
 
 We identified Level 3 fair value measurements as a critical audit matter due to the subjective nature of the judgments necessary for management to select valuation techniques and the use of significant unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value. Auditing the reasonableness of management s selection of valuation technique and the related unobservable inputs required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort, including the use of a valuation specialist. 

63 

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following, among others: 
 
 We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to management s valuation of Level 3 fair value measurements, including those related to valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness. 

With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of the selected valuation techniques, and any changes to selected valuation techniques from prior periods, used for Level 3 fair value measurements. For a sample of investments, we evaluated both the reasonableness of the significant unobservable inputs and the reasonableness of any significant changes in significant unobservable inputs from prior periods, when applicable, by comparing the unobservable inputs to external sources, including, but not limited to: 

o Historical operating results of the investee. 

o Available market data for comparable companies. 

o Subsequent events and transactions, where available. 

We tested both the source information used to determine the unobservable input and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation used to compute the unobservable input for a sample of investments. 

/s/ 
 
 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2013.

The 2026 Notes mature on and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option subject to a make-whole premium if redeemed more than three months prior to maturity. The 2026 Notes are general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2026 Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. We do not intend to list the 2026 Notes on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system. In October 2021, we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes-2 at a public offering price per note of . Interest on the 2026 Notes is paid on May 1 and November 1 of each year, at a rate of per year, commencing May 1, 2022. The 2026 Notes-2 mature on and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option subject to a make-whole premium if redeemed more than three months prior to maturity. The 2026 Notes-2 are general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2026 Notes-2 are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. We do not intend to list the 2026 Notes-2 on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system. We have formed the Taxable Subsidiary, which is subject to tax as a corporation. The Taxable Subsidiary allows us to hold equity securities of certain portfolio companies treated as pass-through entities for federal income tax purposes while facilitating our ability to qualify as a RIC under the Code. In January 2022, we funded PennantPark-TSO Senior Loan Fund II LP, PTSF II ), an unconsolidated limited partnership, organized as a Delaware limited liability partnership. We sold million in investments to a wholly-owned subsidiary of PTSF II in exchange for cash in the amount of million and an million equity interest in PTSF II representing of the total outstanding Class A Units of PTSF II. We recognized million of realized gain upon the formation of PTSF II. As of September 30, 2023, o ur capital commitment of million is funded and we hold of the total outstanding Class A Units of PTSF II and a voting interest in the general partner which manages PTSF II. We are operated by a person who has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator under the Commodity Exchange Act and the Investment Adviser intends to continue to affirm the exclusion on an annual basis, and therefore, is not subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the Commodity Exchange Act. 

Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statement During the preparation of the financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023, Management identified an error in the classification and presentation of cash pertaining to the Company's affiliates - PSLF and PTSF II in the September 30, 2022 financial statements. The Company recorded cash activity and due to affiliates pertaining to their investments as a reduction of the cash account instead of presenting the related cash and cash equivalents as an asset and a due to affiliates as a liability. The impact of the error correction is reflected in a million increase in cash and cash equivalents and offsetting increase in due to affiliates on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and an increase in due to affiliates within operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows totaling million for the year ended September 30, 2022. There was no impact to the statements of cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2021. There was impact from the error correction to total net assets and net asset value per share as reported on the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2022. In addition, there was impact from the error correction on net investment income or net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. The corrections were reported in the year ended September 30, 2023. Our significant accounting policies consistently applied are as follows: 
 portfolio company on non-accrual, representing and percent of our overall portfolio on a cost and fair value basis, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 , we had portfolio company on non-accrual representing and percent of our overall portfolio on a cost and fair value basis, respectively. 
 million, million and million, respectively, which pertains to U.S. federal excise tax. We recognize the effect of a tax position in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with ASC 740 when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not considered to satisfy the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense or benefit. Penalties or interest, if applicable, that may be assessed relating to income taxes would be classified as other operating expenses in the financial statements. There were no tax accruals relating to uncertain tax positions and no amounts accrued for any related interest or penalties with respect to the periods presented herein. The Company s determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an on-going analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. Although the Company files both federal and state income tax returns, the Company s major tax jurisdiction is federal. The Taxable Subsidiary (PNNT Investment Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company), is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. The income tax expense and related tax liabilities of the Taxable Subsidiary are reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 the Company recognized a provision for taxes of million, million, and , respectively, on net realized gain on investments by the Taxable Subsidiary. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 the Company recognized a provision for taxes of million, million, and , respectively, on net unrealized gain on investments by the Taxable Subsidiary. The provision for taxes on net realized and unrealized gains on investments is the result of netting (i) the expected tax liability on the gains from the sales of investments which were realized and unrealized during fiscal year ending September 30, 2023 and (ii) the expected tax benefit resulting from the use of loss carryforwards to offset such gains. For the year ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 the Company recognized a provision for taxes million, million and , respectively, on net realized and unrealized gains on investments by the Taxable Subsidiary. During the year ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 the Company paid , million, and respectively, in federal taxes on realized gains on the sale of investments held by the Taxable Subsidiary. The state and local tax liability of million as of September 30, 2023 is included under accrued other expenses in the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities. Because U.S. federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions characterized in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and net realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences between tax regulations and GAAP may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect their tax character. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. 

of our average adjusted gross assets, which equals our gross assets (exclusive of U.S. Treasury Bills, temporary draws under any credit facility, cash and cash equivalents, repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions undertaken at the end of a fiscal quarter for purposes of preserving investment flexibility for the next quarter and unfunded commitments, if any) and is payable quarterly in arrears. In addition, to on gross assets that exceed of the Company s total net assets as of the immediately preceding quarter-end. This amendment became effective on February 5, 2019 with the amendment and restatement of the Investment Management Agreement on April 12, 2019. For example, if we sold shares on the 45th day of a quarter and did not use the proceeds from the sale to repay outstanding indebtedness, our gross assets for such quarter would give effect to the net proceeds of the issuance for only 45 days of the quarter during which the additional shares were outstanding. For periods prior to January 1, 2018, the base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of of our average adjusted gross assets. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Investment Adviser earned base management fees of million, million, and million, respectively, from us. Incentive Fee The incentive fee has two parts, as follows: One part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income, including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as amendment, commitment, origination, prepayment penalties, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees received from portfolio companies, accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense or amendment fees under any credit facility and distribution paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero-coupon securities), accrued income not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, computed net of all realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a percentage of the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of per quarter annualized). incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate of , (2) of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than in any calendar quarter annualized), and (3) of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds in any calendar quarter. These calculations are pro-rated for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter, if applicable. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Investment Adviser earned million, million, and million, respectively, in incentive fees on net investment income from us. The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement, as of the termination date) and, effective January 1, 2018, equals of our realized capital gains, for periods prior to January 1, 2018), if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Investment Adviser did not accrue an incentive fee on capital gains as calculated under the Investment Management Agreement (as described above). Under GAAP, we are required to accrue a capital gains incentive fee based upon net realized capital gains and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the capital gains incentive fee accrual, we considered the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Management Agreement. This accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and cumulative unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then we record a capital gains incentive fee equal to of such amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains related to incentive fees paid in all prior years, if any. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such year. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 , the Investment Adviser did t accrue an incentive fee on capital gains as calculated under GAAP. (b) Administration Agreement The Administration Agreement with the Administrator was reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us, in February 2023. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator provides administrative services and office facilities to us. The Administrator has provided similar services to SBIC II under its administration agreement with PennantPark Investment. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for its allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Counsel and their respective staffs. The Administrator also offers, on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies to which we are required to offer such assistance. Reimbursement for certain of these costs is included in administrative services expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we recorded million, million and million, respectively, for services described above. On July 1, 2022, the Administration Agreement with the Administrator was amended to clarify that the Administrator may be reimbursed by the Company for certain (i) tax and general legal advice and/or services provided to the Company by in-house professionals of the Administrator related to ongoing operations of the Company; and (ii) transactional legal advice and/or services provided to the Company or portfolio companies by in-house professionals of the Administrator or its affiliates on matters related to potential or actual investments and transactions, including tax structuring and/or due diligence. (c) Other Related Party Transactions There were no transactions subject to Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act during each of the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we sold million, million, and million in investments to PSLF at fair value, respectively, and recognized million, million and million of net realized loss, respectively. For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we sold and million in investments to PTSF II at fair value, respectively, and recognized zero and million of net realized gains, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022 , PNNT had a payable to PSLF and PTSF II of million and million, respectively, presented as a due to affiliates on the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities. These amounts are related to cash owed to PSLF and PTSF II from PNNT in connection with trades between the funds.

A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Generally, most of our investments, our Truist Credit Facility and our SBA debentures are classified as Level 3. Our 2026 Notes and 2026 Notes-2 are classified as Level 2, as they are financial instruments with readily observable market inputs. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and those differences may be material. The inputs into the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. Even if observable market data is available, such information may be the result of consensus pricing information, disorderly transactions or broker quotes which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing and/or quotes accompanied by disclaimer would result in classification as Level 3 information, assuming no additional corroborating evidence were available. Corroborating evidence that would result in classifying these non-binding broker/dealer bids as a Level 2 asset includes observable orderly market-based transactions for the same or similar assets or other relevant observable market-based inputs that may be used in pricing an asset. Our investments are generally structured as debt and equity investments in the form of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments. The transaction price, excluding transaction costs, is typically the best estimate of fair value at inception. Ongoing reviews by our Investment Adviser and independent valuation firms are based on an assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sale transactions with third parties, expected cash flows and market-based information including comparable transactions, performance multiples and yields, among other factors. These non-public investments valued using unobservable inputs are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. A review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in our ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities. In addition to using the above inputs to value cash equivalents, investments, our SBA debentures, our 2026 Notes, our 2026-2 Notes and our Truist Credit Facility, we employ the valuation policy approved by our board of directors that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading, in determining fair value. See Note 2. As outlined in the table below, some of our Level 3 investments using a market approach valuation technique are valued using the average of the bids from brokers or dealers. The bids include a disclaimer, may not have corroborating evidence, may be the result of a disorderly transaction and may be the result of consensus pricing. The Investment Adviser assesses the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If the board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such bids do not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investment by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available. In accordance with ASC 820, we do not categorize any investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share within the fair value hierarchy. The remainder of our investment portfolio and our long-term Truist Credit Facility are valued using a market comparable or an enterprise market value technique. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that our board of directors may take into account in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the pricing indicated by the external event, excluding transaction costs, is used to corroborate the valuation. When using earnings multiples to value a portfolio company, the multiple used requires the use of judgment and estimates in determining how a market participant would price such an asset. These non-public investments using unobservable inputs are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Generally, the sensitivity of unobservable inputs or combination of inputs such as industry comparable companies, market outlook, consistency, discount rates and reliability of earnings and prospects for growth, or lack thereof, affects the multiple used in pricing an investment. As a result, any change in any one of those factors may have a significant impact on the valuation of an investment. Generally, an increase in a market yield will result in a decrease in the valuation of a debt investment, while a decrease in a market yield will have the opposite effect. Generally, an increase in an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, multiple will result in an increase in the valuation of an investment, while a decrease in an EBITDA multiple will have the opposite effect.

Generally, the carrying value of our consolidated financial liabilities approximates fair value. We have adopted the principles under ASC Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments, or ASC 825-10, which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and made an irrevocable election to apply ASC 825-10 to our Truist Credit Facility. We elected to use the fair value option for the Truist Credit Facility to align the measurement attributes of both our assets and liabilities while mitigating volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes. Due to that election and in accordance with GAAP, we incurred expenses of , million and relating to amendment costs on the Truist Credit Facility during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. ASC 825-10 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect on earnings of a company s choice to use fair value. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and changes in fair value of the Truist Credit Facility are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We did not elect to apply ASC 825-10 to any other financial assets or liabilities, including the 2024 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2026 Notes-2 and the SBA debentures. For the year ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 the Credit Facility had a net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation of million, million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the net unrealized (appreciation) depreciation on Truist Credit Facility totaled million, million, and million, respectively. We use an independent valuation service to measure the fair value of our Truist Credit Facility in a manner consistent with the valuation process that our board of directors uses to value our investments.

, , and , respectively. As of September 30, 2023 , in accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that we are in compliance with the asset coverage ratio requirement after such borrowing, excludi ng SBA debentures, pursuant to exemptive relief from the SEC received in June 2011. On February 5, 2019, our stockholders approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (which includes the Small Business Credit Availability Act, or SBCAA) as approved by our board of directors on November 13, 2018. As a result, the asset coverage requirement applicable to us for senior securities was reduced from (i.e., 1 of debt outstanding for each 1 of equity) to (i.e., 2 of debt outstanding for each 1 of equity), subject to compliance with certain disclosure requirements. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, our asset coverage ratio, as computed in accordance with the 1940 Act, was and , respectively. Truist Credit Facility As of September 30, 2023, we had the multi-currency Truist Credit Facility for up to million (decreased from million in September 2023), which may be further increased up to million in borrowings with certain lenders and Truist Bank (formerly SunTrust Bank), acting as administrative agent, Regions Bank, acting as an additional multicurrency lender, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting as syndication agent for the lenders. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had million and million, respectively, in outstanding borrowings under the Truist Credit Facility. The Truist Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of and , respectively, exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitment, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 . The Truist Credit Facility is a revolving facility with a stated maturity date of for million out of the total million commitments (with the revolving period with respect to the remaining million of commitments expiring on and the related obligations maturing on September 4, 2024) and pricing set at basis points over SOFR. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had million and million of unused borrowing capacity under the Truist Credit Facility, respectively, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. The Truist Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets excluding assets held by SBIC II. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with the terms of the Truist Credit Facility. SBA Debentures SBIC II was historically able to borrow funds from the SBA against regulatory capital (which approximates equity capital) that is paid-in and is subject to customary regulatory requirements including an examination by the SBA. We previously funded SBIC II with million of equity capital and it had SBA debentures outstanding of and million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively. SBA debentures are non-recourse to us and may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA debentures is fixed at the time of issuance, often referred to as pooling, at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes. Under current SBA regulations, a SBIC may individually borrow to a maximum of million, which is up to twice its potential regulatory capital, and as part of a group of SBICs under common control may borrow a maximum of million in the aggregate. As of both September 30, 2023 and 2022 , SBIC II had and million in debt commitments, respectively, all of which was drawn as of September 30, 2022. We repaid the remaining million SBA Debentures during the nine months ended June 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022 , the unamortized fees on the SBA debentures were and million, respectively. The SBA debentures upfront fees of consist of a commitment fee of and an issuance discount of , which are being amortized.

The SBIC program was designed to stimulate the flow of capital into eligible businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBIC II was subject to regulatory requirements, including making investments in SBA eligible businesses, investing at least of regulatory capital in eligible smaller businesses, as defined under the 1958 Act, placing certain limitations on the financing terms of investments, prohibiting investment in certain industries and requiring capitalization thresholds that limit distributions to us, and were subject to periodic audits and examinations of its financial statements that are prepared on a basis of accounting other than GAAP (for example, fair value, as defined under ASC 820, is not required to be used for assets or liabilities for such compliance reporting). 2024 Notes As of September 30, 2023 and 2022 , we had in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes outstanding, respectively. The 2024 Notes were redeemed on November 13, 2021 at a redemption price of per 2024 Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest to November 13, 2021, pursuant to the indenture governing the 2024 Notes. Interest on the 2024 Notes was paid at a rate of per year. 2026 Notes In April 2021, we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes at a public offering price per note of . Interest on the 2026 Notes is paid on May 1 and November 1 of each year, at a rate of per year, commencing November 1, 2021. The 2026 Notes mature on and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option subject to a make-whole premium if redeemed more than three months prior to maturity. The 2026 Notes are general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2026 Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. We do not intend to list the 2026 Notes on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system. 2026 Notes-2 In October 2021, we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes-2 at a public offering price per note of . Interest on the 2026 Notes-2 is paid on May 1 and November 1 of each year, at a rate of per year, commencing May 1, 2022. The 2026 Notes-2 mature on and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option subject to a make-whole premium if redeemed more than three months prior to maturity.

As of September 30, 2023, we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, due to the material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting described in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, which appears on page 61 of this Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Specifically, material weaknesses were identified with respect to (i) the operations of controls relating to the quarterly cash and investment reconciliations and (ii) the operation of our internal controls over financial reporting relating to our review of interest income and non-accrual classification of investments. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
 
 Notwithstanding the material weaknesses referenced above, management believes that the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the Company s financial position, results of its operations, changes in net assets and cash flows for the periods presented. We have begun the process of, and we are focused on, further enhancing effective internal control measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the material weaknesses noted above. Our internal control remediation efforts include the following: 
 
 Enhancing existing controls to ensure the appropriate review of the quarterly cash and investment reconciliation and that it is adequately documented so as to provide evidence that the controls are operating effectively; 

Enhancing existing controls to ensure that our internal controls over financial reporting relating to our analysis of interest income and assessment of investments for classification as non-accrual investments are operating effectively; and 

Enhancing policies and procedures to demonstrate a commitment to improving our overall control environment. 

We believe our planned actions to enhance our processes and controls will address these material weaknesses, but these actions are subject to ongoing management evaluation, and we will need a period of execution to demonstrate remediation. We are committed to the continuous improvement of our internal control over financial reporting and will continue to diligently review our internal control over financial reporting. 
 b) Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, which appears on page 61 of this Form 10-K, is incorporated by reference herein. 
 c) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

As of September 30, 2023, management remediated the material weakness previously identified as of September 30, 2022 relating to procedures to ensure the timely transmission of portfolio company financial information to our independent valuation services providers. Although this material weakness did not result in any material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements, there is possibility it could have led to a material misstatement of account balances or disclosures that were not prevented or detected. 
 
 Management remediated the material weakness by enchancing (a) existing controls to ensure the timely transmission of all relevant portfolio company financial information to our independent valuation service providers and (b) policies and procedures to demonstrate a commitment to improving our overall control environment. 
 
 As a result of the remediation activities, management has determined that management's control were designed appropriately and a sufficient level of precision, and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time, such that the material weakness previously identified as of September 30, 2022 has been remediated as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Except as noted above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Please see Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, which appears on page 61 of this Form 10-K, for descriptions of the material weaknesses identified by Management.

Exhibit 14.1 
 JOINT CODE OF ETHICS FOR PENNANTPARK INVESTMENT CORPORATION PENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD. PENNANTPARK INVESTMENT ADVISERS, LLC 
 Section I Statement of General Fiduciary Principles 
 
 This Joint Code of Ethics (the Code has been adopted by each of PennantPark Investment Corporation, PennantPark Floating Rate Capital, Ltd. (each individually, the Corporation ), and PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC, the Corporations investment adviser (the Adviser ), in compliance with Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Act and Section 204A of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act ). The purpose of the Code is to establish standards and procedures for the detection and prevention of activities by which persons having knowledge of the investments and investment intentions of the Corporations may abuse their fiduciary duty to the Corporations, and otherwise to deal with the types of conflict-of-interest situations to which Rule 17j-1 under the Act Rule 17j-1 is addressed. As it relates to Section 204A of the Advisers Act, the purpose of this Code is to establish procedures that, taking into consideration the nature of the Adviser s business, are reasonably designed to prevent misuse of material non-public information in violation of the federal securities laws by persons associated with the Adviser. 
 
 The Code is based on the principle that the directors and officers of the Corporations, and the managers, partners, officers and employees of the Adviser, who provide services to the Corporations, owe a fiduciary duty to the Corporations to conduct their personal securities transactions in a manner that does not interfere with the Corporations transactions or otherwise take unfair advantage of their relationship with the Corporations. All directors, managers, partners, officers and employees of the Corporations, and the Adviser Covered Personnel are expected to adhere to this general principle as well as to comply with all of the specific provisions of this Code that are applicable to them. Any Covered Personnel who is affiliated with another entity that is a registered investment adviser is, in addition, expected to comply with the provisions of the code of ethics that has been adopted by such other investment adviser. 
 
 Technical compliance with the Code will not automatically insulate any Covered Personnel from scrutiny of transactions that show a pattern of compromise or abuse of the individual s fiduciary duty to the Corporation. Accordingly, all Covered Personnel must seek to avoid any actual or potential conflicts between their personal interests and the interests of the Corporation and its shareholders. In sum, all Covered Personnel shall place the interests of the Corporation before their own personal interests.

Section III Objective and General Prohibitions 
 
 Covered Personnel may not engage in any investment transaction under circumstances in which the Covered Personnel benefits from or interferes with the purchase or sale of investments by the Corporation. In addition, Covered Personnel may not use information concerning the investments or investment intentions of the Corporation, or their ability to influence such investment intentions, for personal gain or in a manner detrimental to the interests of the Corporation. 
 
 Covered Personnel may not engage in conduct that is deceitful, fraudulent or manipulative, or that involves false or misleading statements, in connection with the purchase or sale of investments by the Corporation. In this regard, Covered Personnel should recognize that Rule 17j 1 makes it unlawful for any affiliated person of the Corporation, or any affiliated person of an investment adviser for the Corporation, in connection with the purchase or sale, directly or indirectly, by the person of a Security Held or to be Acquired by the Corporation to: 
 (i) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud the Corporation; 

(ii) make any untrue statement of a material fact to the Corporation or omit to state to the Corporation a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; 

(i) engage in any act, practice or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the Corporation; or 

(ii) engage in any manipulative practice with respect to the Corporation. 

Covered Personnel should also recognize that a violation of this Code or of Rule 17j-1 may result in the imposition of: (1) sanctions as provided by Section VIII of this Code; or (2) administrative, civil and, in certain cases, criminal fines, sanctions or penalties. 
 
 Section IV Pre-Clearance of Personal Account Transactions; Window Period to Trade PennantPark shares 
 
 Except as noted below, all Access Persons must obtain the prior written approval of the Managing Member (or such person as the Managing Member may designate) Approving Officer before engaging in any transaction in his or her Personal Account. The Approving Officer may approve the transaction if he concludes that the transaction would comply with the provisions of this Code and is not likely to have any adverse economic impact on clients. A request for preclearance must be made by email, with a copy to the Compliance Officer, in advance of the contemplated transaction. No particular form is required, but the email must include sufficient detail for the Approving Officer to decide if a trade is permissible and a statement that the Access Person has reviewed the Pipeline Report for any conflicts. 
 Any approval given under this paragraph will be provided by email and will remain in effect for 72 hours. 
 
 Exceptions to the Pre-Clearance Requirement Policy, 
 
 Access Persons will be allowed to trade securities of the Corporations during a window period that may be announced following the release of Corporations earnings release. If the window is opened for trading, it will begin no earlier than the second business day after a Corporation publicly releases quarterly or annual financial results and extends no later than (i) 30 calendar days after the release of results (29 calendar days in all) or (ii) in the case of either Corporation s and the Adviser s decision to buy or sell the applicable Corporation s equity securities, the end of the quarterly period during which such financial results of such Corporation have been publicly released. Note that the ability of an officer, director or other Access Person to engage in transactions in the securities of a Corporation during a window period is not automatic or absolute because no trades may be made even during a window period by an individual who possesses material, nonpublic information about the Corporation, including any decision by the Corporation to buy or sell its own shares. Further, the window period may not open in a particular quarter, and it may be closed, as the case may be, prior to the expiration of 30 days or the applicable quarter end, in each case as events require. 
 
 Additionally, Independent Directors are not required to seek preapproval for any transactions other than those which would trigger reporting requirements as set forth in Section VI (C) of this Code. 

3 

Section V Prohibited Transactions 
 
 A) An Access Person may not purchase or otherwise acquire direct or indirect Beneficial Ownership of any Covered Security on the Restricted List, and may not sell or otherwise dispose of any Covered Security on the Restricted List in which he or she has direct or indirect Beneficial Ownership, if he or she knows or should know at the time of entering into the transaction that: (1) the Corporation has purchased or sold the Covered Security within the last 15 calendar days, or is purchasing or selling or intends to purchase or sell the Covered Security in the next 15 calendar days; or (2) the Adviser has within the last 15 calendar days considered purchasing or selling the Covered Security for the 

Corporation or within the next 15 calendar days intend to consider purchasing or selling the Covered Security for the Corporation. 
 B) Every Advisory Person of the Corporation or the Adviser must obtain approval from the Corporation or the Adviser, as the case may be, before directly or indirectly acquiring Beneficial Ownership in any securities in an Initial Public Offering or in a Limited Offering. Such approval must be obtained from the Chief Compliance Officer, unless he is the person seeking such approval, in which case it must be obtained from the President of the 17j-1 Organization. 

C) No Access Person shall recommend any transaction in any Covered Securities by the Corporation without having disclosed to the Chief Compliance Officer his or her interest, if any, in such Covered Securities or the issuer thereof, including: the Access Person s Beneficial Ownership of any Covered Securities of such issuer; any contemplated transaction by the Access Person in such Covered Securities; any position the Access Person has with such issuer; and any present or proposed business relationship between such issuer and the Access Person (or a party which the Access Person has a significant interest). 

Section VI Reports by Access Persons 
 A) Personal Securities Holdings Reports. 

All Access Persons shall within 10 days of the date on which they become Access Persons, and thereafter, within 30 days after the end of each calendar year, disclose the title, number of shares and principal amount of all Covered Securities in which they have a Beneficial Ownership as of the date the person became an Access Person, in the case of such person s initial report, and as of the last day of the year, as to annual reports. A form of such report, which is hereinafter called a Personal Securities Holdings Report, is attached hereto as Schedule A. Each Personal Securities Holdings Report must also disclose the name of any broker, dealer or bank with whom the Access Person maintained an account in which any securities were held for the direct or indirect benefit of the Access Person as of the date the person became an Access Person or as of the last day of the year, as the case may be. Each Personal Securities Holdings Report shall state the date it is being submitted. 
 B) Quarterly Transaction Reports. 

Within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, each Access Person shall make a written report to the Chief Compliance Officer of all transactions occurring in the quarter in a Covered Security in which he or she had any Beneficial Ownership. A form of such report, which is hereinafter called a Quarterly Securities Transaction Report, is attached hereto as Schedule B. 
 
 A Quarterly Securities Transaction Report shall be in the form of Schedule B or such other form approved by the Chief Compliance Officer and must contain the following information with respect to each reportable transaction: 
 (1) Date and nature of the transaction (purchase, sale or any other type of acquisition or disposition); 

(2) Title, interest rate and maturity date (if applicable), number of shares and principal amount of each Covered Security involved and the price of the Covered Security at which the transaction was effected; 

(3) Name of the broker, dealer or bank with or through whom the transaction was effected; and 

(4) The date the report is submitted by the Access Person. 

(C) Independent Directors. 
 
 Notwithstanding the reporting requirements set forth in this Section V, an Independent Director who would be required to make a report under this Section V solely by reason of being a director of the Corporation is not required to file a Personal Securities Holding Report upon becoming a director of the Corporation or an annual Personal Securities Holding Report. Such an Independent 
 4 

Director also need not file a Quarterly Securities Transaction Report unless such director knew or, in the ordinary course of fulfilling his or her official duties as a director of the Corporation, should have known that during the 15-day period immediately preceding or after the date of the transaction in a Covered Security by the director such Covered Security is or was purchased or sold by the Corporation or the Corporation or the Adviser considered purchasing or selling such Covered Security. 
 
 (D) Access Persons of the Adviser. 
 
 An Access Person of the Adviser need not make a Quarterly Transaction Report if all of the information in the report would duplicate information required to be recorded pursuant to Rules 204-2(a)(12) or (13) under the Advisers Act. 
 
 (E) Brokerage Accounts and Statements. 
 
 Access Persons, except Independent Directors, shall: 
 (1) within 10 days after the end of each calendar quarter, identify the name of the broker, dealer or bank with whom the Access Person established an account in which any securities were held during the quarter for the direct or indirect benefit of the Access Person and identify any new account(s) and the date the account(s) were established. This information shall be included on the appropriate Quarterly Securities Transaction Report. 

(2) instruct the brokers, dealers or banks with whom they maintain such an account to provide duplicate account statements to the Chief Compliance Officer. 

(3) on an annual basis, certify that they have complied with the requirements of (1) and (2) above. 

(F) Form of Reports. 
 
 A Quarterly Securities Transaction Report may consist of broker statements or other statements that provide a list of all personal Covered Securities holdings and transactions in the time period covered by the report and contain the information required in a Quarterly Securities Transaction Report. 
 
 (G) Responsibility to Report. 
 
 It is the responsibility of each Access Person to take the initiative to comply with the requirements of this Section VI. Any effort by the Corporation, or by the Adviser and its affiliates, to facilitate the reporting process does not change or alter that responsibility. A person need not make a report hereunder with respect to transactions effected for, and Covered Securities held in, any account over which the person has no direct or indirect influence or control. 
 H) Where to File Reports. 

All Quarterly Securities Transaction Reports and Personal Securities Holdings Reports must be filed with the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 F) Disclaimers. 

Any report required by this Section VI may contain a statement that the report will not be construed as an admission that the person making the report has any direct or indirect Beneficial Ownership in the Covered, Security to which the report relates. 

5 

Section VII Additional Prohibitions 
 a) Confidentiality of the Corporation s Transactions. 

Until disclosed in a public report to shareholders or to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC in the normal course, all information concerning the securities being considered for purchase or sale by the Corporation shall be kept confidential by all Covered Personnel and disclosed by them only on a need to know basis. It shall be the responsibility of the Chief Compliance Officer to report any inadequacy found in this regard to the directors of the Corporation. 
 b) Outside Business Activities and Directorships. 

Access Persons may not engage in any outside business activities that may give rise to conflicts of interest or jeopardize the integrity or reputation of the Corporation. Similarly, no such outside business activities may be inconsistent with the interests of the Corporation. All directorships of public or private companies held by Access Persons shall be reported to the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 c) Gratuities. 

Covered Personnel shall not, directly or indirectly, take, accept or receive gifts or other consideration in merchandise, services or otherwise of more than nominal value from any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity other than such person s employer that does business, or proposes to do business, with the Corporation. 
 
 Section VIII Prohibition Against Insider Trading 
 
 This Section is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 204A of the Advisers Act, which is applicable to the Adviser and requires that the Adviser establish and enforce procedures designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information by its associated persons. It applies to all Advisory Persons. Trading securities while in possession of material, non-public information, or improperly communicating that information to others, may expose an Advisory 
 
 Person to severe penalties. Criminal sanctions may include a fine of up to 1,000,000 and/or ten years imprisonment. The SEC can recover the profits gained or losses avoided through the violative trading, a penalty of up to three times the illicit windfall, and an order permanently barring an Advisory Person from the securities industry. Finally, an Advisory Person may be sued by investors seeking to recover damages for insider trading violations. 
 a) No Advisory Person may trade a security, either personally or on behalf of any other person or account (including any fund), while in possession of material, non-public information concerning that security or the issuer thereof, nor may any Advisory Person communicate material, non-public information to others in violation of the law. 

b) Information is material where there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making his or her investment decisions. Generally, this includes any information the disclosure of which will have a substantial effect on the price of a security. No simple test exists to determine when information is material; assessments of materiality involve a highly fact specific inquiry. For this reason, an Advisory Person should direct any questions about whether information is material to the Chief Compliance Officer. Material information often relates to a company s results and operations, including, for example, dividend changes, earnings results, changes in previously released earnings estimates, significant merger or acquisition proposals or agreements, major litigation, liquidation problems, and extraordinary management developments. Material information may also relate to the market for a company s securities. Information about a significant order to purchase or sell Securities may, in some contexts, be material. Pre publication information regarding reports in the financial press may also be material. 

c) Information is public when it has been disseminated broadly to investors in the marketplace. For example, information is public after it has become available to the general public through a public filing with the SEC or some other government agency, the Dow Jones tape or The Wall Street Journal or some other publication of general circulation, and after sufficient time has passed so that the information has been disseminated widely. 

d) An Advisory Person, before executing any trade for himself or herself, or others, including the Corporation or other accounts managed by the Adviser or by a stockholder of the Adviser, or any affiliate of the stockholder (collectively, Client Accounts ), must determine whether he or she has material, non-public information. Any Advisory Person who believes he or she is in possession of material, non-public information must take the following steps: 

(1) Report the information and proposed trade immediately to the Chief Compliance Officer. 

(2) Do not purchase or sell the securities on behalf of anyone, including Client Accounts. 

(3) Do not communicate the information to any person, other than to the Chief Compliance Officer. 

6 

After the Chief Compliance Officer has reviewed the issue, the Chief Compliance Officer will determine whether the information is material and non-public and, if so, what action the Advisory 
 Person should take. An Advisory Person must consult with the Chief Compliance Officer before taking any further action. This degree of caution will protect the Advisory Person and the Adviser. 
 e) To prevent and detect insider trading from occurring, the Chief Compliance Officer shall prepare and maintain a Restricted List in order to monitor and prevent the occurrence of insider trading in certain securities that Access Persons are prohibited or restricted from trading. The Chief Compliance Officer manages, maintains and updates the Restricted List to actually restrict trading (no buying, no selling, no shorting, no trading, etc.) in the securities of specific issuers for personal accounts and on behalf Adviser s clients. Before executing any trade for himself or herself, Advisory Persons are required to determine whether the transaction involves a security on the Restricted List. Advisory Persons are prohibited from trading any security which appears on the Restricted List, except that, with prior approval, an Advisory Person may sell securities which were not on the Restricted List when acquired (or which were acquired at a time when the Advisory Person was not subject to such restrictions). The Restricted List must be maintained strictly confidential and not disclosed to anyone outside of the Adviser and the Corporation. 

f) Contacts with public companies will sometimes be a part of an Adviser s research efforts. Persons providing investment advisory services to the Corporation may make investment decisions on the basis of conclusions formed through such contacts and analysis of publicly available information. Difficult legal issues arise, however, when, in the course of these contacts, an Advisory Person becomes aware of material, non-public information. This could happen, for example, if a company s chief financial officer prematurely discloses quarterly results to an analyst, or an investor relations representative makes selective disclosure of adverse news to a handful of investors. In such situations, the Adviser must make a judgment as to its further conduct. To protect yourself, clients and the Adviser, you should contact the Chief Compliance Officer immediately if you believe that you may have received material, non-public information. 

Section IX Annual Certification 
 a) Access Persons. 

Access Persons who are directors, managers, officers or employees of the Corporation or the Adviser shall be required to certify annually that they have read this Code and that they understand it and recognize that they are subject to it. Further, such Access Persons shall be required to certify annually that they have complied with the requirements of this Code. 
 b) Board Review. 

No less frequently than annually, the Corporation and the Adviser must furnish to the Corporation s board of directors, and the board must consider, a written report that: (1) describes any issues arising under this Code or procedures since the last report to the board, including, but not limited to, information about material violations of this Code or procedures and sanctions imposed in response to material violations; and (2) certifies that the Corporation or the Adviser, as applicable, has adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons from violating this Code. 
 
 Section X Sanctions

Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, suspension or termination of employment, a letter of censure and/or restitution of an amount equal to the difference between the price paid or received by the Corporation and the more advantageous price paid or received by the offending person.

PENNANTPARK INVESTMENT CORPORATION CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT 
 
 I. Covered Persons/Purpose of the Code 
 
 This code of business conduct (this Code for PennantPark Investment Corporation (the Corporation applies to the Corporation s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions (collectively, the Covered Officers ), as well as directors, officers, and employees (collectively with the Covered Officers, the Covered Persons for the purpose of promoting: 
 honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; 

full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC or the New York Stock Exchange NYSE and in other public communications made by the Corporation; 

compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations; 

the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and 

accountability for adherence to the Code. 

Each Covered Person should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest. 
 
 II. Covered Persons Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of Interest 
 
 A conflict of interest occurs when a Covered Person s private interest interferes with the interests of, or his/her service to, the Corporation. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Person, or a member of his/her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his/her position in the Corporation. 
 
 Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between Covered Persons and the Corporation and already are subject to conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Corporation because of their status as affiliated persons of the Corporation. The Corporation s compliance programs and procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. Each Covered Officer is an employee of a service provider 
 
 Service Provider to the Corporation. Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship between the Corporation and the Service Providers of which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the Corporation or for the Service Provider of which the Covered Officer is an employee, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions which will have different effects on the Service Provider and the Corporation. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the Corporation and the Service Provider and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Corporation. Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Board of Directors that the Covered Officers may also be or in the future become officers or employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other Codes. 
 
 9 

Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Persons should keep in mind that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal interest of a Covered Person should not be placed improperly before the interest of the Corporation. 
 
 Each 
 
 Covered Person must: 
 not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Corporation whereby the Covered Person would benefit personally to the detriment of the Corporation; 

not cause the Corporation to take action, or fail to take action, for the individual personal benefit of the Covered Person rather than for the benefit of the Corporation; and 

not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or contemplated for the Corporation to trade personally or cause others to trade personally in contemplation of the market effect of such transactions. 

There are some conflict of interest situations that may be discussed with the Corporation s Chief Compliance Officer if material. Examples of these include: 1 
 service as a director on the board of any public or private company; 

_________________ 
 
 1 Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered Person would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Person if a member of the Covered Person s family engages in such an activity or has such a relationship. 
 
 the receipt of any non-nominal gifts from any person or company with which the Corporation has current or prospective business dealings. For purposes of this Code, nonnominal are those gifts in excess of 100; 

the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which the Corporation has current or prospective business dealings, unless such entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety; 

any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship with, any of the Corporation s service providers, other than its investment adviser, sub-adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person thereof and the Service Provider of which such Covered Person is an employee; and 

a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction charges or spreads paid by the Corporation for effecting portfolio transactions or for selling or repurchasing shares other than an interest arising from the Covered Person s employment, such as compensation or equity ownership. 

III. Disclosure Compliance 
 
 Each Covered Person should be familiar with the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Corporation; 

each Covered Person should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Corporation to others, whether within or outside the Corporation, including to the Corporation s directors and auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations; 

each Covered Person should, to the extent appropriate within his area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the Corporation and the Corporation s adviser or sub-adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Corporation files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made by the Corporation; and 

it is the responsibility of each Covered Person to promote compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations. 

10 

IV. Reporting and Accountability Each Covered Person must: 
 upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a Covered Person), affirm in writing to the Board that he has received, read, and understands the Code; 

annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied with the requirements of the Code; 

not retaliate against any employee or Covered Person or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that are made in good faith; 

notify the Chief Compliance Officer of the Corporation promptly if he knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code; and 

report at least annually any change in his affiliations from the prior year. 

The Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Audit Committee (the Committee is responsible for granting waivers 2 and determining sanctions, as appropriate, and any approvals, interpretations or waivers sought by the Corporation s principal executive officers or directors will be considered by the Committee. 
 
 The Corporation will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this Code: 
 the Chief Compliance Officer will take any action he considers appropriate to investigate any actual or potential violations reported to him; 

if, after such investigation, the Chief Compliance Officer believes that no violation has occurred, the Chief Compliance Officer shall meet with the person reporting the violation for the purposes of informing such person of the reason for not taking action; 

any matter that the Chief Compliance Officer believes is a violation will be reported to the Committee; 

if the Committee concurs that a violation has occurred, it will inform and make a recommendation to the Board, which will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the Service Provider of which such Covered Person is an employee or its board; a recommendation to such Service Provider to dismiss the Covered Person; or dismissal of the Covered Person as an officer of the 

Corporation; 

______________________ 
 2 Instruction 2 to Item 5.05 of Form 8-K defines waiver as the approval by the registrant of a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics and implicit waiver, which must also be disclosed, as the registrant s failure to take action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive officer of the registrant. 
 
 the Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate; and 

any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules. 

Please note that waivers for executive officers or directors must be promptly disclosed in Form 8-K or on the Corporation s website within four business days. 
 
 The Committee, in determining whether waivers should be granted and whether violations have occurred, and the Chief Compliance Officer, in rendering decisions and interpretations and in conducting investigations of potential violations under the Code, may, at their discretion, consult with such other persons as they may determine to be appropriate, including, but not limited to, a senior legal officer of the Corporation or its adviser or its sub-adviser, counsel to the Corporation or the Service Provider, independent auditors or other consultants, subject to any requirement to seek pre-approval from the Corporation s Committee for the retention of independent auditors to perform permissible non-audit services. 
 11 

v. Waivers 

An executive officer or director may request a waiver of any of the provisions of this Code by submitting a written request for such waiver to the Committee setting forth the basis for such request and explaining how the waiver would be consistent with the standards of conduct described herein. The Committee shall review such request and make a determination thereon in writing, which shall be binding. 
 
 In determining whether to waive any provisions of this Code, the Committee shall consider whether the proposed waiver is consistent with honest and ethical conduct. 
 The Chief Compliance Officer shall submit an annual report to the Board regarding waivers granted. 
 i. Other Policies and Procedures 

This Code will be the sole code of business conduct adopted by the Corporation for purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and forms applicable to the Corporation thereunder, and Section 303A.10 of the Listed Company Manual of the NYSE. Insofar as other policies or procedures of the Corporation, the Corporation s adviser, sub-adviser, principal underwriter, or the Service Providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Persons who are subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. The codes of ethics of the Corporation and their investment adviser, sub-adviser, principal underwriter and Service Providers under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act are separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code. 
 i. Amendments 

Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Corporation s board, including a majority of independent directors. 
 i. Confidentiality 

All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Board and its counsel, the investment adviser and its counsel, the Service Provider of which such Covered Person is an employee or independent auditors or other consultants referred to in Section IV above.

EXHIBIT 97.1 
 
 PENNANTPARK INVESTMENT CORPORATION 
 
 PENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD. 
 
 CLAWBACK POLICY 
 
 The Board of Directors (the Board of each of PennantPark Investment Corporation, a Maryland corporation PNNT ), and PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd., a Maryland corporation PFLT , and collectively with PNNT, the Company ), believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to adopt this Clawback Policy (this Policy ), which provides for the recovery of Incentive-Based Compensation received by Covered Executives, if any, in the event of an Accounting Restatement (as such terms are defined below). The Company currently does not pay or otherwise award Incentive-Based Compensation to Covered Executives but nevertheless has designed and implemented this Policy to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act Rule 10D-1 and Section 303A.14 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual (the Listing Standards ). This Policy shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Rule 10D-1 and the Listing Standards. 
 
 1. Administration 
 
 Except as specifically set forth herein, this Policy shall be administered by the Board or, if so designated by the Board, a committee thereof (the Board or such committee charged with administration of this Policy, the Administrator ). The Administrator is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate or advisable for the administration of this Policy. Any determinations made by the Administrator shall be final and binding on all affected individuals and need not be uniform with respect to each individual covered by this Policy. In the administration of this Policy, the Administrator is authorized and directed to consult with the full Board (if this Policy is administered by a committee of the Board in accordance herewith) or such committees of the Board, such as the Audit Committee, Compliance Committee or the Compensation Committee, as applicable and as may be necessary or appropriate as to matters within the scope of such committee s responsibility and authority. Subject to any limitation of applicable law, the Administrator may authorize and empower any one or more officers of the Company to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Policy (other than with respect to any recovery under this Policy involving any such officer(s)). 
 
 2. Definitions 
 
 As used in this Policy, the following definitions shall apply: 
 a) Accounting Restatement means an accounting restatement of the Company s financial statements due to the Company s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws of the United States of America, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. 

b) Administrator has the meaning set forth in Section 1 hereof. 

c) Applicable Period means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, as well as any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years (except that a transition period between the last day of the Company s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to 12 months shall be deemed a completed fiscal year). The date on which the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement is the earlier to occur of (a) the date the Board, a committee thereof, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if action by the Board or a committee thereof is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement or (b) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement, in each case regardless of if or when the restated financial statements are filed. 

d) Covered Executives means any current or former executive officer of the Company, including the Company s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer of the Company who performs a policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company, and any officer within the meaning of 17 C.F.R. 229.401(b). An executive officer of the Company s parent or subsidiary is deemed a Covered Executive if the executive officer performs such policy making functions for the Company. Policy making function is not intended to include policy making functions that are not significant to the Company. The definition of Covered Executives shall be interpreted in accordance with the definition of Executive Officer set forth in Rule 10D-1 and the Listing Standards. 

e) Erroneously Awarded Compensation has the meaning set forth in Section 5 of this Policy. 

f) Financial Reporting Measure means any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measure that is derived wholly or in part from such measure. For the avoidance of doubt, Financial Reporting Measures include but are not limited to the following (and any measure derived from the following): the Company s stock price; total stockholder return TSR ; net asset value; net investment income; net investment gains; profitability; financial ratios; earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization; funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations; liquidity measures; return measures (e.g., return on investment capital; return on assets); earnings measures 

(e.g., earnings per share); and any of such financial reporting measures relative to a peer group. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the Company s financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

g) Incentive-Based Compensation means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. For purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed received in the Company s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive -Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of such Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. 

3. Covered Executives; Incentive-Based Compensation 
 
 This Policy applies to all Incentive-Based Compensation received by a person (a) after beginning services as a Covered Executive; (b) if that person served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation; and (c) while the Company had a class of its securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association. 
 
 4. Required Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in the Event of an Accounting Restatement 
 
 In the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall recover reasonably promptly the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by any Covered Executive, as calculated pursuant to Section 5 hereof, during the Applicable Period. 
 
 5. Erroneously Awarded Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery 
 
 The amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation subject to recovery under this Policy, as determined by the Administrator, is the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received by the Covered Executive that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received by the Covered Executive had it been determined based on the restated amounts. 
 
 Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be computed without regard to any taxes paid by the Covered Executive with respect to the Erroneously Awarded Compensation. 
 
 For Incentive-Based Compensation based on the Company s stock price or TSR: (a) the Administrator shall determine the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or TSR upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received; and (b) the Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE ). 
 
 6. Method of Recovery 
 
 The Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion, the timing and method for promptly recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation hereunder, which may include without limitation (a) seeking reimbursement of all or part of any cash or equity-based award, (b) cancelling prior cash or equity-based awards, whether vested or unvested or paid or unpaid, (c) cancelling or offsetting against any planned future cash or equity-based awards, (d) forfeiture of deferred compensation, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and (e) any other method authorized by applicable law or contract. Subject to compliance with applicable law, the Administrator may affect recovery under this Policy from any amount otherwise payable to the Covered Executive, including amounts payable to such individual under any otherwise applicable Company plan or program, including base salary, bonuses, other compensation, and/or compensation previously deferred by the Covered Executive. 
 
 The Company is authorized and directed pursuant to this Policy to promptly recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation in compliance with this Policy unless the Board (including a majority of independent directors) or applicable committee thereof has determined that recovery would be impracticable solely for one of the following limited reasons, and subject to the following procedural requirements: 
 
 a) The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company must make, or cause to be made, a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover and provide that documentation to the NYSE; 

b) Recovery would violate home country law of the Company where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recovery any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company must obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the NYSE, that recovery would result in such a violation and provide such opinion to the NYSE; or 

c) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified requirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to executive officers and/or employees, if any, of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. 

7. No indemnification of Covered Executives 
 
 Notwithstanding the terms of any indemnification or insurance policy or any contractual or other arrangements with any Covered Executive that may be interpreted to the contrary, the Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, including any payment or reimbursement for the cost of third-party insurance purchased by any Covered Executives to fund potential clawback obligations under this Policy. 

8. Administrator Indemnification 
 
 Any members of the Administrator, and any other members of the Board who assist in the administration of this Policy, shall not be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made with respect to this Policy and shall be fully indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent under applicable law and Company policy with respect to any such action, determination or interpretation. The foregoing sentence shall not limit any other rights to indemnification of the members of the Board under applicable law or Company policy. 
 
 9. Effective Date; Retroactive Application 
 
 This Policy shall be effective as of December 1, 2023 (the Effective Date ). The terms of this Policy shall apply to any Incentive-Based Compensation that is received by Covered Executives on or after the Effective Date, even if such Incentive-Based Compensation was approved, awarded, granted or paid to Covered Executives prior to the Effective Date. Without limiting the generality of Section 6 hereof, and subject to applicable aw, the Administrator may affect recovery under this Policy from any amount of compensation approved, awarded, granted, payable or paid to the Covered Executive prior to, on or after the Effective Date. 
 
 10. Amendment; Termination 
 
 The Board may amend, modify, supplement, rescind or replace all or any portion of this Policy at any time and from time to time in its discretion, and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to comply with applicable law or any rules or standards adopted by a national securities exchange on which the Company s securities are listed. 
 
 11. Other Recovery Rights; Company Claims 
 
 The Board intends that this Policy shall be applied to the fullest extent of applicable law. Any right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Company under applicable law or pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company. 
 
 Nothing contained in this Policy, and no recovery as contemplated by this Policy, shall limit any claims, damages or other legal remedies the Company or any of its affiliates may have against a Covered Executive arising out of resulting from any actions or omissions by the Covered Executive. 
 
 12. Successors 
 
 This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives. 
 
 13. Exhibit Filing Requirement 
 
 A copy of this Policy, including any amendments thereto, shall be filed as an exhibit to the Company s annual report on Form 10-K to the extent required by applicable law.

Independent Auditor s Report 

Member Designees Committee 
 PennantPark Senior Loan Fund, LLC 

Opinion 
 We have audited the consolidated financial statements of PennantPark Senior Loan Fund, LLC and its subsidiaries (the Fund), which comprise the consolidated statements of assets, liabilities and members equity, including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in members equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). 
 
 In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations, changes in members equity and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Fund and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
 
 Emphasis of Matter 
 As discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the 2022 financial statements have been restated to reclassify certain amounts presented within. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 
 
 Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 
 Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
 In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. 
 
 Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 
 
 In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: 
 Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 

1. ORGANIZATION 
 
 PennantPark Senior Loan Fund, LLC, or PSLF, is organized as a Delaware limited liability company and commenced operations in July 2020. PSLF is a joint venture between PennantPark Investment Corporation PNNT and Pantheon Ventures (UK), LLP Pantheon ). In this report, except where the context suggests otherwise, the terms Company, we, our, or us refer to PSLF and its consolidated subsidiary. 
 
 The Company's investment objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation while seeking to preserve capital through debt and equity investments primarily made to U.S. middle-market companies in the form of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt and subordinated debt and equity investments. 
 
 PNNT and Pantheon (individually a Member and collectively the Members ), provide capital to PSLF in the form of notes and equity interests. On July 31, 2020, PNNT contributed its formerly wholly-owned subsidiary, PennantPark Investment Funding I, LLC Funding I to the Company in exchange for a 72 stake in PSLF. As of July 31, 2020, Funding I held 356.1 million of senior loans at fair value and had 240.0 million of debt outstanding (see Note 10). On July 31, 2020 Pantheon invested 35.0 million to acquire a 28 stake in PSLF of which 22.5 million was used to partially pay down Funding I's outstanding debt. Subsequent to the contribution of Funding I by PNNT, Funding I became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PSLF and its operations are consolidated with and into the operations of PSLF. 
 
 On October 31, 2020, PNNT and Pantheon contributed an additional 1.8 million and 27.5 million, respectively, to PSLF. PNNT s and Pantheon s additional investments came in at PSLF s then current Members equity. As a result of the additional capital contribution, PNNT and Pantheon owned 60.5 and 39.5 , respectively, of the outstanding notes and equity interests of PSLF (see Note 6). 
 
 The administrative agent of the Company is PennantPark Investment Administration, LLC (the Administrative Agent ). The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (the Sub-Administrator provides certain services to the Company with respect to certain accounting matters and has the responsibility for the official books and records. 
 
 PNNT and Pantheon each appointed two members to PSLF s four-person member designees committee. All material decisions with respect to PSLF, including those involving its investment portfolio, require unanimous approval of a quorum of the member designees. Quorum is defined as (i) the presence of two members of the member designees committee; provided that at least one individual is present that was elected, designated or appointed by each member; (ii) the presence of three members of the member designees committee, provided that the individual that was elected, designated or appointed by the member with only one individual present shall be entitled to cast two votes on each matter; and (iii) the presence of four members of the member designees or investment committee shall constitute a quorum, provided that two individuals are present that were elected, designated or appointed by each member.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 (Continued) 

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 PSLF is considered an investment company under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and follows the accounting and reporting guidance applicable to investment companies in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946. References to the Accounting Standards Codification, as amended ASC ), serves as a source of accounting literature. Subsequent events are evaluated and disclosed as appropriate for events occurring through the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. In the opinion of the Company, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements have been included. Actual results could differ from these estimates due to changes in the economic and regulatory environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates and assumptions. We have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions. 
 
 (a) Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statement 
 
 During the preparation of the financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023, Management identified an error in the classification and presentation of cash pertaining to the Company s affiliate, PNNT, in the September 30, 2022 financial statements. The Company recorded cash activity and due from affiliate pertaining to their investments as an increase in the cash account instead of presenting the related cash and cash equivalents as an asset and another asset for due from affiliate. The impact of the error correction is reflected in a 2.0 million decrease to cash and offsetting increase to due from affiliates as of September 30, 2022 and a decrease in due from affiliates within operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows totaling 2.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. There was no impact from the error correction to total members' equity as reported on the consolidated statement of assets, liabilities and members' equity as of September 30, 2022. In addition, there was no impact from the error correction on net investment income or net increase (decrease) in members' equity resulting from operations in total as reported on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2022. The corrections were reported in the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Our significant accounting policies consistently applied are as follows: 
 
 (b) Investment Valuations 
 
 We expect that there may not be readily available market values for many of our investments, which are or will be in our portfolio, and we value such investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our member designees using a documented valuation policy, described herein, and a consistently applied valuation process. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that the member designees may consider in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate or revise our valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and the difference may be material. See Note 4. 
 
 Our portfolio generally consists of illiquid securities, including debt investments. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value, our member designees undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 	 
 (1) Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC, the investment adviser to PNNT, responsible for the portfolio investment; 

(2) Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the management of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC; 

(3) Our member designees also engages independent valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment. The independent valuation firms review PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC s preliminary valuations in light of their own independent assessment and also in light of any market quotations obtained from an independent pricing service, broker, dealer or market maker; 

(4) Our member designees reviews the preliminary valuations of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC and those of the independent valuation firms on a quarterly basis, periodically assesses the valuation methodologies of the independent valuation firms, and responds to and supplements the valuation recommendations of the independent valuation firms to reflect any comments; and 

(5) Our member designees assesses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC and the respective independent valuation firms. 

11 
 
 PENNANTPARK SENIOR LOAN FUND, LLC 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 (Continued) 

Our member designees generally uses market quotations to assess the value of our investments for which market quotations are readily available. We obtain these market values from independent pricing services or at bid prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers, if available, or otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC assesses the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If the member designees has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available. 
 
 (c) Security Transactions, Revenue Recognition, and Realized/Unrealized Gains or Losses 
 
 Security transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt investments with contractual payment-in-kind, or PIK interest, which represents interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will generally not accrue PIK interest when the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectable. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt investments if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount OID ), market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on liabilities, which we do not fair value, are capitalized and then accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as interest expense. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned. 
 
 Loans are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more and/or if there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest receivable is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the Company's judgment. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in the Company's judgment, are likely to remain current. There were no loans on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 We measure realized gains and losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in the fair values of our portfolio investments during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation and depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. 
 
 (d) Income Taxes 
 
 PSLF is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Accordingly, no provisions for U.S. income taxes have been made. The Members are responsible for reporting their share of the PSLF s income or loss on their U.S. income tax returns. 
 
 In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, the Company is required to determine whether a tax position of PSLF is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, to be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized could result in PSLF recording a tax liability that would reduce members capital. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, there were no material uncertain income tax positions. 
 
 (e) Foreign Currency Translation 
 
 Our books and records are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis: 
 
 1. Fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the applicable period; and 

2. Purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at the exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. 

Although net assets and fair values are presented based on the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, we do not isolate that portion of the results of operations due to changes in foreign exchange rates on investments, other assets and debt from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair values of investments held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments and liabilities. 
 
 Foreign security and currency translations may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies and U.S. government securities. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices to be more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities.

 SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 (Continued) 

(f) Consolidation 
 
 As explained by ASC paragraph 946-810-45, PSLF will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to us. 
 
 (g) Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes in the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement , which changes the fair value measurement disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820. The ASU removed the requirements to disclosure the policy for the timing of transfers between levels, the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements, the Level 3 reconciliation from opening balances to closing balances, and the change in unrealized gains and losses of Level 3 fair value measurements held on the balance sheet date. While most changes are applied on a retrospective basis, the ASU still requires the change in unrealized gain and losses of Level 3 fair value measurements held as of the prior year to be disclosed. As a result of these removals certain modifications were made, including disclosure of the amount of and reason for transfers into and out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the amount of purchases and issues of Level 3 assets and liabilities. The Company adopted this ASU for the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 In March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting ASU 2020-04 ). The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company utilized the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the years ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the effect of which was not material to the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. 
 
 In March 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) ASU 2022-02 ), which is intended to address issues identified during the post-implementation review of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The amendment, among other things, eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors , while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted ASU 2022-02 on its consolidated financial statement and disclosures. 
 
 In June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions , which changed the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. The amendments clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements, but the impact of the adoption is not expected to be material. 
 
 3. AGREEMENTS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, PSLF purchased 127.8 million and 395.3 million of investments from PNNT, respectively. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, PSLF incurred 2.0 million and 1.2 million of administration fees to the Administrative Agent, respectively. The Administrative Agent provides administration services to PSLF at an annual rate of 0.25 based on average gross assets under management payable quarterly in arrears and calculated based on average gross assets (measured at cost) at the end of the two recently completed calendar quarters. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, PSLF incurred 20.9 million and 11.7 million of interest expense related to the notes outstanding with the Members, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, PSLF had a receivable from PNNT of 3.3 million and 2.0 million, respectively, presented as due from affiliate on the consolidated statement of assets, liabilities and members' equity. These amounts are related to cash owed from PNNT in connection with trades between the funds.

4. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
 Fair value, as defined under ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, is the price that we would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment or liability. ASC Topic 820 emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available to us on the reporting period date. 
 
 ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchies: 
 
 Level 1:	Inputs that are quoted prices (un-adjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date. 
 
 Level 2:	Inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term, if applicable, of the financial instrument. 
 
 Level 3:	Inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability because they are based on our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability. 
 
 A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Generally, most of our investments are classified as Level 3. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and those differences may be material. 
 
 The inputs into the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. Even if observable market data is available, such information may be the result of consensus pricing information, disorderly transactions or broker quotes which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing and/or quotes accompanied by disclaimer would result in classification as Level 3 information, assuming no additional corroborating evidence were available. Corroborating evidence that would result in classifying these non-binding broker/dealer bids as a Level 2 asset includes observable market-based transactions for the same or similar assets or other relevant observable market-based inputs that may be used in pricing an asset. 
 
 Our investments are generally structured as debt in the form of first lien secured debt, but may also include second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments. The transaction price, excluding transaction costs, is typically the best estimate of fair value at inception. Ongoing reviews by the Members and independent valuation firms are based on an assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sale transactions with third parties, expected cash flows and market-based information including comparable transactions, performance multiples and yields, among other factors. These non-public investments using unobservable inputs are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 A review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in our ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities. 
 
 In addition to using the above inputs in valuing cash equivalents and investments, we employ the valuation policy approved by our member designees that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading, in determining fair value. See Note 2. 
 
 As outlined in the table below, some of our Level 3 investments using a market comparable valuation technique are valued using the average of the bids from brokers or dealers. The bids include a disclaimer, may not have corroborating evidence, may be the result of a disorderly transaction and may be the result of consensus pricing. The Members assess the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If the member designee has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available. 
 
 Some of our investments can also be valued using a market comparable or an enterprise market value technique. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that the member designees may consider in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the pricing indicated by the external event, excluding transaction costs, is used to corroborate the valuation. When using earnings multiples to value a portfolio company, the multiple used requires the use of judgment and estimates in determining how a market participant would price such an asset. These non-public investments using unobservable inputs are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Generally, the sensitivity of unobservable inputs or combination of inputs such as industry comparable companies, market outlook, consistency, discount rates and reliability of earnings and prospects for growth, or lack thereof, affects the multiple used in pricing an investment. As a result, any change in any one of those factors may have a significant impact on the valuation of an investment. Generally, an increase in a market yield will result in a decrease in the valuation of a debt investment, while a decrease in a market yield will have the opposite effect. Generally,

 5. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
 
 Cash equivalents represent cash invested in overnight money market funds. These temporary investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are deemed cash equivalents. Cash deposited at financial institutions is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ), up to specified limits. At times, such balances may exceed FDIC insured amounts. As of September 30, 2023, the entire amount of 59.1 million included in the cash and cash equivalents balance on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities is comprised of money market funds, which are not subject to FDIC insurance. As of September 30, 2022, cash and cash equivalents consisted of money market funds in the amounts of 40.9 million at fair value. PSLF believes it is not exposed to any significant risk of loss on its cash and cash equivalents.

8. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
 
 Investments 
 
 PSLF seeks investment opportunities that offer the possibility of attaining income generation, capital preservation and capital appreciation including investments in private companies. Certain events particular to each industry in which PSLF s investments conduct their operations, as well as general economic and political conditions, may have a significant negative impact on the investee s operations and profitability. Such events are beyond PSLF s controls, and the likelihood that they may occur cannot be predicted. Furthermore, investments of PSLF are made in private companies and there are generally no public markets for these securities at the current time. The ability of PSLF to liquidate these investments and realize value is subject to significant limitations and uncertainties. 
 
 Leverage Risk 
 
 PSLF may borrow funds in order to increase the amount of capital available for investment. The use of leverage can improve the return on invested capital, however, such use may also magnify the potential for loss on invested capital. If the value of PSLF s assets decreases, leveraging would cause members equity to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had PSLF not used leverage. Similarly, any decrease in PSLF s income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had PSLF not borrowed. Borrowings will usually be from credit facilities or debt securitizations which will typically be secured by PSLF s securities and other assets. Under certain circumstances, such debt may demand an increase in the collateral that secures PSLF s obligations and if PSLF was unable to provide additional collateral, the debt could liquidate assets held in the account to satisfy PSLF s obligations. Liquidation in this manner could have adverse consequences. Additionally, the amount of PSLF s borrowings and the interest rates on those borrowings, which will fluctuate, could have a significant effect on PSLF s profitability. 

Credit Risk 
 
 PSLF primarily invests in first lien secured debt to middle-market companies. A majority of the investments held by PSLF are subject to restrictions on their resale or are otherwise illiquid. PSLF assumes the credit risk of the borrower. In the event that the borrower becomes insolvent or enters bankruptcy, PSLF may incur certain costs and delays in realizing payment, or may suffer a loss of principal and/or interest.

Independent Auditor s Report 

To the Member Designees Committee 
 PennantPark Senior Loan Fund, LLC 

Opinion 
 We have audited the consolidated financial statements of PennantPark Senior Loan Fund, LLC and its subsidiaries (the Fund), which comprise the consolidated statements of assets, liabilities, and members equity, including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in members equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). 
 
 In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations, changes in members equity and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Fund and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
 
 Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 
 Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
 In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. 
 
 Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 
 
 In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: 
 Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audit.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Continued) 
 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 PSLF is considered an investment company under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and follows the accounting and reporting guidance applicable to investment companies in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946. References to the Accounting Standards Codification, as amended ASC ), serves as a source of accounting literature. Subsequent events are evaluated and disclosed as appropriate for events occurring through the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Members to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. In the opinion of the Members, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements have been included. Actual results could differ from these estimates due to changes in the economic and regulatory environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates and assumptions. We have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions. 
 
 Our significant accounting policies consistently applied are as follows: 
 
 (a) Investment Valuations 
 
 We expect that there may not be readily available market values for many of our investments, which are or will be in our portfolio, and we value such investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our member designees using a documented valuation policy, described herein, and a consistently applied valuation process. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that the member designees may consider in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate or revise our valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and the difference may be material. See Note 4. 
 
 Our portfolio generally consists of illiquid securities, including debt investments. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value, our member designees undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 	 
 (1) Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC, the investment adviser to PNNT, responsible for the portfolio investment; 

(2) Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the management of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC; 

(3) Our member designees also engages independent valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment. The independent valuation firms review PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC s preliminary valuations in light of their own independent assessment and also in light of any market quotations obtained from an independent pricing service, broker, dealer or market maker; 

(4) Our member designees reviews the preliminary valuations of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC and those of the independent valuation firms on a quarterly basis, periodically assesses the valuation methodologies of the independent valuation firms, and responds to and supplements the valuation recommendations of the independent valuation firms to reflect any comments; and 

(5) Our member designees assesses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC and the respective independent valuation firms. 

Our member designees generally uses market quotations to assess the value of our investments for which market quotations are readily available. We obtain these market values from independent pricing services or at bid prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers, if available, or otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC assesses the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If the member designees has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available. 
 
 (b) Security Transactions, Revenue Recognition, and Realized/Unrealized Gains or Losses 
 
 Security transactions are recorded on a trade-date basis. We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt investments with contractual payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest, which represents interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will generally not accrue PIK interest when the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectable. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt investments if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount OID ), market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on liabilities, which we do not fair value, are capitalized and then accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as interest expense. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Continued) 
 Loans are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more and/or if there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest receivable is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the Members judgment. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in the Members judgment, are likely to remain current. There were no loans on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 We measure realized gains and losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in the fair values of our portfolio investments during the reporting period period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation and depreciation , when gains or losses are realized. 
 
 (c) Income Taxes 
 
 PSLF is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Accordingly, no provisions for U.S. income taxes have been made. The Members are responsible for reporting their share of the PSLF s income or loss on their U.S. income tax returns. 
 
 In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, the member designees are required to determine whether a tax position of PSLF is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, to be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized could result in PSLF recording a tax liability that would reduce members capital. 

For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no material uncertain income tax positions. 
 
 (d) Foreign Currency Translation 
 
 Our books and records are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis: 
 
 1. Fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the applicable period; and 

2. Purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at the exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. 

Although net assets and fair values are presented based on the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, we do not isolate that portion of the results of operations due to changes in foreign exchange rates on investments, other assets and debt from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair values of investments held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments and liabilities. 
 
 Foreign security and currency translations may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies and U.S. government securities. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices to be more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities. 
 
 (e) Consolidation 
 
 As explained by ASC paragraph 946-810-45, PSLF will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to us. 
 
 (f) Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 In March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company utilized the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the year ended September30, 2022, the effect of which was not material to the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. 
 
 In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which is intended to address issues identified during the post-implementation review of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The amendment, among other things, eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors , while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2022-02 on its consolidated financial statement and disclosures.

 SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Continued) 
 In June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-03, or ASU, 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, or ASU 2022-03, which changed the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. The amendments clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements, but the impact of the adoption is not expected to be material. 
 
 3. AGREEMENTS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, PSLF purchased 431.2 million and 149.4 million, respectively, in investments from PNNT and other affiliated entities. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, PSLF incurred 1.2 million and 1.2 million in administrative services paid to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent provides administration services to PSLF at an annual rate of 0.25 based on average gross assets. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, PSLF incurred 11.7 million and 9.5 million in interest expense related to the notes outstanding with the Members. 
 
 4. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
 Fair value, as defined under ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, is the price that we would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment or liability. ASC Topic 820 emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available to us on the reporting period date. 
 
 ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchies: 
 
 Level 1:	Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date. 
 
 Level 2:	Inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term, if applicable, of the financial instrument. 
 
 Level 3:	Inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability because they are based on our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability. 
 
 A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Generally, most of our investments are classified as Level 3. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and those differences may be material. 
 
 The inputs into the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. Even if observable market data is available, such information may be the result of consensus pricing information, disorderly transactions or broker quotes which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing and/or quotes accompanied by disclaimer would result in classification as Level 3 information, assuming no additional corroborating evidence were available. Corroborating evidence that would result in classifying these non-binding broker/dealer bids as a Level 2 asset includes observable market-based transactions for the same or similar assets or other relevant observable market-based inputs that may be used in pricing an asset. 
 
 Our investments are generally structured as debt in the form of first lien secured debt, but may also include second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments. The transaction price, excluding transaction costs, is typically the best estimate of fair value at inception. Ongoing reviews by the Members and independent valuation firms are based on an assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sale transactions with third parties, expected cash flows and market-based information including comparable transactions, performance multiples and yields, among other factors. These non-public investments using unobservable inputs are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 A review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in our ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities. 
 
 In addition to using the above inputs in valuing cash equivalents and investments, we employ the valuation policy approved by our member designees that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading, in determining fair value. See Note 2.

 PENNANTPARK SENIOR LOAN FUND, LLC 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Continued) 
 As outlined in the table below, some of our Level 3 investments using a market comparable valuation technique are valued using the average of the bids from brokers or dealers. The bids include a disclaimer, may not have corroborating evidence, may be the result of a disorderly transaction and may be the result of consensus pricing. The Members assess the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If the member designee has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available. 
 
 Some of our investments can also be valued using a market comparable or an enterprise market value technique. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that the member designees may consider in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the pricing indicated by the external event, excluding transaction costs, is used to corroborate the valuation. When using earnings multiples to value a portfolio company, the multiple used requires the use of judgment and estimates in determining how a market participant would price such an asset. These non-public investments using unobservable inputs are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Generally, the sensitivity of unobservable inputs or combination of inputs such as industry comparable companies, market outlook, consistency, discount rates and reliability of earnings and prospects for growth, or lack thereof, affects the multiple used in pricing an investment. As a result, any change in any one of those factors may have a significant impact on the valuation of an investment. Generally, an increase in a market yield will result in a decrease in the valuation of a debt investment, while a decrease in a market yield will have the opposite effect. Generally, an increase in an EBITDA multiple will result in an increase in the valuation of an investment, while a decrease in an EBITDA will have the opposite effect.

5. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
 
 Cash equivalents represent cash in money market funds pending investment in longer-term portfolio holdings. Our portfolio may consist of temporary investments in U.S. Treasury Bills (of varying maturities), repurchase agreements, money market funds or repurchase agreement-like treasury securities. These temporary investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are deemed cash equivalents and are included in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. U.S. Treasury Bills with maturities greater than 60 days from the time of purchase are valued consistent with our valuation policy. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, cash and cash equivalents consisted of money market funds in the amounts of 42.9 million and 11.0 million at fair value. 
 
 6. MEMBERS EQUITY 
 
 PNNT and Pantheon provide capital to PSLF in the form of equity interests. As described in Note 1, PNNT and Pantheon's initial equity interests ownership percentages were 72.0 and 28 , respectively. On October 31, 2020, PNNT and Pantheon contributed an additional 10.8 million , non pro-rata, to PSLF. PNNT and Pantheon s additional equity investments came in at PSLF s then current Members equity. As a result, PNNT and Pantheon owned 60.5 and 39.5 , respectively, of the equity interests of PSLF. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021 the equity interest ownership percentages remained 60.5 and 39.5 respectively. 

7. NOTES PAYABLE TO MEMBERS 
 
 PNNT and Pantheon provide capital to PSLF in the form of subordinated notes. As described above in Note 1, PNNT and Pantheon initially owned 72.0 and 28.0 respectively, of the subordinated notes. On October 31, 2020, PNNT and Pantheon contributed an additional 18.5 million, non pro-rata, to PSLF in the form of additional subordinated notes. As a result, PNNT and Pantheon owned 60.5 and 39.5 , respectively, of the subordinated notes of PSLF. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the subordinated notes ownership percentages remained 60.5 and 39.5 respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the subordinated notes outstanding were 145.5 million and 106.0 million and is shown as Notes payable to members on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities and Members Equity.

 PENNANTPARK SENIOR LOAN FUND, LLC 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Continued) 
 8. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
 
 Investments 
 
 PSLF seeks investment opportunities that offer the possibility of attaining income generation, capital preservation and capital appreciation including investments in private companies. Certain events particular to each industry in which PSLF s investments conduct their operations, as well as general economic and political conditions, may have a significant negative impact on the investee s operations and profitability. Such events are beyond PSLF s controls, and the likelihood that they may occur cannot be predicted. Furthermore, investments of PSLF are made in private companies and there are generally no public markets for these securities at the current time. The ability of PSLF to liquidate these investments and realize value is subject to significant limitations and uncertainties. 
 
 Leverage Risk 
 
 PSLF may borrow funds in order to increase the amount of capital available for investment. The use of leverage can improve the return on invested capital, however, such use may also magnify the potential for loss on invested capital. If the value of PSLF s assets decreases, leveraging would cause members equity to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had PSLF not used leverage. Similarly, any decrease in PSLF s income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had PSLF not borrowed. Borrowings will usually be from credit facilities and will typically be secured by PSLF s securities and other assets. Under certain circumstances, such credit facilities may demand an increase in the collateral that secures PSLF s obligations and if PSLF was unable to provide additional collateral, the credit facilities could liquidate assets held in the account to satisfy PSLF s obligations. Liquidation in this manner could have adverse consequences. Additionally, the amount of PSLF s borrowings and the interest rates on those borrowings, which will fluctuate, could have a significant effect on PSLF s profitability. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 PSLF primarily invests in first lien secured debt to middle-market companies. A majority of the investments held by PSLF are subject to restrictions on their resale or are otherwise illiquid. PSLF assumes the credit risk of the borrower. In the event that the borrower becomes insolvent or enters bankruptcy, PSLF may incur certain costs and delays in realizing payment, or may suffer a loss of principal and/or interest. 
 
 9. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
 
 The Members are responsible for all investment making and business decisions, therefore, there is no requirement to show financial highlights per ASC Topic 946, which have been omitted accordingly. 
 
 10. LEVERAGE 
 
 Credit Facility 
 
 As described in Note 1 above, PNNT contributed Funding I to the Company. As of the contribution date Funding I had a 250 million senior secured revolving credit facility with BNP Paribas (the BNP Credit Facility ). The BNP Credit Facility is a five-year revolving facility with a stated maturity of February 22, 2024 and bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.60 . The BNP Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets of Funding I. 
 
 In November 2020, Funding I amended the BNP Credit Facility and increased the size to 275 million. 
 
 In March 2022, Funding I amended the BNP Credit Facility (the Amended BNP Credit Facility and reduced the total commitment to 225 million, extended the revolving period to March 2025 and extended maturity to March 2027. The Amended BNP Credit Facility bears interest at SOFR plus 2.55 . 
 
 In September 2022, Funding I amended the Amended BNP Credit Facility and increased the total commitment to 325 million and amended the interest rate to SOFR plus 2.60 . 

Asset - Backed Debt 
 In March 2, 2022, CLO IV completed a 300 million debt securitization in the form of a collateralized loan obligation (the Debt Securitization or the 2034 Asset-Backed Debt ). The 2034 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of middle market loans and participation interests in middle market loans. The Debt Securitization was executed through (A) a private placement of: (i) 30.0 million Class A-1a Loans maturing 2034, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 1.7 , (ii) 50.0 million Class A-1b Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes due 2034, which bear interest at 3.45 , (iii) 12.0 million Class A-2 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2034, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 1.9 , (iv) 21.0 million Class B Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2034, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 2.1 , (v) 24.0 million Class C Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2034, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 2.9 , (vi) 18.0 million Class D Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2034, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 4.0 , and (vii) 91.0 million Class A-1a Senior Secured Floating Rate notes due 2034 which bears interest at the three-month SOFR plus 1.7 , under a credit agreement by and among CLO IV, as issuer, various financial institutions, as lenders, and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as collateral trustee and as loan agent. As of September 30, 2022 the balance of the 2034 Asset-Backed Debt was 246.0 million.

 PENNANTPARK SENIOR LOAN FUND, LLC 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Continued) 
 On the closing date of the Debt Securitization, in consideration of our transfer to CLO IV of the initial closing date loan portfolio, Funding I received 100 of the Subordinated Notes of CLO IV, and a portion of the net cash proceeds received from the sale of the 2034 Asset-Backed Debt. The Subordinated Notes do not bear interest and had a stated value of approximately 58.0 million at the closing of the Debt Securitization. 
 
 The 2034 Asset-Backed Debt is included in the Consolidated Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Equity as debt of the Company and the Subordinated Notes were eliminated in consolidation. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had 246.0 million 2034 Asset-Backed Debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 5.0 . As of September 30, 2022, the unamortized fees on the 2034 Asset-Backed Debt were 2.1 million. 
 
 11. COMMITMENT AND CONTINGENCIES 
 
 As of September 30, 2022, The Company has 0.1 million of unfunded commitments to fund investments. 
 
 The Company has provided general indemnifications to the Members, any affiliate of the Members, and any person acting on behalf of he Members or that affiliate when they act , in good faith, in the best interest of the Company. The Company is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim but expects the risk of having to make any payments under these general business indemnifications to be remote. 
 
 12. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
 
 Subsequent events are evaluated and disclosed as appropriate for events occurring through the date of the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued on November 17, 2022. 
 
 On October 20, 2022 PSLF issued and the Members funded a capital call in the amount of 20.0 million
