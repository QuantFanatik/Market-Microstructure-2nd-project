The terms JMTM, we, us, our, and the Company refer to James Maritime Holdings Inc. 3 Table of Contents PART I Item 1. Business. Overview James Maritime Holdings Inc., a Nevada corporation James Maritime conducts substantially all of the Company s business through its subsidiaries, its majority-owned subsidiary, Gladiator Solutions Inc. Gladiator ), and its wholly owned subsidiary United Security Specialists Inc. USS (James Maritime, Gladiator and USS shall be referred to collectively as the Company ). Gladiator produces revenues through the distribution of personal protective products, primarily through mail-in orders to customers or via e-commerce sales generated through their website. USS provides professional security personnel enhanced by smartphone-based security applications. Both Gladiator and USS are based in California. Our Company James Maritime has a long history operating in the U.S. public markets. The Company was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 18, 1992 as Out Takes, Inc. Through Los Alamos Energy, LLC, the Company operated a waste gas electricity plant in Los Alamos, California, which was acquired from American Cogenics in 1996. Due to uncertainties arising from PG E s bankruptcy, Los Alamos Energy elected to terminate its contract with PG E, and instead entered into a Participating Generator Agreement with the California Independent System Operator ISO). Despite its best efforts to adjust to the turbulent California energy markets, the Company was unable to sustain its operations and shut its power plant down in November 2001 because it did not have capital available for the plant maintenance that was required for continued operations. In 2002, because the power plant was inoperable, management began searching for potential merger and combination opportunities, with no success. After the power industry somewhat stabilized in California, the Company entered into a new power purchase agreement with PG E and attempted to recommence operations. In order to recommence power operations, the Company had to service and refurbish the Los Alamos Energy power generation equipment, and to pay current its obligations with Nickson s Machines amongst other creditors. In order to meet these obligations, the Company attempted to enter into an informal reorganization plan to creditors which, was ultimately unsuccessful, and it became clear that the Company would not be able to move forward in the recommencement of its operations. In June of 2007 the Company filed a Notice of termination of their SEC registration on Form 15 in order to restructure its operations. Between 2007 and 2014 the Company undertook the process of divesting itself of assets in order to pay down creditors, unwinding contracts and reorganizing its business. This process culminated on September 14, 2014, when Lance Hall, the sole officer and director of the Company, and majority interest owner and managing member of Los Alamos Energy, LLC, a California Limited Liability Company Releasor ), entered into a Debt Settlement Agreement with the Company to settle all outstanding debts and obligations of the Company owed to the Releasor or its assigns. The agreement also memorialized a termination and recission agreement which was signed, implemented and all terms of the rescission were completed on March 31, 2013, which effectively terminated and cancelled all ties and obligations to Los Alamos Energy, LLC previously agreed to in the purchase and sale agreement dated August 31, 1998. As part of the agreement Mr. Hall received 25,000 and 300,000 post-split common restricted shares of the Company (issued March 31, 2015), valued at 36,000 giving him control of the Company. On September 18, 2014 Mr. Hall appointed Mr. Masayuki Tsuda, Ms. Kazuyo Horigane as directors, Kip Eardley was appointed to serve as Director, President and CEO of the Company and Mr. Hall s resignation was accepted. In September of 2014, the three members of the Board of Directors funded the ongoing cleanup expenses and facilitated a search for synergistic or complementary corporate teaming partners that might be a candidate for a cooperative business combination. After the initial advance, it soon became clear to the Directors that the Company s expenses were too high and likely unsustainable unless they were immediately reduced. Shortly thereafter, the board of directors voted to redomicile the Company from Delaware to Nevada in order to reduce annual expenses. In conjunction with the redomicile, the Company also effectuated a reverse split of its capital stock and on January 23, 2015, a company named James Maritime Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada. On February 23, 2015, Out-Takes, Inc. merged with James Maritime Holdings, Inc., with Out-Takes being the surviving company resulting in a redomicile and change of the Company name to James Maritime Holdings, Inc. After changing its name and re-domiciling to Nevada, the Company began to pursue a growth strategy through merger and acquisition. After vetting numerous merger candidates, the Company eventually entered into a share exchange agreement with Sweet Hemp Alabama in 2019. Sweet Hemp Alabama was engaged in the sale of hemp products through vending machines and other means of distribution. In 2020, it became clear that the Sweet Hemp Alabama share exchange should not be closed because Sweet Hemp could not meet their closing obligations, so the Company began to unwind the contract. Majority voting control of the Company was changed again in March of 2020 when shares were issued to consultants who were hired by the Company to help identify top tier merger candidates as potential acquisition candidates. 4 Table of Contents After a renewed search process, on December 13, 2021, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with Gladiator Solutions, Inc. and certain shareholders of Gladiator, and the Company acquired a majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Gladiator in exchange for a new issuance of Company common stock to the Gladiator shareholders. On June 11, 2022, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with United Security Specialists, Inc. and the shareholders of USS, and the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of USS in exchange for a new issuance of Company common stock. The Company continues to aggressively pursue a growth by acquisition model and is currently identifying other potentially attractive M A candidates in the private security and personal protective equipment industries, as well as in other business verticals that management deems to be of strategic importance. Our Business As mentioned above, the Company is currently pursuing an aggressive growth strategy through M A through strategic acquisition in the private security, personnel protective equipment and defense industries. Through our subsidiaries, James Maritime Holdings, Inc. is well positioned to be at the forefront of personal protective products, private security and government contracting. The strategic acquisition of Gladiator Solutions, Inc. made us a leading personal protective product and technology company with an established line of trusted body armor, ballistic plates and ballistic materials. The timing for this acquisition was well timed to take advantage of an expansion in demand for these products as a result of the recent fighting in the Ukraine and our efforts to supply our allies with lifesaving personal protective equipment. By exporting our products during this critical time, we are able to boost sales and brand recognition for the Gladiator line of ballistics plates while also expanding revenues for additional strategic acquisitions in the defense space. Shortly after closing our transaction with Gladiator, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire United Security Specialists, Inc., a leading private security company with licenses in California and key guard service contracts for armed and unarmed security services. USS is a recognized industry leader in this rapidly growing market, and this acquisition positions well for potentially uncertain times ahead where security and protective services will be increasingly shifted onto the private security industry. As this segment of the market continues to expand, we will be able to leverage the Gladiator product line for any contracts that require armed security with ballistic plates, or whenever our private security clients have security teams that require ballistic plates. We hope to continue this trend as we expand into other security industry verticals as we identify additional acquisition candidates with disruptive, transformative or high technology defense systems and products that we can market to our existing client based at an affordable cost. We will continue to identify acquisition candidates with existing or developmental technologies for unmanned systems, space and satellite communications, electronic warfare and Command, Control, Communication, Computing, Combat, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance C5ISR Systems. Increasingly complicated compliance requirements and capital requirements will ensure that the barriers to entry in this space remain high, and we anticipate that upcoming requirements like Cyber Security Maturity Model Certification will force small businesses out of this space and away from defense contracting because they will not be able to justify the time and capital required to bid on government contracts. Moreover, the challenges with hiring quality guards, and the costs of insurance and inflation will continue to force a consolidation in the private security industry as poorly run security companies are forced out of the business. Industry Background In 2022, the U.S. increased its National Security Budget by 5.6 to 782,000,000,000 for Fiscal Year 2022 and approved 813,300,000,000 for Fiscal Year 2023 representing an additional 4 . In May 2022, the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022, was approved providing an additional 40,000,000,000 to help support the Ukraine. Meanwhile, according to a research study published to Globe Newswire by The Insight Partners 1 , the homeland security market is expected to grow in size from a value of 188,990,000,000 in 2022 to 275,500,000,000 by 2028 representing a compound annual growth rate of 6.5 . Management for the Company believes that the best way to capture this growing market is by aggressively expanding our operations through acquisition. About Gladiator Solutions, Inc. Gladiator Solutions Inc. was originally developed by Law Enforcement and Military Personnel with one simple idea to ensure the highest level of safety and comfort, at an affordable price. Our key emphasis is to provide our customers with lighter, safer and more affordable solutions that have greater ballistic capability. Our full line of hard armor plates, tactical ballistic plate carriers, soft armor inserts and vests, helmets, shields, and other ballistic products and accessories incorporate the latest materials and technology to ensure maximum protection and performance. _______________________________ 1 https://www.theinsightpartners.com/reports/homeland-security-market 5 Table of Contents Gladiator is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of personal protective systems. Whether for local law enforcement, federal and state agencies or the military, our High-Performance Polyethylene (HPPE) and hybrid UHMWP/Ceramic armor provides the highest level of protection at the lightest weight. Gladiator products are leading the way with ultimate protection, extreme comfort, minimal weight products at unsurpassed value. Gladiator products are tested and certified in accordance with protocols developed by the National Institute of Justice, US Military Specification and European Ballistics Standards. Gladiator proudly employs retired Law Enforcement and Military personnel across virtually all functional areas within the Gladiator organization including Sales Marketing, Distribution, Operations, Product Development/Innovation and Tactical Training. What Sets Gladiator Apart? We offer top quality solutions for Federal, State and Local Law Enforcement agencies, First Responders, National Armed forces, and Independent Security Contractors. Unsurpassed Quality Value Our products provide extreme lightweight, incredible comfort, maximum strength solutions at affordable prices, without compromising performance, durability or quality. Round Dispersion Technology (RDT) Our ballistic plates absorb the round rather than deflecting/spalling like steel or fracturing like Ceramic. RDT spreads the kinetic energy delivered by the round from the point of impact to the surrounding area, diffusing the forces of impact over a larger area and dispersing the force of the round impact. Testing Protocol To ensure the highest quality solutions, we age, test and certify our NIJ Special Threat plates to and beyond certification standards. This enables Gladiator to warranty our plates to 10 years vs. the industry standard 5 years. While most testing is conducted with the widest spread for impact points (to reduce the kinetic energy absorbed by the armor material),we target the smallest area possible with the highest concentration of kinetic energy in a localized area of impact, providing Gladiator with the confidence that we are providing the highest strength to weight ratio solution to our customers. 6 Table of Contents Materials Composition Our products are manufactured from high strength, high durability materials. The performance of these materials enables Gladiator to provide a 10-year warranty. While other products tend to break down over time, our products are manufactured from Polyethylene and Ceramic materials, providing a long and unsurpassed service life. Compliance We conduct our sales in accordance with Department of Justice (DOJ), the Commerce Department and the Department of State ruled governing all export controls including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR). Customer Satisfaction Our customer service is industry leading, delivering products within 4-6 weeks of order and providing timely updates throughout the production process. Gladiator s Capabilities In addition to providing the highest quality ballistic protection, Gladiator also offers a full arrangement of tactical outfitting and equipment from some of the most respected brands in the industry.

Our clients should expect day-to-day quality, consistency, and professionalism. Our security personnel are more experienced, better supervised, and are dedicated to the highest level of work. USS History USS was built on ethics and integrity. Kyle and Henry founded this company in 2017 when they discovered a number of industry practices that were neither ethical nor acceptable. Since both of them had been around in this industry for decades, starting USS was an exciting endeavor that had allowed them to utilize and combine their years of experience with their solid work ethic and integrity. We value every client that has partnered with us, and we work to establish a solid relationship with our team. It is the strong relationship bonds that help our company continue to grow and to serve more valued partners. Our Guards We have highly trained and committed professionals from law enforcement, military, and security veterans communities who are all specializing in providing one thing: on site, visible protection. We take pride in delivering the highest level of trust to our clients; therefore, we have a robust qualifying process to ensure all our team members are not just qualified but also enthusiastic and professional. Our Services We pride ourselves in providing the most reliable protection in the security guard industry. With over 10 years of experience, we have proven to be unshakable and trustworthy. To enhance our service, we implement the latest technology into our process. With our mobile app provided by SilverTrac, our guards are able to check in, make reports and take photos in real time as they patrol. USS will also focus on adding services which customize real-time remote monitoring enhanced by artificial intelligence with timely in person security response. USS services are grouped into three main categories: 1) On Site Protection 2) Mobile Patrol 3) Event Security ___________________________________________________________________________________ On Site Protection As a trusted provider of security specialists in the Bay Area, we understand the importance of reliable, professional and courteous security service, especially when it involves on-site protection at your establishment. Regardless of the scale of your need, from a single guard at the reception area to deploying multiple teams of officers for warehouse protection, USS will provide your organization with a solution that fits for you and your team. 8 Table of Contents Starting with our risk assessment framework, our expertise is in efficiently and effectively developing solutions that match different combinations of business environments and their specific security needs. ___________________________________________________________________________________ Mobile Patrol Having security specialists check in on your property on a scheduled route is a prevalent approach for many businesses that do not require a constant on-site presence. Our risk assessment team will help determine the most appropriate time frame and frequency of the patrolling route. Our licensed security specialists will carry out all of the inspection procedures designed specifically for your site according to plan. All activities are updated through our proprietary real-time reporting and location-tracking technology. We pride ourselves in utilizing the latest technology to enhance our services. With our mobile app provided by SilverTrac, our guards are able to check in, file incident reports and take photos in real time as they patrol. ___________________________________________________________________________________ Event Security 9 Table of Contents USS has an outstanding track record as a top tier event security partner. We have solid experience with security and crowd control at major concerts, outdoors events and convention center programs. Our specialists are well-trained for large events so they can easily identify potential threats and mitigate them to avoid interruptions and disturbances. With USS as your partner, you can focus on the event agenda knowing that your employees and guests are safe, litigation risk is reduced, and your event will go off without a hitch. ___________________________________________________________________________________ Our Competitive Strengths Our competitive edge in the security industry lies in our in-field support and quality control through responsiveness to customers, investment in field, our supervisors and our administrative support. For guard services, this allows us to minimize the #1 strategic risk for our industry, which is litigation risk. Another competitive advantage that we have is our access to a pipeline of highly professional, military-trained and experienced personnel for our high-end clients facing significant threats such as synagogues and schools. In the protective products industry, our strength is the unsurpassed quality and value of our products. Not only are our products light weight and comfortable, but we are able to provide the maximum level of ballistic protection at affordable prices, and without compromising performance, durability or quality. Our desire to drive innovation and create ever lighter, stronger, more practical and effective products and protection solutions is what drives us. As a lean, flexible and nimble company, we are constantly challenging the status quo within our organization, and we are never set in our ways. Through innovation we are able to deliver a lighter, thinner and more effective for ballistic protective plate for law enforcement, military and responsible civilians. We are always working harder to strengthening the Gladiator community by raising our standards of customer service and overall customer satisfaction. Our team is an industry leader in customer service, and we achieve this by delivering products much faster that our competition, usually within 4-6 weeks while providing timely updates throughout the production process. Our Growth and Marketing Strategy We believe that those who protect and serve and risk their lives to preserve our way of life, shouldn t have to spend a fortune to protect themselves. Matt Materazo, Founder CEO The elements of our growth strategy start with our commitment to continuous capital reinvestment into our Company, its subsidiaries and our strategic industry partners. We lead by example and set the pace for our industry in order to attract the leading regional security companies and protective products companies to join us as stakeholders. The core of our business growth strategy is to engage directly with our community stakeholders in growing urban markets where the breakdown of cultural values and community investment has left a vacuum of need. Risks Associated with Our Business Our business is subject to numerous risks, which are more fully described in the section entitled Risk Factor beginning on page 14 of this document. We may be unable, for many reasons, including those that are beyond our control, to implement our business strategy. As a result of these risks and other risks there is no guarantee that we will experience growth or profitability in the future. 10 Table of Contents Recent Developments There are several trends that provide opportunities and risks for USS: o The breakdown and underfunding of traditional law enforcement leading to passive response to riots, resulting break-ins, shoplifting, and property destruction on the large scale (See Portland 2020). o The rise of the lawless corollary on the small scale with burgeoning vagrancy, break-ins and theft (e.g., catalytic converters in automobiles, construction materials such as tools and copper conduit). o The refusal of cities to enforce vagrancy laws and suppress the crime associated with chronic criminal trespassing and its detrimental effect on business. This leads to a transfer of burden to business owners who turn to private security companies to mitigate. This applies to all sectors residential, commercial and municipal. o Finally, the sense of personal physical risk has been heightened in culture leading to the need to provide protection to employees and residents. For example, employees want protection as they come and go to their vehicle in areas of high crime.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Use of Estimates The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management makes estimates that affect certain accounts including deferred income tax assets, accrued expenses, fair value of equity instruments and reserves for any other commitments or contingencies. Any adjustments applied to estimates are recognized in the period in which such adjustments are determined. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards.

The note accords the issuer an option to convert, either in part or in entirety, the outstanding principal or accrued interest into fully paid and non-assessable common shares of the Company. The conversion price is determined as the lower of 10 of the lowest trading price observed during the five-trading day period concluding on the conversion date per share. The note permits the issuer to convert outstanding amounts into the Company s common shares under specific terms. Funds raised were used for general corporate purposes. This transaction was executed in accordance with Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D, specifically Rule 504 and or Rule 701, without the engagement of underwriters. 12 Table of Contents On February 26, 2021, Gladiator entered into another note agreement with Pink Holdings LLC. Under this agreement, the Company procured 25,000, subject to an annual interest rate of 6 and maturing on February 25, 2022. The issuer retains the prerogative to convert any portion or the full outstanding amount of principal or interest into the Company s fully paid and non-assessable common shares. The conversion rate is pegged at the lower of 10 of the lowest trading price during the trading day concluding on the conversion date per share. As of December 31, 2022, these notes remain unconverted and are past their respective due dates. Funds raised were allocated for general corporate purposes. This transaction complied with Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D, Rule 504 and or Rule 701, without the involvement of underwriters. On April 9, 2021, the Company issued 50,000 shares at 0.50 per share, collecting 25,000. The funds were used for general corporate purposes and to finance the acquisition of Gladiator and USS.

This transaction was executed in accordance with Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D, Rule 504 and or Rule 701, without the involvement of underwriters. On September 23, 2021, subsequent to the resignation of Mr. Sierra from his position with USS, the Company entered into an agreement to repurchase 100 shares of its common stock previously held by Mr. Sierra. In consideration for the repurchase of the aforementioned shares, USS provided Mr. Sierra with a promissory note, initially valued at 637,500. The repurchase amount was subsequently reduced by an aggregate of 405,545, attributable to distributions previously made by the Company to Mr. Sierra, effectively serving as consideration for the repurchase and cancellation of a corresponding portion of the debt. Consequently, the residual amount, as documented in the promissory note, is 231,955. This note does not bear interest and is structured with monthly installment payments over a four-year term, with the inaugural payment slated for November 15, 2021. Prior to USS s acquisition by James Maritime, the promissory note was discounted at a rate of 6 . However, in light of the acquisition, the note s value was adjusted and recognized at its fair value, which amounted to 182,773. As of the close of the fiscal year on December 31, 2022, the promissory note s outstanding principal is recorded at 168,276. The funds were used for general corporate purposes. The transaction was carried out in compliance with Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D, Rule 504 and or Rule 701, without the involvement of underwriters. On December 23, 2022, Gladiator entered into an agreement wherein the Company received a consideration of 50,000 in exchange for the commitment to issue 50,000 common shares to an officer of the Company. Notably, as of the fiscal year-end on December 31, 2022, these shares had not yet been formally issued. Consequently, in light of the deferred issuance, the transaction was recorded as a liability rather than as an equity transaction on the Company s financial statements for the period ending December 31, 2022. The raised funds were allocated for general corporate purposes. The share commitment was executed in accordance with Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D, Rule 504 and or Rule 701, without the engagement of underwriters. On February 28, 2022, the Company issued 50,000 shares of common stock at 1 per share to an officer, raising 50,000.

On September 23, 2022, in alignment with a stock-exchange agreement leading to the acquisition of United Security Solutions, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares at 1 per share.

Gladiator specializes in the distribution of personal protective products, largely through mail-in orders and e-commerce channels. On the other hand, USS offers a combination of professional security personnel services, enhanced by smartphone-based security applications, providing a unique blend of traditional and modern security solutions. The consolidated financial statements were prepared according to U.S. GAAP and SEC regulations. The Company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year-end for financial statement reporting. The financial statements were prepared with estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. These estimates were used for inventories, impairment of long-term assets, and derivatives. The actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Business combinations were accounted for using the acquisition method. Assets, liabilities, and any remaining non-controlling interests were recognized at fair value on the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests, was recognized as goodwill. The company considers investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the purchase date as cash and cash equivalents. Recent Developments During the past two fiscal years, the company underwent significant corporate changes. Share Exchange Agreements and Stock Conversions James Maritime solidified its position in the market by becoming the majority shareholder of Gladiator Solutions Inc., holding approximately 86.7 of all shares outstanding as of December 13, 2021. The acquisition of Gladiator Solutions, Inc. resulted in the issuance of 866,667 shares and brought the total common stock balance to 7,354,129 by the end of 2021. Furthermore, on September 23, 2022, the company fortified its portfolio by completing a share exchange agreement with USS, resulting in James Maritime securing 100 of all USS shares. The acquisition of USS resulted in the issuance of 1,000,000 shares by the end of 2022, and the common stock balance reached 9,004,129. Additional paid-in capital also saw a significant increase to 13,656,447, reflecting the stock issuances and compensations during the year. There were multiple issuances of common stock for diverse purposes, ranging from shareholder-related issuances to share-based compensations and acquisitions. In 2021, our preferred stock decreased from 2,000,000 to 400,000 shares. This decrease was primarily due to the conversion of preferred stock to common stock. Specifically, 1,600,000 shares of preferred stock were converted, leading to the issuance of 750,000 shares of common stock. Total shareholders equity, which includes both equity attributable to the company and non-controlling interest, increased from 419,248 at the end of 2021 to 2,182,693 by the end of 2022. Going concern The Company s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022, are prepared using U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. This contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The Company has yet to establish an ongoing source of revenue to finance its operating expenses and to continue as a going concern. Although the Company generated net income of 204,894 during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated an operating loss of 2,313,262. The net income generated was mainly caused by 3 million received for the employee retention credit during 2022. The accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2022 is 11,454,076 11,658,970 as of December 31, 2021). In order to continue as a going concern, the Company plans to receive funds through the selling of equity securities to existing and new shareholders. The Company is also evaluating potential acquisitions in the corporate security space. Additionally, the Company has created and maintained good customer relationships during 2022 for both USS and Gladiator, which the Company is relying on to potentially generate sustainable sales throughout 2023 and afterward. While management maintains they will be able to continue to generate sufficient cash flows through a combination of operations, debt, and equity raises, there is no guarantee the Company will be able to raise or generate additional funds in the short term to meet present obligations as they come due. Due to these factors, there is substantial doubt the Company may be able to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Results of Operations Years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 For the year ending December 31, 2022, the Company had net sales of 4,063,122, in contrast to 1,979 in 2021. Accounts receivables reached 722,367 as of December 31, 2022, marking an increase from the absence of any reported receivables as of December 31, 2021. This resulted from a growth in credit sales and longer collection durations in 2022. Intangible assets increased by 2,772,010 from 1,378,270 in 2021 to 4,150,280 in 2022 as a result of the Gladiator and USS acquisitions. Collectively, the assets of the Company expanded from 1,488,730 as of December 31, 2021 to 5,774,808 as of December 31, 2022. 15 Table of Contents Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by 631,966 year over year. Deferred revenue, from advanced payments or unearned revenue, also saw an increase of 230,000 in 2022. Liabilities increased significantly from 1,069,482 as of December 31, 2021 to 3,592,115 as of December 31, 2022. Cost of Revenue The cost of goods sold for 2022 was 3,213,604, reflecting the heightened sales activities, compared to just 82 in 2021. This growth in sales resulted from enhanced business operations and an expanded customer base as a result of global volatility and military conflicts in 2022. General and Administrative Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 3,162,780 in 2022, in comparison to 764,257 in 2021. General and administrative expenses increased mainly due to accounting and legal expenses and administrative expenses resulting from our rapid growth via the acquisition of Gladiator and USS. Other Income and Expenses There was a gain from employee retention credits amounting to 2,959,811 and a gain on settlement of 398,922 in 2022. However, these gains were offset by interest expenses of 766,579 and financial expenses of 158,797, among other costs. In total, the net other income for 2022 was 2,426,707, a significant increase from net other expense of 3,667 in 2021. Net loss and Net Gain The Company reported a net income of 113,445 for 2022, compared to a net loss of 766,027 in 2021. After accounting for the net loss attributable to non-controlling interests, the net income attributable to James Maritime Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries for 2022 was 204,894, in contrast to a net loss of 761,727 in 2021. On a per-share basis, the basic and diluted net loss for 2022 was 0.03 and 0.02, respectively, compared to a net loss per share of 0.21 in both basic and diluted terms for 2021. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reported net cash provided by operating activities of 178,269, up from 16,215 in 2021. This increase can be mainly attributed to the net income of 113,445 reported in 2022, as opposed to the net loss of 766,027 in 2021. Other significant non-cash adjustments in 2022 included the amortization of intangible assets of 780,086, depreciation expenses, and share-based compensation for services amounting to 300,000. Changes in working capital, notably a decrease in accounts receivable by 515,834 and an increase in deferred revenue by 230,000, also impacted cash flows from operating activities. Investing Activities In 2022, the net cash provided by investing activities was 9,637, primarily due to the cash acquired from the acquisition of United Security Specialists, Inc. (USS) of 21,437, offset by an acquisition of property and equipment of 11,800. In comparison, in 2021, the Company had net cash inflows of 60,349 from investing activities, predominantly from the cash acquired from the acquisition of Gladiator Solutions, Inc. Financing Activities Financing activities in 2022 resulted in a net cash inflow of 157,088. This was mainly due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock amounting to 350,000, proceeds from notes of 150,000, and proceeds from loans of 395,500. These inflows were partly offset by payments towards notes and loans, totaling 788,412. In 2021, the financing activities led to a net cash inflow of 19,968, primarily from the proceeds from the issuance of common stock. In summary, the Company experienced a net increase in cash of 344,994 in 2022, bringing the cash balance at the end of the year to 455,454. The cash position was 110,460 at the end of 2021. In addition to the standard cash flows, it s important to note the substantial non-cash activities. In 2022, the Company acquired USS through a share-exchange valued at 1,000,000. In 2021, the acquisition of Gladiator Solutions, Inc. through a share-exchange that was valued at 433,334. Going concern The Company s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022, are prepared using U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. This contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The Company has yet to establish an ongoing source of revenue to finance its operating expenses and to continue as a going concern. 16 Table of Contents Although the Company generated net income of 204,894 during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated an operating loss of 2,313,262.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The financial statements were prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit and has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue to finance its operating expenses. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. October 24, 2023 | Key Bank Tower at | 36 S.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. There are not and have not been any disagreements between the Company and its accountants on any matter of accounting principles, practices or financial statement disclosure. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures : As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K, management performed, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Due to resource constraints, material weaknesses are evident to management regarding our inability to generate all the necessary disclosure for inclusion in our filings with the Securities and Exchanges Commission, which is due to the lack of resources and segregation of duties. We lack sufficient personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in GAAP to meet the demands for a public company, including the accounting skills and understanding necessary to fulfill the requirements of GAAP-based reporting. This weakness causes us to not fully identify and resolve accounting and disclosure issues that could lead to a failure to perform timely internal control and reviews. In addition, the Company has not established an audit committee, does not have any independent outside directors on the Company s Board of Directors, and lacks documentation of its internal control processes. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting : Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The key internal controls for the Company are provided by executive management s review and approval of all transactions. Our internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal controls and procedures over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of these controls. Based on this assessment, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, weaknesses in our compliance with US GAAP and weaknesses in our risk assessment and monitoring. The Company lacks sufficient personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in GAAP to meet the demands for a public company, including the accounting skills and understanding necessary to fulfill the requirements of GAAP-based reporting. This weakness causes us to not fully identify and resolve accounting and disclosure issues that could lead to a failure to perform timely internal control and reviews. In addition, the Company has not established an audit committee, does not have any independent outside directors on the Company s Board of Directors, and lacks documentation of its internal control processes, management has concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 19 Table of Contents Attestation Report of the Independent Public Accounting Firm This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to applicable rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Corporate Governance by Board - Meetings, Committees and Audit Committee Financial Expert In general, Boards of Directors have responsibility for risk management responsibilities and establishing broad corporate policies and reviewing overall performance rather than day-to-day operations. Also, a primary responsibility of a Board is to oversee the management of the Company and, in doing so, serve the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Boards select, evaluate and provide for the succession of executive officers and, subject to stockholder election, directors. Boards review and approve corporate objectives and strategies and evaluate significant policies and proposed major commitments of corporate resources. Boards of Directors also participate in decisions that have a potential major economic impact on the Company. Management keeps directors informed of company activity through regular communication, including written reports and presentations at Board and committee meetings. We do not currently have regularly scheduled quarterly Board meetings, nor do we have standing audit, nominating or compensation committees of our Board of Directors, or any committee performing similar functions. Our Board of Directors performs the functions of audit, nominating and compensation committees. As of the date of this report, no member of our Board of Directors qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation SK promulgated under the Securities Act. The Company is evaluating expansion of its current Board of Directors, including the addition of an independent board member with sufficient accounting and financial experience to chair an audit committee, as well as creating charters for its contemplated audit committee and compensation committee. 22 Table of Contents Director Nominations As of December 31, 2022, we did not affect any material changes to the procedures by which our shareholders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. We have not established formal procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to the Company s board of directors. Code of Ethics We have adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, or persons performing similar functions. A copy of our code of ethics may be obtained free of charge by contacting us at the address or telephone number listed on the cover page hereof. Section 16 Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders (defined by statute as stockholders beneficially owning more than 10 of our common stock) to file with the SEC initial reports of beneficial ownership, and reports of changes in beneficial ownership, of our common stock. Directors, executive officers and significant stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on a review of the copies of Forms 3, 4 and 5 (and amendments thereto) filed with the SEC and submitted to us, and on written representations by certain directors and executive officers received by us, we believe that all of our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders complied with all applicable filing requirements under Section 16(a) during the year ended December 31, 2022.
