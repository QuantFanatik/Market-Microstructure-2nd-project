 CORPORATE HISTORY 
 
 All State Properties L.P., a limited partnership (the Partnership was organized under the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act of Delaware on April 27, 1984 to conduct the business formerly carried on by its predecessor corporation, All State Properties, Inc. (the Corporation and together with the Partnership, the Company . In March 2007 Hubei Longdan (Delaware), Inc. Longdan Delaware and Subsidiary was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Longdan Delaware had only nominal assets and no liabilities and had conducted no activities except in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement. The Company together with Longdan Delaware referred to herein as the Registrant . Pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation adopted by shareholders of the Corporation on September 30, 1984, the Corporation transferred substantially all of its assets to the Partnership, and the Corporation distributed such limited partnership interests to its shareholders.

 Since August 1999, the Company s only business has been the ownership of a member interest of approximately 35 in Tunicom LLC, a Florida limited liability company Tunicom ). An affiliate of Tunicom was engaged in the ownership and operation of an adult rental apartment complex until the sale of the apartment complex in August 2000.

 Upon the effectiveness and as a result of the Merger, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of ASPH became the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

Each product has an unconditional 30-day warranty, during which time the product can be returned for a complete refund. Customers can purchase extended warranties, which provide for replacement or repair of the unit beyond the period provided by the unconditional warranty. Warranties can be purchased for various periods but generally they are for one-year period that begins after any other warranties expire. The revenue from warranties is recognized on a straight-line bases over the period covered by the warranty. Prior to the issuance of financial statements management reviews any returns subsequent to the end of the accounting period which are from sales recognized during the accounting period and makes appropriate adjustments as necessary. Product prices are fixed or determinable and products are only shipped when collectability is reasonably assured. 
 
 Stock Based Compensation 
 
 We account for share-based compensation at fair value. Stock based compensation cost for stock options granted to employees, board members and service providers is determined at the grant date using an option pricing model.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 Board of Directors and Shareholders 
 Petro USA, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Petro USA, Inc. (the Company), which comprise the balance sheet as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 and the related statements of Operations, Changes in Stockholder s Equity, and Cash Flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements. In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United Sates) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we were required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluation of the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Going Concern Uncertainty 
 As shown in the financial statements, the Company incurred net losses of 23,863 during the year ended June 30, 2023 and accumulated losses of 121,825,555. These factors create an uncertainty as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of raising additional capital through the issuance of common stock and the ability to generate sufficient operating revenue. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 Emphasis of Matters-Risks and Uncertainties 
 
 The Company is not able to predict the ultimate impact that COVID -19 will have on its business. However, if the current economic conditions continue, the pandemic could have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries, including the geographical area in which the Company plans to operate. 
 
 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2023.

 Notes to Financial Statements 
 For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 

Fully diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic income (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of common stock equivalents (primarily outstanding options and warrants). 
 Common stock equivalents represent the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, using the treasury stock method, at either the beginning of the respective period presented or the date of issuance, whichever is later, and only if the common stock equivalents are considered dilutive based upon the Company s net income (loss) position at the calculation date.

No provision was made for federal income taxes as the Company has significant net operating losses.

 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. 
 
 GRIES AND ASSOCIATES, LLC 
 
 This decision to engage Gries and Associates, LLC was approved by our full Board of Directors. Because we have no standing audit committee, our full Board of Directors participated in and approved the decision to change independent accountants. Presently, the Board of Directors acts as the audit committee. 
 
 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of June 30, 2023. Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting for our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over our financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 
 (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairy reflect our transactions. 
 
 (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and 
 
 (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error or circumvention through collusion of improper overriding of controls. Therefore, even those internal control systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time. 
 
 Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO 2013 in Internal-Control-Integrated Framework and implemented a process to monitor and assess both the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls. Based on this assessment, management believes that as of June 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. 
 
 We have instituted a remediation plan which involves reeducating our management, the accounting staff, and the administrative staff as to the elements of a completed sale. We increased the oversight of the process by increasing the frequency of involvement of outside accounting consultants. Internal systems are being put into place to track and document significant dates, such as delivery, installation and customer acceptance. In addition, the bookkeeping system has been modified so that all sales of extended warranties are automatically recorded as deferred revenue and that the amount of revenue that is ultimately recognized as warranty revenue is as the result of an analysis of the significant aspects of the warranty such as coverage and period. 
 23 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 2023. In connection with such evaluation, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred since the beginning of our fourth quarter of 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. While there have been no changes, we have assessed our internal controls as being deficient and will be taking steps beginning in 2024 to remedy such deficiencies.

 Our Articles of Incorporation, as amended and restated, and our Bylaws provide for mandatory indemnification of our officers and directors, except where such person has been adjudicated liable by reason of his negligence or willful misconduct toward the Company or such other corporation in the performance of his duties as such officer or director. Our Bylaws also authorize the purchase of director and officer liability insurance to insure them against any liability asserted against or incurred by such person in that capacity or arising from such person's status as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or agent, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person under the applicable law. 
 
 Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
 
 We have not established a compensation committee. We are not currently subject to any law, rule or regulation requiring that we establish a compensation committee. During the last fiscal year, Mr. Gunther Than, an executive officer, participated in our board of directors' deliberations concerning executive officer compensation. 
 
 ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

 ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE. 
 
 We do not have a specific policy or procedure for the review, approval, or ratification of any transaction involving related persons. We historically have sought and obtained funding from officers, directors, and family members as these categories of persons are familiar with our management and often provide better terms and conditions than we can obtain from unassociated sources. Also, we are so small that having specific policies or procedures of this type would be unworkable.

 Audit Related Fees 
 
 Audit-related fees represent professional services rendered for assurance and related services by the principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements that are not reported under audit fees. 
 
 Tax Fees 
 
 Tax fees represent professional services rendered by the principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning. 
 
 All Other Fees 
 
 All other fees represent fees billed for products and services provided by the principal accountant, other than the services reported for the other categories. 
 
 PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES 
 
 Our audit committee does not rely on pre-approval policies and procedures. Typically, Management has sought out audit firm candidates and presented them to the audit committee. Before the auditor renders audit and non-audit services our board of directors approves the engagement.
