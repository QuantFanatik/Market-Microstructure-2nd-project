PART I

Item 1. Business 

Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. of Louisiana, a Louisiana chartered corporation Home Federal Bancorp or the Company ), is the holding company for Home Federal Bank Home Federal Bank or the Bank ). Home Federal
 Bank is a federally chartered stock savings bank originally organized in 1924 as Home Building and Loan Association. The Bank reorganized into the mutual holding company structure in January 2005 and changed its name to Home Federal Bank in
 2009 as part of its business strategy to be recognized as a community bank. Home Federal Bank s home office and ten full service branch offices are located in Caddo, Bossier and Webster Parishes, Louisiana and serve the Shreveport-Bossier
 City-Minden combined statistical area. In February 2023, the Bank acquired First National Bank of Benton and its full service branch office in Benton, Louisiana. Home Federal Bank s business primarily consists of attracting deposits from the
 general public and using those funds to originate loans.

As of June 30, 2023, Home Federal Bancorp s only business activities are to hold all of the outstanding common stock of Home Federal Bank. Home Federal Bancorp is authorized to pursue other business activities
 permitted by applicable laws and regulations for savings and loan holding companies, which may include the issuance of additional shares of common stock to raise capital or to support mergers or acquisitions and borrowing funds for reinvestment
 in Home Federal Bank.

Home Federal Bancorp does not own or lease any property but instead uses the premises, equipment, and furniture of Home Federal Bank. At the present time, Home Federal Bancorp employs only persons who are officers of
 Home Federal Bank to serve as officers of Home Federal Bancorp and may also use the support staff of Home Federal Bank from time to time. These other persons are not separately compensated by Home Federal Bancorp.

Pursuant to the regulations under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, Home Federal Bank and Home Federal Bancorp have entered into an expense sharing agreement. Under this agreement, Home Federal Bancorp
 will reimburse Home Federal Bank for the time that employees of Home Federal Bank devote to activities of Home Federal Bancorp, the portion of the expense of the annual independent audit attributable to Home Federal Bancorp, and all expenses
 attributable to Home Federal Bancorp s public filing obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Market Area

Our primary market area for loans and deposits is in northwest Louisiana, particularly Caddo Parish and neighboring communities in Bossier and Webster Parishes, which are located in the Shreveport-Bossier City-Minden
 combined statistical area.

Our primary market area in northern Louisiana has a diversified economy with employment in services, government, and wholesale/retail trade constituting the basis of the local economy, with service jobs being the
 largest component. The majority of the services are health care related as Shreveport has become a regional hub for health care. The casino gaming industry also supports a significant number of the service jobs. The energy sector has a prominent
 role in the regional economy, resulting from oil and gas exploration and drilling.

Competition. We face significant competition both in attracting deposits and in making loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has come historically from commercial
 banks, credit unions, and other savings institutions located in our primary market area, including many large financial institutions which have greater financial and marketing resources available to them. In addition, we face significant
 competition for investors funds from short-term money market securities, mutual funds, and other corporate and government securities. We do not rely upon any individual group or entity for a material portion of our deposits. Our ability to
 attract and retain deposits depends on our ability to generally provide a rate of return, liquidity, and risk comparable to that offered by competing investment opportunities.

Our competition for real estate loans comes principally from mortgage banking companies, commercial banks, other savings institutions, and credit unions. We compete for loan originations primarily through the
 interest rates and loan fees we charge and the efficiency and quality of services we provide borrowers. Factors which affect competition include general and local economic conditions, current interest rate levels, and volatility in the mortgage
 markets. Competition may increase as a result of the continuing reduction of restrictions on the interstate operations of financial institutions.

Lending Activities

General. At June 30, 2023, our net loan portfolio amounted to 489.5 million, representing approximately 74.1 of total assets at that date. Historically, our principal
 lending activity was the origination of one-to-four family residential loans. At June 30, 2023, one-to-four family residential loans amounted to 179.6 million, or 36.7 of the total loan portfolio. In recent periods, we have sold a substantial
 amount of our fixed-rate conforming one-to-four family residential loans to correspondent banks. Commercial real estate loans amounted to 148.4 million, or 30.3 of the total loan portfolio, at June 30, 2023.

The types of loans that we may originate are subject to federal and state laws and regulations. Interest rates charged on loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for
 lending purposes, and the rates offered by our competitors. These factors are, in turn, affected by general and economic conditions, the monetary policy of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve Board, legislative and tax policies,
 and governmental budgetary matters.

A savings institution generally may not make loans to one borrower and related entities in an amount which exceeds 15 of its unimpaired capital and surplus, although loans in an amount equal to an additional 10 of
 unimpaired capital and surplus may be made to a borrower, if the loans are fully secured by readily marketable securities. In addition, upon application, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency permits a savings institution to lend up to an
 additional 15 of unimpaired capital and surplus to one borrower to develop domestic residential housing units. At June 30, 2023, our regulatory limit on loans to one borrower was 7.6 million, and the five largest loans or groups of loans to one
 borrower, including related entities, aggregated 7.4 million, 5.8 million, 4.6 million, 4.4 million, and 4.4 million. Each of our five largest loans or groups of loans was originated with strong guarantor support to known borrowers in our
 market area and was performing in accordance with its terms at June 30, 2023.

Loans to or guaranteed by general obligations of a state or political subdivision are not subject to the foregoing lending limits.

Origination of Loans. Our lending activities are subject to written underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the board of directors and
 management. When applicable, loans originated are also subject to the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, VA, USDA, and correspondent banks that purchase loans we originate. Loan originations are obtained through a variety of
 sources, primarily from existing customers, local realtors, and builders. Written loan applications are taken by one of our loan officers. The loan officer also supervises the procurement of credit reports, income and asset documentation, and
 other documentation involved with a loan. All appraisals are ordered through an approved appraisal management company in compliance with the Dodd-Frank Consumer Protection Act. Under our lending policy, a title insurance policy is required on
 most mortgage loans, with the exception of certain smaller loan amounts where our policy requires a title opinion only. We also require fire and extended coverage casualty insurance in order to protect the properties securing the real estate
 loans. Borrowers must also obtain flood insurance policies when the property is in a flood hazard area.

Our loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan, and the value of the property that will secure the loan. All residential loans originated for sale
 to FNMA or other investor banks that receive an Approve-Eligible recommendation on the automated underwriting feedback certificate that is applicable for each loan type must be approved by a Bank mortgage underwriter. Loans that do not receive an
 Approve-Eligible recommendation must be approved by a Bank mortgage underwriter and the Senior Vice President of Mortgage. In addition, all loans originated to be held on the Bank s portfolio must be approved by a Bank mortgage underwriter and
 the Senior Vice President of Mortgage for loans up to 500,000, and for loans up to 1.0 million by the Senior Credit Officer. Commercial real estate secured loans and lines of credit and commercial business loans up to 1.0 million must be
 approved by the Senior Credit Officer or the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, up to 2.0 million by the Senior Credit Officer and the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and in excess of 2.0
 million by the Executive Committee. In accordance with past practice, all loans are ratified by our board of directors.

Although federal laws and regulations permit savings institutions to originate and purchase loans secured by real estate located throughout the United States, we concentrate our lending activity in our primary market
 area in Caddo, Bossier and Webster Parishes, Louisiana and the surrounding area. Subject to our loans-to-one borrower limitation, we are permitted to invest without limitation in residential mortgage loans and up to 400 of our capital in loans
 secured by non-residential or commercial real estate. We also may invest in secured and unsecured consumer loans in an amount not exceeding 35 of total assets. This 35 limitation may be exceeded for certain types of consumer loans, such as home
 equity and property improvement loans secured by residential real property. In addition, we may invest up to 10 of our total assets in secured and unsecured loans for commercial, corporate, business, or agricultural purposes. At June 30, 2023,
 we were within each of the above lending limits.

During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we sold 24.9 million and 87.2 million of loans, respectively. We recognized gain on sale of loans of 466,000 and 2.0 million during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Loans were sold
 during these periods primarily to other financial institutions. Such loans were sold against forward sales commitments with servicing released and without recourse after a certain period of time, typically 90 days. The loans sold primarily
 consisted of long-term, fixed rate residential real estate loans. These loans were originated during this period of historically low interest rates and were sold to reduce our interest rate risk. We will continue to sell loans in the future to
 the extent we believe the interest rate environment is unfavorable and interest rate risk is unacceptable.

Scheduled contractual maturities of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual expected term of the loan portfolio. The average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their average contractual terms
 because of prepayments. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan rates are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and, conversely, decrease when rates on current mortgage loans are lower than existing
 mortgage loan rates (due to refinancing of adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans at lower rates). Under the latter circumstance, the weighted average yield on loans decreases as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates.

One-to-Four Family Residential Real Estate Loans. At June 30, 2023, 179.6 million, or 30.3 , of the total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of one-to-four family
 residential loans.

The loan-to-value ratios, maturities, and other provisions of the loans made by us generally have reflected the policy of making less than the maximum loan permissible under applicable regulations, in accordance with
 sound lending practices, market conditions, and underwriting standards established by us. Our current lending policy on one-to-four family residential loans generally limits the maximum loan-to-value ratio to 90 or less of the appraised value of
 the property, although we will lend up to a 100 loan-to-value ratio with private mortgage insurance. These loans are amortized on a monthly basis with principal and interest due each month, terms not in excess of 30 years, and generally include
 due-on-sale clauses.

At June 30, 2023, 142.5 million, or 79.3 , of our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans were fixed-rate loans. Fixed-rate loans generally have maturities ranging from 15 to 30 years and are fully amortizing
 with monthly loan payments sufficient to repay the total amount of the loan with interest by the end of the loan term. Our fixed-rate loans generally are originated under terms, conditions, and documentation which permit them to be sold to U.S.
 Government-sponsored agencies, such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and other investors in the secondary mortgage market. Consistent with our asset/liability management, we have sold a significant portion of our long-term, fixed
 rate loans. Servicing is released on all loans sold except those loans sold to FNMA.

Although we offer adjustable rate loans, substantially all of the single-family loan originations over the last few years have consisted of fixed-rate loans due to the low interest rate environment. The
 adjustable-rate loans held in portfolio typically have interest rates which adjust on an annual basis. These loans generally have an annual cap of 1 on any increase or decrease and a cap of 6 above or below the initial rate over the life of the
 loan. Such loans are underwritten based on the initial rate plus 2 . At June 30, 2023, 37.1 million, or 20.7 , of our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans were adjustable rate loans.

Commercial Real Estate Secured Loans. As of June 30, 2023, Home Federal Bank had outstanding 148.4 million of loans secured by commercial real estate, 105.0 million, or 70.7 , of which were owner occupied. It is the current policy of Home Federal Bank to lend in a first lien position on real property occupied as a commercial business
 property. Home Federal Bank offers fixed and variable rate commercial real estate loans. Home Federal Bank s commercial real estate loans are limited to a maximum of 85 of the appraised value and have terms up to 15 years, however, the terms
 are generally no more than five years with amortization periods of 20 years or less. It is our policy that commercial real estate secured lines of credit are limited to a maximum of 85 of the appraised value of the property and shall not
 exceed three to five year amortizations. 

Multi-Family Residential Loans. At June 30, 2023, we had outstanding approximately 28.8 million of multi-family residential loans. Our multi-family residential loan portfolio
 includes income producing properties of five or more units and low income housing developments. We obtain personal guarantees on all properties other than those of the public housing authority for which they are not permitted.

Commercial Business Loans. At June 30, 2023, we had outstanding approximately 55.4 million of non-real estate secured commercial loans. The business lending products we offer
 include lines of credit, inventory financing, and equipment loans. Commercial business loans and lines of credit carry more credit risk than other types of commercial loans. We attempt to limit such risk by making loans predominantly to small-
 and mid-sized businesses located within our market area and having the loans personally guaranteed by the principals involved. We have established underwriting standards in regard to business loans which set forth the criteria for sources of
 repayment, borrower s capacity to repay, specific financial and collateral margins, and financial enhancements such as guarantees. The primary source of repayment is cash flow from the business and the general financial strength of the borrower.

Land Loans. As of June 30, 2023, land loans were 26.8 million, or 5.4 , of the total loan portfolio, before net items. Land loans include land which has been acquired for the
 purpose of development and unimproved land. Our loan policy provides for loan-to-value ratios of 50 for unimproved land loans. Land loans are originated with fixed rates and terms up to five years with longer amortizations. Although land loans
 generally are considered to have greater credit risk than certain other types of loans, we expect to mitigate such risk by requiring personal guarantees and identifying other secondary sources of repayment for the land loan other than the sale of
 the collateral. It is our practice to only originate a limited amount of loans for speculative development to borrowers with whom our lenders have a prior relationship.

Construction Loans. At June 30, 2023, we had outstanding approximately 28.0 million, or 5.7 , of construction loans which included loans for the construction of residential
 and commercial property. Our residential construction loans typically have terms of six to twelve months with a takeout letter from Home Federal for the permanent mortgage. Our commercial construction loans include owner occupied commercial
 properties, pre-sold property, and speculative office property. As of June 30, 2023, we held 315,000 of speculative construction loans.

Home Equity and Second Mortgage Loans. At June 30, 2023, we held 2.5 million of home equity and second mortgage loans. These loans are secured by the underlying equity in the
 borrower s residence. We do not require that we hold the first mortgage on the properties that secure the second mortgage loans. The amount of our second mortgage loans generally cannot exceed a loan-to-value ratio of 90 after taking into
 consideration the first mortgage loan. These loans are typically three-to-five year balloon loans with fixed rates and terms that will not exceed 10 years and contain an on-demand clause that allows us to call the loan in at any time.

Equity Lines of Credit. We offer lines of credit secured by a borrower s equity in real estate. These loans amounted to 23.8 million, or 4.8 of the total loan portfolio,
 before net items, at June 30, 2023. The unused portion of equity lines was 13.2 million at June 30, 2023. The rates and terms of such lines of credit depend on the history and income of the borrower, purpose of the loan, and collateral. Lines of
 credit will not exceed 90 of the value of the equity in the collateral.

Consumer Non-Real Estate Loans. We are authorized to make loans for a wide variety of personal or consumer purposes. We originate consumer loans primarily in order to
 accommodate our customers. The consumer loans at June 30, 2023 consist of loans secured by deposit accounts with us, automobile loans, overdraft, and other unsecured loans.

Consumer non-real estate loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than residential mortgage loans and generally entail greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly those loans
 secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as automobiles, boats, and recreational vehicles. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan, and
 the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In particular, amounts realizable on the sale of repossessed automobiles may be significantly reduced based upon the condition of the
 automobiles and the fluctuating demand for used automobiles.

We offer loans secured by deposit accounts held with us. These loans amounted to 372,000, or 0.07 of the total loan portfolio, before net items, at June 30, 2023. Such loans are originated for up to 100 of the
 account balance, with a hold placed on the account restricting the withdrawal of the account balance. The interest rate on the loan is equal to the interest rate paid on the account plus 2 . These loans typically are payable on demand with a
 maturity date of one year.

Loan Origination and Other Fees. In addition to interest earned on loans, we generally receive loan origination fees or points for originating loans. Loan points are a
 percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage loan and are charged to the borrower in connection with the origination of the loan. In accordance with accounting guidance, loan origination fees and points are deferred and amortized into
 income as an adjustment of yield over the life of the loan.

Asset Quality

General. 
 During fiscal 2023 our annual review commenced in August 2023 and is expected to be completed in October 202 3 . The scope of the services provided included testing of credit underwriting, adherence to our loan policies, as well as regulatory policies, and recommendations regarding reserve allocations. We expect
 these reviews will be done roughly every twelve to eighteen months . 

Our collection procedures provide that when a loan is 10 days past due personal contact efforts are attempted, either in person or by telephone. At 15 days past due, a late charge notice is sent to the borrower
 requesting payment. If the loan is still past due at 30 days, a formal letter is sent to the borrower stating that the loan is past due and that legal action, including foreclosure proceedings, may be necessary. If a loan becomes 60 days past due
 and no progress has been made in resolving the delinquency, a collection letter from legal counsel is sent and personal contact is attempted. When a loan continues in a delinquent status for 90 days or more, and a repayment schedule has not been
 made or kept by the borrower, generally a notice of intent to foreclose is sent to the borrower. If the delinquency is not cured, foreclosure proceedings are initiated. In most cases, deficiencies are cured promptly. While we generally prefer to
 work with borrowers to resolve such problems, we will institute foreclosure or other collection proceedings, when necessary, to minimize any potential loss.

Loans are placed on non-accrual status when management believes the probability of collection of interest is doubtful. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted
 from interest income. We generally discontinue the accrual of interest income when the loan becomes 90 days past due, as to principal or interest, unless the credit is well secured and we believe we will fully collect.

Real estate and other assets we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure are classified as real estate owned until sold. At June 30, 2023, we had 368,000 in other real estate owned
 consisting of two single family residences compared to none at June 30, 2022.

At June 30, 2023, the Company had 1.6 million of non-performing assets (defined as non-accruing loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past
 due, and other real estate owned) compared to 2.2 million of non-performing assets at June 30, 2022, consisting of seven single family residential loans, two commercial non-real estate loans, one consumer loan, and two single family
 residences in other real estate owned at June 30, 2023, compared to nine single family residential loans and one line of credit loan at June 30, 2022. The decrease in non-performing assets from 2.5 million at June 30, 2022 to 1.6 million
 at June 30, 2023 was primarily due to an improvement in loan credit quality at June 30, 2023. At June 30, 2023, the Company had ten single family residential loans, three commercial non-real estate loans, two commercial real estate loans,
 and three home equity line-of credit loans classified as substandard compared to five single family residential loans and two commercial real estate loans classified as substandard at June 30, 2022. There were no loans classified as
 doubtful at June 30, 2023 or 2022.

Classified Assets. Federal regulations require that
 each insured savings institution classify its assets on a regular basis and the amount of its valuation allowance is subject to review by Federal bank regulators. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard , doubtful ,
 and loss . Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss, if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the
 weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values questionable, and there is a higher possibility of
 loss. An asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. Another category designated special mention also must be established and maintained for
 assets which do not currently expose an insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification as substandard, doubtful, or loss. Assets classified as substandard or doubtful require the institution to establish general
 allowances for loan losses. If an asset, or portion thereof, is classified as loss, the insured institution must either establish specific allowances for loan losses in the amount of 100 of the portion of the asset classified loss, or
 charge-off such amount. General loss allowances established to cover possible losses related to assets classified substandard or doubtful may be included in determining an institution s regulatory capital, while specific valuation allowances
 for loan losses do not qualify as regulatory capital. Federal examiners may disagree with an insured institution s classifications and amounts reserved. At June 30, 2023, we had 7.1 million in classified assets. There were six residential
 mortgage loans designated as special mention for 810,000, six commercial non-real estate loans for 2.3 million and one auto loan for 1,000. There were seven residential mortgage loans totaling 2.2 million, five commercial real estate
 loans for 1.7 million, three home equity line-of-credit loans for 69,000, and one auto loan for 21,000 classified as substandard. There were no loans classified as doubtful or loss at June 30, 2023.

Allowance for Loan Losses. At June 30, 2023, our allowance for loan losses amounted to 5.2 million. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed, to the
 best of our knowledge, to cover all known and inherent losses in the portfolio, both probable and reasonable, to be estimated at each reporting date. The level of allowance for loan losses is based on our periodic review of the collectability of
 the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, and prevailing conditions. Historically,
 we have primarily engaged in originating single-family residential loans. Our management considers the deficiencies of all classified loans in determining the amount of allowance for loan losses required at each reporting date. Our management
 analyzes the probability of the correction of the substandard loans weaknesses and the extent of any known or inherent losses that we might sustain on them. During the fiscal year 2023, we recorded a provision for loan losses of 868,000, as
 compared to 336,000 recorded for fiscal year 2022.

The increase in the provision for fiscal year 2023 primarily reflects an overall
 growth in our loan portfolio. Total non-performing loans decreased by approximately 0.8 million as of June 30, 2023 compared to June 30, 2022. 

While management believes that it determines the size of the allowance based on the best information available at the time, the allowance will need to be adjusted as circumstances change and assumptions are updated.
 Future adjustments to the allowance could significantly affect net income.

The following table shows changes in our allowance for loan losses during the periods presented. We had 237,000 and 31,000 of loan charge-offs during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Bad debt recoveries amounted
 to 91,000 and 24,000 during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.

None of the listed equity securities has a stated maturity.

Our investment in equity securities consists primarily of FHLB stock and shares of First National Bankers Bankshares, Inc. FNBB ). Management monitors its investment portfolio to determine whether any investment
 securities which have unrealized losses should be considered other than temporarily impaired.

Mortgage-backed securities represent a participation interest in a pool of one-to-four family or multi-family mortgages. The mortgage originators use intermediaries (generally U.S. Government agencies and
 government-sponsored enterprises) to pool and repackage the participation interests in the form of securities, with investors receiving the principal and interest payments on the mortgages. Such U.S. Government agencies and government-sponsored
 enterprises guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors.

Mortgage-backed securities are typically issued with stated principal amounts, and the securities are backed by pools of mortgages that have loans with interest rates that are within a range and have varying
 maturities. The underlying pool of mortgages, i.e. , fixed-rate or adjustable-rate, as well as prepayment risk, are passed on to the certificate holder. The life of a mortgage-backed pass-through security
 approximates the life of the underlying mortgages.

Our mortgage-backed securities consist of Ginnie Mae securities GNMA ), Freddie Mac securities FHLMC ), and Fannie Mae securities FNMA ). Ginnie Mae is a government agency within the Department of Housing and
 Urban Development, which is intended to help finance government-assisted housing programs. Ginnie Mae securities are backed by loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Veterans Administration. The timely payment of
 principal and interest on Ginnie Mae securities is guaranteed by Ginnie Mae and backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Freddie Mac is a private corporation chartered by the U.S. Government. Freddie Mac issues participation
 certificates backed principally by conventional mortgage loans. Freddie Mac guarantees the timely payment of interest and the ultimate return of principal on participation certificates. Fannie Mae is a private corporation chartered by the U.S.
 Congress with a mandate to establish a secondary market for mortgage loans. Fannie Mae guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on Fannie Mae securities. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities are not backed by the full faith and
 credit of the U.S. Government. In September 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency was appointed as conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The U.S. Department of the Treasury agreed to provide capital, as needed, to ensure that Fannie Mae
 and Freddie Mac continue to provide liquidity to the housing and mortgage markets.

Mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than the loans which underlie such securities because of their payment guarantees or credit enhancements, which offer nominal credit risk. In addition, mortgage-backed
 securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize our borrowings or other obligations.

Sources of Funds

General. Deposits are our primary source of funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and investment
 securities are a source of funds. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings may also be used on a
 short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources and on a longer-term basis for general business purposes.

Deposits. We attract deposits principally from residents of Louisiana and particularly from Caddo, Webster, and Bossier Parishes. Deposit account terms vary, with the
 principal differences being the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate. We utilize brokered certificates of deposit as a component of our strategy for lowering the overall cost of funds.
 The brokered certificates of deposit are callable by Home Federal Bank after twelve months. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, we had 3.0 million and 6.0 million, respectively, in brokered certificates of deposit.

We establish interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees, and withdrawal penalties on a periodic basis. Management determines the rates and terms based on rates paid by competitors, the need for funds or
 liquidity, growth goals, and federal regulations. We attempt to control the flow of deposits by pricing our accounts to remain generally competitive with other financial institutions in the market area.

Borrowings. We may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas upon the security of the common stock we own in that bank and certain of our residential mortgage
 loans and mortgage-backed and other investment securities, provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. These advances are made pursuant to several credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of
 maturities. Federal Home Loan Bank advances are generally available to meet seasonal and other withdrawals of deposit accounts and to permit increased lending.

As of June 30, 2023, we were permitted to borrow up to an aggregate
 total of 212.2 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. We had no Federal Home Loan Bank advances outstanding at June 30, 2023 and 832,000 of advances at June 30, 2022. Additionally, at June 30, 2023, Home
 Federal Bank was a party to a Master Purchase Agreement with First National Bankers Bank whereby Home Federal Bank may purchase Federal Funds from First National Bankers Bank in an amount not to exceed 20.4 million. There were no
 amounts purchased under this agreement as of June 30, 2023. At June 30, 2023, Home Federal Bancorp had available an 10.0 million line of credit agreement with First National Bankers Bank, maturing July 3, 2023. The credit agreement
 maturing July 3, 2023 was renewed with a scheduled maturity of August 29, 2023. A new credit agreement was executed on August 29, 2023, maturing on August 29, 2024. The line is secured by Home Federal Bank s common stock and bears
 interest at the Prime Rate, which is subject to change when adjustments are made to Wall Street Journal Prime. At June 30, 2023, the line had an outstanding balance of 8.6 million.

REGULATION

General

Home Federal Bank, as a federally chartered savings bank, is subject to federal regulation and oversight by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency extending to all aspects of its operations. Home Federal Bank
 also is subject to regulation and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures the deposits of Home Federal Bank to the maximum extent permitted by law, and requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board.
 Federally chartered savings institutions are required to file periodic reports with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and are subject to periodic examinations by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit
 Insurance Corporation. The investment and lending authority of savings institutions is prescribed by federal laws and regulations, and such institutions are prohibited from engaging in any activities not permitted by such laws and regulations.
 Such regulation and supervision primarily are intended for the protection of depositors and not for the purpose of protecting shareholders.

Federal law provides the federal banking regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, with substantial enforcement powers. The Office of the
 Comptroller of the Currency s enforcement authority over all savings institutions includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders, and to initiate injunctive actions. In
 general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed
 with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Any change in these laws and regulations, whether by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on
 Home Federal Bancorp and Home Federal Bank and our operations.

2018 Regulatory Reform

In May 2018 the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the Act ), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under
 the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act ). While the Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory
 framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than 10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than 50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory relief for community banks such as Home Federal
 Bank.

The Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding
 companies with total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single Community Bank Leverage Ratio of between 8 and 10 percent to replace the leverage and risk-based regulatory
 capital ratios. This expansion also excludes such holding companies from the minimum capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call
 reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.

Regulation of Home Federal Bancorp

Home Federal Bancorp, a Louisiana corporation, is a registered savings and loan holding company within the meaning of Section 10 of the Home Owners Loan Act and is subject to examination and supervision by the
 Federal Reserve Board, as well as certain reporting requirements. While new capital requirements began to phase in for savings and loan holding companies on January 1, 2015, Home Federal Bancorp is currently exempt from those requirements. In
 addition, because Home Federal Bank is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, it is subject to certain restrictions in dealing with us and with other persons affiliated with the Bank.

Holding Company Acquisitions. Home Federal Bancorp is a savings and loan holding company under the Home Owners Loan Act, as amended. Federal law generally prohibits a savings
 and loan holding company, without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, from acquiring the ownership or control of any other savings institution or savings and loan holding company, or all, or substantially all, of the assets, or more than
 5 of the voting shares of the savings institution or savings and loan holding company. These provisions also prohibit, among other things, any director or officer of a savings and loan holding company, or any individual who owns or controls more
 than 25 of the voting shares of such holding company, from acquiring control of any savings institution not a subsidiary of such savings and loan holding company, unless the acquisition is approved by the Federal Reserve Board.

17 

Table of Contents 

The Federal Reserve Board may not approve any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: (i) the
 approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies and (ii) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state, if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such
 acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.

Holding Company Activities. Home Federal Bancorp operates as a unitary savings and loan holding company and is permitted to engage only in the activities permitted for
 financial institution holding companies or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. Multiple savings and loan holding companies are permitted to engage in the following activities: (i) activities permitted for a bank holding company under
 section 4(c) of the Bank Holding Company Act (unless the Federal Reserve Board prohibits or limits such 4(c) activities); (ii) furnishing or performing management services for a subsidiary savings association; (iii) conducting any insurance
 agency or escrow business; (iv) holding, managing, or liquidating assets owned by or acquired from a subsidiary savings association; (v) holding or managing properties used or occupied by a subsidiary savings association; (vi) acting as trustee
 under deeds of trust; or (vii) activities authorized by regulation as of March 5, 1987 to be engaged in by multiple savings and loan holding companies. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, savings and loan holding companies became subject to statutory
 capital requirements. However, in May 2015, amendments to the Small Bank Holding Company SBHC Policy became effective. The amendments made the SBHC Policy applicable to savings and loan holding companies, such as Home Federal Bancorp, and
 increased the asset threshold to qualify to be subject to the provisions of the SBHC Policy from 500 million to 1.0 billion. The 2018 regulatory reform increased the asset threshold to 3.0 billion. Savings and loan holding companies that have
 total assets of 3.0 billion or less are subject to the SBHC Policy and are not required to comply with the regulatory capital requirements set forth in the table below. Such treatment continues until Home Federal Bancorp s total assets exceed
 3.0 billion or the Federal Reserve Board deems it to no longer be a small savings and loan holding company.

While there are no specific restrictions on the payment of dividends or other capital distributions for savings and loan holding companies, federal regulations do prescribe such restrictions on subsidiary savings
 institutions, as described below. Home Federal Bank is required to notify the Federal Reserve Board 30 days before declaring any dividend. In addition, the financial impact of a holding company on its subsidiary institution is a matter that is
 evaluated by the Federal Reserve Board, and the agency has authority to order cessation of activities or divestiture of subsidiaries deemed to pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the institution.

All savings associations subsidiaries of savings and loan holding companies are required to meet a qualified thrift lender, or QTL, test to avoid certain restrictions on their operations. If the subsidiary savings
 institution fails to meet the QTL, as discussed below, then the savings and loan holding company must register with the Federal Reserve Board as a bank holding company, unless the savings institution requalifies as a QTL within one year
 thereafter.

Federal Securities Laws. Home Federal Bancorp registered its common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
 1934. Home Federal Bancorp is subject to the proxy and tender offer rules, insider trading reporting requirements and restrictions, and certain other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a public company, Home Federal Bancorp is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance,

Volcker Rule Regulations

Regulations have been adopted by the federal banking agencies to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. The regulations contain prohibitions and restrictions on the
 ability of financial institutions holding companies and their affiliates to engage in proprietary trading and to hold certain interests in, or to have certain relationships with, various types of investment funds, including hedge funds and
 private equity funds. However, federal regulations exclude from the Volcker Rule restrictions community banks with 10 billion or less in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and liabilities of five percent or less of total
 consolidated assets. Home Federal Bancorp qualifies for the exclusion from the Volcker Rule restrictions.

Regulation of Home Federal Bank

General. Home Federal Bank is subject to the regulation of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as its primary federal regulator, the Federal Deposit Insurance
 Corporation, as the insurer of its deposit accounts, and, to a limited extent, the Federal Reserve Board.

Insurance of Accounts. The deposits of Home Federal Bank are insured up to 250,000 per separately insured deposit ownership right or category by the Deposit Insurance Fund
 DIF of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. As insurer, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by
 insured institutions. It also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
 also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions after giving the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency an opportunity to take such action.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assesses deposit insurance premiums quarterly on each insured institution applied to its deposit base, which is their average consolidated total assets minus its Tier 1
 capital. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment. Total base assessment rates currently range from 3 to 30 basis points subject to certain adjustments.

Extraordinary growth in insured deposits during the first and second quarters of 2020 caused the DIF reserve ratio to decline below the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent as of June 30, 2020. In September 2020, the
 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Board of Directors adopted a Restoration Plan to restore the reserve ratio to at least 1.35 percent within eight years, absent extraordinary circumstances, as required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.
 The Restoration Plan maintained the assessment rate schedules in place at the time and required the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to update its analysis and projections for the deposit insurance fund balance and reserve ratio at least
 semiannually.

In the semiannual update for the Restoration Plan in June 2022, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation projected that the reserve ratio was at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent by
 September 30, 2028, the statutory deadline to restore the reserve ratio. Based on this update, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Board approved an Amended Restoration Plan, and concurrently proposed an increase in initial base deposit
 insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, applicable to all insured depository institutions.

19 

Table of Contents 

In October 2022, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Board finalized the increase with an effective date of January 1, 2023, applicable to the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The revised assessment
 rate schedules are intended to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the DIF reaches the statutory minimum level of 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028. Revised assessment rate schedules will remain in effect unless and until the
 reserve ratio meets or exceeds two percent, absent further action by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Board. A significant increase in insurance premiums or a special assessment levied by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation could
 likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Home Federal Bank. There can be no prediction as to what changes in insurance assessment rates may be made in the future.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including Home Federal Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or
 is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order, or any condition imposed by an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance
 Corporation. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the
 institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Management is aware of no existing
 circumstances which would result in termination of Home Federal Bank s deposit insurance.

Regulatory Capital Regulations

In July of 2013, the respective U.S. federal banking agencies issued final rules implementing Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act capital requirements to be fully-phased in on a global basis on January 1, 2019. The 2013
 regulations establish a tangible common equity capital requirement, increase the minimum requirement for the current Tier 1 risk-weighted asset RWA ratio, phase out certain kinds of intangibles treated as capital and certain types of
 instruments, and change the risk weightings of certain assets used to determine required capital ratios. Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act generally require these capital rules to apply to savings and loan holding companies and their savings
 association subsidiaries. The common equity Tier 1 capital component requires capital of the highest quality predominantly composed of retained earnings and common stock instruments. For community banks, such as Home Federal Bank, the new
 capital rules require a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 and also increased the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio from 4.0 to 6.0 . In addition, in order to make capital distributions and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers
 without restriction, an institution must also maintain greater than 2.5 in common equity attributable to a capital conservation buffer. The rules also increase the risk weights for several categories of assets, including an increase from 100 to
 150 for certain acquisition, development, and construction loans and more than 90-day past due exposures. The capital rules maintain the general structure of the prompt corrective action rules but incorporate the new common equity Tier 1 capital
 requirement and the increase Tier 1 RWA requirement into the prompt corrective action framework.

Effective January 1, 2020, qualifying community banking organizations may elect to comply with a greater than 9 community bank leverage ratio (the CBLR requirement in lieu of the currently applicable requirements
 for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios. The CBLR is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by average total consolidated assets. In order to qualify for the CBLR election, a community bank must (i) have a leverage capital ratio greater
 than 9 percent, (2) have less than 10 billion in average total consolidated assets, (3) not exceed certain levels of off-balance sheet exposure and trading assets plus trading liabilities and (4) not be an advanced approaches banking
 organization. A community bank that meets the above qualifications and elects to utilize the CBLR is considered to have satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the generally applicable capital rules and is also considered to
 be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action rules. As of June 30, 2022, Home Federal Bank has not made the CBLR election.

Unless a community bank qualifies for and elects to comply with the CBLR beginning on January 1, 2020, federally insured savings institutions are required to maintain the minimum levels of regulatory capital
 described below. Current Office of the Comptroller of the Currency capital standards require savings institutions to satisfy a tangible capital requirement, a common equity Tier 1 capital requirement, a leverage capital requirement and a
 risk-based capital requirement. The tangible capital must equal at least 1.5 of adjusted total assets. The common equity Tier 1 capital component generally consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments and must equal at least 4.5 
 of risk-weighted assets. Leverage capital, also known as core capital, must equal at least 3.0 of adjusted total assets for the most highly rated savings associations. An additional cushion of at least 100 basis points is required for all
 other savings associations, which effectively increases their minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio to 4.0 or more. Under the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency s regulation, the most highly-rated banks are those that the Office of the
 Comptroller of the Currency determines are strong associations that are not anticipating or experiencing significant growth and have well-diversified risk, including no undue interest rate risk exposure, excellent asset quality, high liquidity,
 and good earnings. Under the risk-based capital requested, Total capital (a combination of core and supplementary capital) must equal at least 8.0 of risk-weighted assets. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also is authorized to
 impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis.

Table of Contents 

Core capital generally consists of common stockholders equity (including retained earnings). Tangible capital generally equals core capital minus intangible assets, with only a limited exception for purchased
 mortgage servicing rights. Home Federal Bank had no intangible assets at June 30, 2022 . Both core and tangible capital are further reduced by an amount equal to a
 savings institution s debt and equity investments in subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible to national banks (other than subsidiaries engaged in activities undertaken as agent for customers or in mortgage banking activities and
 subsidiary depository institutions or their holding companies). These adjustments do not affect Home Federal Bank s regulatory capital.

In determining compliance with the risk-based capital requirement, a savings institution is allowed to include both core capital and supplementary capital in its total capital, provided that the amount of
 supplementary capital included does not exceed the savings institution s core capital. Supplementary capital generally consists of general allowances for loan losses up to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets together with certain other
 items. In determining the required amount of risk-based capital, total assets, including certain off-balance sheet items, are multiplied by a risk weight based on the risks inherent in the type of assets. The risk weights range from 0 for cash
 and securities issued by the U.S. Government, or unconditionally backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, to 100 for loans (other than qualifying residential loans weighted at 80 and repossessed assets.

Savings institutions must value securities available for sale at amortized cost for regulatory capital purposes. This means that in computing regulatory capital, savings institutions should add back any unrealized
 losses and deduct any unrealized gains, net of income taxes, on debt securities reported as a separate component of capital as defined by generally accepted accounting principles.

At June 30, 2023, Home Federal Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with tangible, common equity Tier 1, core, and risk-based capital ratios of 8.69 , 12.79 , 8.69 and 13.95 , respectively.

Any savings institution that fails any of the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement actions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Such
 actions could include a capital directive, a cease and desist order, civil money penalties, establishment of restrictions on the institution s operations, termination of federal deposit insurance, and the appointment of a conservator or receiver.
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency s capital regulation provides that such actions, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, could require one or more of a variety of corrective actions.

 regulations.

In addition, an institution is critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0 . Under specified circumstances, a federal banking agency may
 reclassify a well-capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that
 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized).

An institution, generally, must file a written capital restoration plan which meets specified requirements within 45 days of the date that the institution receives notice or is deemed to have notice that it is
 undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized. A federal banking agency must provide the institution with written notice of approval or disapproval within 60 days after receiving a capital restoration plan,
 subject to extensions by the agency. An institution which is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guaranty by each company that controls the institution. In addition, undercapitalized institutions
 are subject to various regulatory restrictions, and the appropriate federal banking agency also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions.

At June 30, 2023, Home Federal Bank was deemed a well-capitalized institution for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations and as such is not subject to the above mentioned restrictions.

Capital Distributions. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations govern capital distributions by savings institutions, which include cash dividends, stock
 repurchases, and other transactions charged to the capital account of a savings institution to make capital distributions. A savings institution must file an application for Office of the Comptroller of the Currency approval of the capital
 distribution if either (i) the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the institution s net income for that year to date plus the institution s retained net income for the preceding two years, (ii) the
 institution would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution, (iii) the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement, or Office of the Comptroller of the Currency-imposed condition, or (iv) the
 institution is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings. If an application is not required to be filed, savings institutions must still file a notice with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency at least 30 days before the board
 of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution if either (i) the institution would not be well-capitalized following the distribution; (ii) the proposed distribution would reduce the amount or retire any part of our common or
 preferred stock or retire any part of a debt instrument included in our regulatory capital, or (iii) the savings institution is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, and the proposed capital distribution is not a cash dividend. If a
 savings institution, such as Home Federal Bank, that is the subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company has filed a notice with the Federal Reserve Board for a cash dividend and is not required to file an application or notice with the
 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for any of the reasons described above, then the savings institution is only required to provide an informational copy to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the notice filed with the Federal
 Reserve Board at the same time that it is filed with the Federal Reserve Board.

An institution that either before or after a proposed capital distribution fails to meet its then applicable minimum capital requirement or that has been notified that it needs more than normal supervision may not
 make any capital distributions without the prior written approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may prohibit a proposed capital distribution, which would otherwise be
 permitted by Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations, if the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.

Under federal rules, an insured depository institution may not pay any dividend, if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized, or if it is already undercapitalized. In addition, federal regulators have the
 authority to restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends for safety and soundness reasons. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also prohibits an insured depository institution from paying dividends on its capital stock or interest on its
 capital notes or debentures (if such interest is required to be paid only out of net profits) or distributing any of its capital assets while it remains in default in the payment of any assessment due the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 Home Federal Bank is currently not in default in any assessment payment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Qualified Thrift Lender Test. All savings institution subsidiaries of savings and loan holding companies are required to meet a qualified thrift lender, or QTL, test to avoid
 certain restrictions on their operations. A savings institution can comply with the QTL test by either qualifying as a domestic building and loan association as defined in the Internal Revenue Code or meeting the Office of the Comptroller of the
 Currency QTL test. Currently, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency QTL test requires that 65 of an institution s portfolio assets (as defined) consist of certain housing and consumer-related assets on a monthly average basis in nine
 out of every 12 months. To be a qualified thrift lender under the IRS test, the savings institution must meet a business operations test and a 60 percent assets test, each defined in the Internal Revenue Code.

If a savings association fails to remain a QTL, it is immediately prohibited from the following:

Making any new investments or engaging in any new activity not allowed for both a national bank and a savings association;

Establishing any new branch office unless allowable for a national bank; and

Paying dividends unless allowable for a national bank and necessary to meet the obligations of its holding company.

Any company that controls a savings institution that is not a qualified thrift lender must register as a bank holding company within one year of the savings institution s failure to meet the QTL test. Three years
 from the date a savings association should have become or ceases to be a QTL, the institution must dispose of any investment or not engage in any activity unless the investment or activity is allowed for both a national bank and a savings
 association. A savings institution not in compliance with the QTL test is also subject to an enforcement action for violation of the Home Owners Loan Act, as amended.

At June 30, 2023, Home Federal Bank believes that it meets the requirements of the QTL test.

Community Reinvestment Act. Home Federal Bank is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 CRA ), which require the appropriate federal bank
 regulatory agency to assess a bank s performance under the CRA in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by Home Federal Bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency s assessment of Home Federal Bank s
 record is made available to the public. Further, a bank s CRA performance must be considered in connection with a bank s application, to among other things, establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an existing office or
 merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. An unsatisfactory rating may be the basis for denial of certain applications. Home Federal Bank received a satisfactory 
 rating during its most recent CRA examination.

On May 5, 2022, the federal bank regulatory agencies overhauled the CRA and jointly issued a proposal to strengthen and modernize regulations implementing the CRA. The proposed regulations included major changes from
 the current regulation and will be effective on the first day of the first calendar quarter that begins at least 60 days after the publication date of the final rules. The new rules as proposed are intended to, (1) provide expanded access to
 credit, investment, and basic banking services in low- and moderate-income communities, (2) address changes in the banking industry, including internet and mobile banking, (3) yield greater clarity, consistency, and transparency, (4) tailor CRA
 evaluations and data collection to bank size and type and (4) maintain a unified approach amongst the regulating agencies.

Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates. Transactions between a savings association and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as
 made applicable to savings associations by Section 11 of the Home Owners Loan Act. An affiliate of a savings association is any company or entity which controls the savings association or that is controlled by a company that controls the savings
 association. In a holding company context, the holding company of a savings association (such as Home Federal Bancorp) and any companies which are controlled by such holding company are affiliates of the savings association. Generally, Section
 23A limits the extent to which the savings association or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10 of such association s capital stock and surplus and contains an aggregate limit on
 all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20 of such capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to covered transactions as well as certain other transactions and requires that all transactions be on terms
 substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the savings association as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term covered transaction includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from, and issuance of a guarantee to an
 affiliate and similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a savings association to an affiliate. In addition to the restrictions imposed by Sections 23A and 23B, a savings
 association is prohibited from (i) making a loan or other extension of credit to an affiliate, except for any affiliate which engages only in certain activities which are permissible for bank holding companies, or (ii) purchasing or investing in
 any stocks, bonds, debentures, notes, or similar obligations of any affiliate, except for affiliates which are subsidiaries of the savings association.

In addition, Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act as made applicable to savings associations by Section 11 of the Home Owners Loan Act place restrictions on loans to executive officers, directors, and
 principal shareholders of the savings association and its affiliates. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, an executive officer, and to a greater than 10 shareholder of a savings association, and certain affiliated interests of either, may
 not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, the savings association s loans to one borrower limit (generally equal to 15 of the association s unimpaired capital and surplus). Section 22(h) also
 requires that loans to directors, executive officers, and principal shareholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation
 program that (i) is widely available to employees of the savings association and (ii) does not give preference to any director, executive officer, or principal shareholder, or certain affiliated interests of either, over other employees of the
 savings association. Section 22(h) also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a savings association to all insiders cannot exceed the savings association s unimpaired capital
 and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. Home Federal Bank currently is subject to Section 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act and at June 30, 2023, was in compliance with the
 above restrictions.

Incentive Compensation. Guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies pursuant to the FDIA prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe
 compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal stockholder.

In June 2010, the federal banking agencies issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies (the Incentive Compensation Guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of
 banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Incentive Compensation Guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk
 profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the
 organization s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the
 organization s board of directors. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The
 Incentive Compensation Guidance provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization s
 safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.

Regulation of Residential Mortgage Loan Originators. Under the final rule adopted by the federal bank regulatory authorities pursuant to the Secure and Fair Enforcement for
 Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, residential mortgage loan originators employed by financial institutions, such as Home Federal Bank, must register with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, obtain a unique identifier from the
 registry, and maintain their registration. Any residential mortgage loan originator who fails to satisfy these requirements will not be permitted to originate residential mortgage loans.

Anti-Money Laundering. All financial institutions, including savings associations, are subject to federal laws that are designed to prevent the use of the U.S. financial
 system to fund terrorist activities. Financial institutions operating in the United States must develop anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies, and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering.
 Such compliance programs are intended to supplement compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations. Home Federal Bank has established policies
 and procedures to ensure compliance with these provisions.

Privacy Standards and Cybersecurity. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 modernized the financial services industry by establishing a
 comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms and other financial service providers. Federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have adopted guidelines for establishing information
 security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of the board of directors. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to
 information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial services. These regulations require Home Federal Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of its information sharing practices and
 informing consumers of their rights to opt out of certain practices. In addition, Louisiana State and other federal and state cybersecurity and data privacy laws and regulations may expose Home Federal Bank to risk and result in certain risk
 management costs. In addition, on November 18, 2021, the federal banking agencies announced the adoption of a final rule providing for new notification requirements for banking organizations and their service providers for significant
 cybersecurity incidents. Specifically, the new rule requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator as soon as possible, and no later than 36 hours after, the banking organization determines that a computer-security
 incident rising to the level of a notification incident has occurred. Notification is required for incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the viability of a banking organization s operations, its
 ability to deliver banking products and services, or the stability of the financial sector. Service providers are required under the rule to notify affected banking organization customers as soon as possible when the provider determines that it
 has experienced a computer-security incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the banking organization s customers for four or more hours. Compliance with the new rule was required by May 1, 2022.
 Non-compliance with federal or similar state privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations could lead to substantial regulatory imposed fines and penalties, damages from private causes of action and/or reputational harm.

Federal Home Loan Bank System. Home Federal Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, which is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks that administer a
 home financing credit function primarily for its members. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. The Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas is funded primarily from proceeds derived
 from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. It makes loans to members i.e. , advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors
 of the Federal Home Loan Bank. At June 30, 2023, Home Federal Bank had no advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank and 212.2 million available on its credit line with the Federal Home Loan Bank.

As a member, Home Federal Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank
 of Dallas. At June 30, 2023, Home Federal Bank had 1.3 million in Federal Home
 Loan Bank stock, which was in compliance with the applicable requirement. 

The Federal Home Loan Banks are required to provide funds for the resolution of troubled savings institutions and to contribute to affordable housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances
 targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have adversely affected the level of Federal Home Loan Bank dividends paid in the past and could do so in the future. These contributions also
 could have an adverse effect on the value of Federal Home Loan Bank stock in the future.

Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and Super NOW
 checking accounts) and non-personal time deposits. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective May 26, 2020 to support lending to households and businesses The required
 reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or an account at a Federal Reserve Bank. At June 30, 2023, Home Federal Bank was not required to maintain any reserve balances.

TAXATION

Federal Taxation

General. Home Federal Bancorp and Home Federal Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations with some exceptions listed below.
 The following discussion of federal and state income taxation is only intended to summarize certain pertinent income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the applicable tax rules. Home Federal Bank s tax returns have not been
 audited during the past five years.

Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Home Federal Bank reports income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and used a June 30 tax year in 2023
 for filing its federal income tax return.

Bad Debt Reserves. The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves by savings associations,
 effective for taxable years beginning after 1995. Prior to that time, Home Federal Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted
 in arriving at taxable income. In addition, federal legislation required the recapture over a six year period of the excess of tax bad debt reserves at December 31, 1995 over those established as of December 31, 1987.

Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into
 taxable income if Home Federal Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. New federal legislation eliminated these savings association related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 reserves remain subject to
 recapture should Home Federal Bank make certain non-dividend distributions or cease to maintain a bank charter.

At June 30, 2023, the total federal pre-1988 reserve was approximately 3.3 million. The reserve reflects the cumulative effects of federal tax deductions by Home Federal Bank for which no federal income tax
 provisions have been made.

Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. Home Federal Bancorp may exclude from its income 100 of dividends received from Home Federal Bank as a member of the same affiliated
 group of corporations. The corporate dividends received deduction is 65 in the case of dividends received from corporations which a corporate recipient owns less than 80 but at least 20 of the distribution corporation. Corporations which own
 less than 20 of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct only 50 of dividends received.

State and Local Taxation

Home Federal Bancorp is subject to the Louisiana Corporation Income Tax based on our Louisiana taxable income. The Corporation Income Tax applies at graduated rates from 4 upon the first 25,000 of Louisiana taxable
 income to 8 on all Louisiana taxable income in excess of 200,000. For these purposes, Louisiana taxable income means net income which is earned by us within or derived from sources within the State of Louisiana, after adjustments permitted
 under Louisiana law, including a federal income tax deduction. In addition, Home Federal Bank is subject to the Louisiana Shares Tax which is imposed on the assessed value of a company s stock. The formula for deriving the assessed value is to
 calculate 15 of the sum of:

(a) 

20 of our capitalized earnings, plus

(b) 

80 of our taxable stockholders equity, minus

(c) 

50 of our real and personal property assessment.

Various items may also be subtracted in calculating a company s capitalized earnings.

Item 6. [Reserved] 

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

General

Our profitability depends primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividend income on interest-earning assets, principally loans, investment securities, and interest-earning
 deposits in other institutions, and interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. Net interest income is dependent upon the level of interest rates and the extent to which such rates are
 changing. Our profitability also depends, to a lesser extent, on non-interest income, provision for loan losses, non-interest expenses, and federal income taxes. Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. of Louisiana had net income of 5.7 million in fiscal
 2023 compared to net income of 4.9 million in fiscal 2022.

Our business consists primarily of originating single-family real estate loans secured by property in our market area and to a lesser extent, commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, and real estate
 secured lines of credit which typically have higher rates and shorter terms than single-family loans. Although our loans are primarily funded by the acquisition of deposits and it is our policy to require commercial customers to have a deposit
 relationship with us, which primarily consists of NOW accounts or non-interest checking accounts. Due to the continued low interest rate environment, we have sold a substantial amount of our fixed rate single-family residential loan originations
 in recent periods. Because of an increase in our average rate on our interest-bearing assets, partially offset by an increase in our rate on total interest bearing liabilities, our net interest margin increased from 3.27 to 3.73 during fiscal
 2023 compared to 2022, and our net interest income increased 4.2 million to 21.6 million for fiscal 2023 as compared to 17.4 million for fiscal 2022. We expect to continue to emphasize commercial lending in the future in order to improve the
 yield on our portfolio.

Home Federal Bancorp s operations and profitability are subject to changes in interest rates, applicable statutes and regulations, and general economic conditions, as well as other factors beyond our control.

Business Strategy

Our business strategy is focused on operating a growing and profitable community-oriented financial institution. Our current business strategy includes:

Continuing to Grow and Diversify Our Loan Portfolio . We intend to grow and continue to diversify our loan portfolio by, among other things, emphasizing the
 origination of commercial real estate and business loans. At June 30, 2023, our commercial real estate loans amounted to 148.4 million, or 30.0 of the total loan portfolio. Our commercial business loans amounted to 55.4 million, or
 11.2 of the total loan portfolio. Commercial real estate, commercial business, construction and development, and consumer loans all typically have higher yields and are more interest sensitive than long-term single-family residential
 mortgage loans.

Diversify Our Products and Services . We intend to continue to emphasize our commercial business products to provide a full-service banking relationship to our
 commercial customers. We have introduced mobile and Internet banking and remote deposit capture, to better serve our commercial clients. Additionally, we have developed new deposit products focused on expanding our deposit base to new
 types of customers.

Managing Our Expenses . We have incurred significant additional expenses related to personnel and infrastructure in recent periods as we implemented our business strategy. The 1.5
 million increase in non-interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to the year ended June 30, 2022, is primarily attributable to increases of 875,000 in professional fees which were primarily due to FNBB acquisition
 costs. Our efficiency ratio, non-interest expense divided by ne t
 interest income plus non-interest income, for 2023 w as 67.71 c ompared to 69.59 for fiscal 2022. 

Enhancing Core Earnings . We expect to continue to emphasize commercial real estate and business loans, which generally bear interest rates higher than residential
 real estate loans, and sell a substantial part of our fixed rate residential mortgage loan originations.

Expanding Our Franchise in our Market Area and Contiguous Communities . We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to expand our market area by opening additional de novo banking offices and possibly through acquisitions of other financial institutions and banking related businesses. We expect to focus on contiguous areas to our current locations in Caddo,
 Bossier and Webster Parishes. In February 2023, we completed our acquisition of Northwest Bancshares Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, First National Bank of Benton, with one full-service branch location in Benton, Louisiana.

Maintain Our Asset Quality . At June 30, 2023, our non-performing assets totaled 1.6 million, or 0.26 of total assets. We had 368,000 in other real estate owned at
 June 30, 2023. We intend to continue to stress maintaining high asset quality, even as we continue to grow our institution and diversify our loan portfolio.

Cross-Selling Products and Services and Emphasizing Local Decision Making . We have promoted cross-selling products and services in our branch offices and emphasized
 our local decision making and streamlined loan approval process.

Critical Accounting Policies

In reviewing and understanding financial information for Home Federal Bancorp, you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
 These policies are described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document. Our accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United
 States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements require certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable based upon the information
 available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented. The following accounting
 policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may
 be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods.

29 

Table of Contents 

Allowance for Loan Losses. We have identified the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses as a critical accounting policy and a critical accounting estimate where amounts
 are sensitive to material variation. The allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate for probable losses that are inherent in our loan portfolio but which have not yet been realized as of the date of our consolidated balance sheet.
 It is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries are added to
 the allowance. The allowance is an amount that management believes will cover known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans. The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in
 the types and amount of loans in the loan portfolio, historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, estimated losses relating to specifically
 identified loans, and current economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including, among others, exposure at default, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impacted loans,
 value of collateral, estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios, and general amounts for historical loss experience. All of these estimates may be susceptible to significant changes as more information becomes available.

While management uses the best information available to make loan loss allowance evaluations, adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions or changes in accounting
 guidance. Historically, our estimates of the allowance for loan loss have not required significant adjustments from management s initial estimates. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as an integral part of their
 examination processes periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available
 to them at the time of their examinations. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from management s estimates, additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.

The allowance for loan losses is comprised of (i) specific reserves determined in accordance with current authoritative accounting guidance based on probable specific losses (ii) general reserve determined in
 accordance with current authoritative accounting guidance that consider historical loss experience, and (iii) qualitative reserves determined in accordance with current authoritative accounting guidance based upon qualitive factors, which
 include: 1) changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; 2) changes in national and local economic trends and conditions; 3) changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio; 4) changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending
 management and staff; 5) changes in the volume and loss severity of past due loans, the volume of non-accrual loans, and the volume and loss severity of adversely classified or graded loans; 6) changes in the quality of the Company s loan review
 system; 7) changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans; 8) the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations.

Business Combinations

Acquisition Accounting . Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires the Company as the acquirer to
 recognize the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, as well as recognize goodwill. If the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets
 acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in an acquisition, goodwill is recognized. The Company records provisional amounts of fair value at the time of acquisition. The provisional fair values are subject to modification
 for up to one year after the acquisition.

30 

Table of Contents 

Acquired Loans. Purchased loans acquired are recorded at their fair value. Discounts are included in the determination of the fair value. As such, an allowance for loan loss
 is not recorded at the acquisition date. Acquired loans are evaluated at acquisition and classified as either purchased credit impaired or purchased performing loans. Purchased credit impaired loans reflect credit deterioration since origination
 and as such at the date of acquisition the Company will not be able to collect all contractually required payments. The Company accounts for acquired impaired loans in accordance with ASC 310-30 , Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality ASC 310-30 ). Purchased credit impaired loans are accounted for individually. The Company estimates the amount and timing of undiscounted
 expected cash flows for each loan. The excess of the cash flows expected to be collected over a loan s carrying value is considered to be the accretable yield, which is recognized as interest income over the estimated life of the loan. The excess
 of the undiscounted contractual balances due over the cash flows expected to be collected is considered to be the nonaccretable difference. Over the life of the loan, expected cash flows continue to be estimated. If the expected cash flows
 decrease, a provision for loan loss is recorded.

If the expected cash flows increase, it is recognized as part of future income. Purchased performing loans are accounted for under ASC 310-20, Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs ASC 310-20 ), with the related discount or premium being recognized as an adjustment to yield over the life of the loan.

Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is
 evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.

Core Deposit Intangible . Core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in business
 combinations. The Company s policy is to amortize these intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life, which the estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness. Core deposit intangibles are tested for
 impairment if events and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows.

Changes in Financial Condition

At June 30, 2023, the Company reported total assets of 660.9 million, an increase of 70.4 million, or 11.9 , compared to total assets of 590.5 million at June 30, 2022. The increase in assets was comprised
 primarily of increases in loans receivable, net of 101.6 million, or 26.2 , from 387.9 million at June 30, 2022 to 489.5 million at June 30, 2023, investment securities of 5.9 million, or 5.5 , from 108.0 million at June 30, 2022 to 114.0
 million at June 30, 2023, goodwill of 3.0 million from none at June 30, 2022 to 3.0 million at June 30, 2023, core deposit intangible of 1.5 million from none at June 30, 2022 to 1.5 million at June 30, 2023, accrued interest receivable of
 665,000, or 59.2 , from 1.1 million at June 30, 2022 to 1.8 million at June 30, 2023, real estate owned of 368,000 from none at June 30, 2022 to 368,000 at June 30, 2023, premises and equipment of 313,000, or 1.9 , from 16.2 million at
 June 30, 2022 to 16.6 million at June 30, 2023, deferred tax assets of 170,000, or 14.9 , from 1.1 million at June 30, 2022 to 1.3 million at June 30, 2023, bank owned life insurance Of 103,000, or 1.6 , from 6.6 million at June 30,2022 to
 6.7 million at June 30,2023, and other assets of 34,000, or 2.5 , from 1.3 million at June 30,2022 to 1.4 million at June 30,2023.. These increases were partially offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents of 39.3 million, or 61.4 ,
 from 64.1 million at June 30, 2022 to 24.8 million at June 30, 2023, loans held-for-sale of 4.0 million, or 99.7 , from 4.0 million at June 30, 2022 to 4,000 at June 30, 2023.

Loans receivable, net increased 101.6 million, or 26.2 , from 387.9 million at June 30, 2022 to 489.5 million at June 30, 2023. The increase in loans receivable, net was attributable primarily to increases related
 to the acquisition of 54.9 million in loans from First National Bank of Benton. With rising interest rates, management is reluctant to invest in long-term, fixed rate mortgage loans for the portfolio and instead sells the majority of the
 long-term, fixed rate mortgage loan production.

In recent periods we diversified the loan products we offer and increased our efforts to originate higher yielding commercial real estate loans and lines of credit and commercial business loans which were deemed
 attractive due to their generally higher yields and shorter anticipated lives compared to single-family residential mortgage loans. As of June 30, 2023, Home Federal Bank had 148.4 million of commercial real estate loans, 30.0 of the total loan
 portfolio, and 55.4 million of commercial business loans, 11.2 of the total loan portfolio. Although commercial loans are generally considered to have greater credit risk than other certain types of loans, we attempt to mitigate such risk by
 originating such loans in our market area to known borrowers.

Securities available-for-sale increased 11.5 million, or 40.8 , from 28.1 million at June 30, 2022 to 39.6 million at June
 30, 2023. This increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of FNBB securities with balances of 10.0 million at June 30, 2023, purchases of 7.4 million in securities, partially offset by principal repayments of 4.7 million and a decrease
 in market values of securities of 1.3 million.

Securities held-to-maturity decreased 5.5 million, from 79.9 million at June 30, 2022 to 74.4 million at June 30, 2023. 
 This decrease was primarily due to principal repayments of 6.5 million offset by purchases of 1.0 million in FHLB stock.

Cash and cash equivalents decreased 39.3 million, or 61.4 , from 64.1 million at June 30, 2022 to 24.8 million at June 30, 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the funding of
 additional loan growth and purchases of securities with excess liquidity.

Total liabilities increased 72.2 million, or 13.4 , from 538.1 million at June 30, 2022 to 610.4 million at June 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in total deposits of 65.4 million (deposits acquired in the
 acquisition of First National Bank of Benton totaled 77.4 million), or 12.3 , to 597.4 million at June 30, 2023 compared to 532.0 million at June 30, 2022, other borrowings of 6.2 million, or 263.8 , to 8.6 million at June 30, 2023 compared
 to 2.4 million at June 30, 2022, other accrued expenses and liabilities of 1.3 million, or 49.9 , to 3.9 million at June 30, 2023 compared to 2.6 million at June 30, 2022, and an increase in advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance of
 200,000, or 56.5 , to 554,000 at June 30,2023 compared to 354,000 at June 30, 2022 partially offset by a decrease in advances from FHLB of 832,000, or 100.0 , to none at June 30,2023 compared to 832,000 at June 30, 2022. The increase in
 deposits was primarily due to a 110.1 million, or 137.1 , increase in certificates of deposit from 80.3 million at June 30, 2022 to 190.4 million at June 30, 2023, a 15.6 million, or 15.8 , increase in money market deposits from 98.6 million
 at June 30, 2022 to 114.2 million at June 30, 2023,and a 6.4 million, or 10.8 , increase in NOW accounts from 59.0 million at June 30, 2022 to 65.3 million at June 30, 2023, partially offset by a decrease of 51.1 million, or 38.4 , in
 savings deposits from 133.0 million at June 30, 2022 to 81.9 million at June 30, 2023, and a decrease of 15.6 million, or 9.7 , in non-interest deposits from 161.4 million at June 30, 2022 to 145.6 million at June 30, 2023. The Company had
 3.0 million in brokered deposits at June 30, 2023 compared to 6.0 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank was primarily due to principal paydowns on amortizing advances.

Stockholders equity decreased 1.8 million, or 3.4 , to 50.5 million at June 30, 2023 from 52.3 million at June 30, 2022. The primary reasons for the changes in stockholders equity from June 30, 2022 were the
 repurchase of Company stock of 6.0 million, dividends paid totaling 1.5 million, and a decrease in the Company s accumulated other comprehensive income of 1.0 million, partially offset by net income of 5.7 million, the vesting of restricted
 stock awards, stock options, and the release of employee stock ownership plan shares totaling 620,000, and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options of 328,000.

Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest-related assets and liabilities have
 affected Home Federal Bancorp s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in
 volume (change in volume multiplied by prior year rate), (ii) changes in rate (change in rate multiplied by current year volume), and (iii) total change in rate and volume. The combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated
 proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022

General. The increase in net income for the year ended June 30, 2023 resulted primarily from a 4.2 million, or 24.2 , increase in net interest income, and a decrease of 61,000, or 5.4 , in provision for
 income taxes, partially offset by an increase of 1.5 million, or 10.5 , in non-interest expense, a decrease of 1.4 million, or 39.6 , in non-interest income, and an increase of 532,000, or 158.3 in provision for loan losses. The increase in
 the provision for loan losses is mainly due to growth in the overall loan portfolio. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to a 7.4 million, or 38.5 , increase in total interest income, partially offset by a 3.2 million, or
 170.6 , increase in total interest expense. The Company s average interest rate spread was 3.37 for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to 3.11 for the year ended June 30, 2022. The Company s net interest margin was 3.73 for the year ended
 June 30, 2023 compared to 3.27 for the year ended June 30, 2022.

Net Interest Income. Net interest income amounted to 21.6 million for fiscal year 2023, an increase of 4.2 million, or 24.2 , compared to 17.4 million for fiscal year 2022.
 The increase was due primarily to an increase of 7.4 million in total interest income, partially offset by a 3.2 million increase in total interest expense.

The average interest rate spread increased from 3.11 for fiscal 2022 to 3.37 for fiscal 2023, while the average balance of interest-earning assets increased from 531.2 million to 577.8 million during the same
 periods. The percentage of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 141.05 for fiscal 2023 compared to 143.32 for fiscal 2022. The average rate paid on certificates of deposit increased from 1.37 for
 fiscal 2022 to 2.34 for fiscal 2023. Net interest margin increased to 3.73 for fiscal 2023 compared to 3.27 for fiscal 2022.

Interest income increased 7.4 million, or 38.5 , to 26.6 million for fiscal 2023 compared to 19.2 million for fiscal 2022, primarily due to an increase in interest income from loans of 6.0 million, an increase in
 interest income on other earning assets of 750,000 and an increase of 696,000 in interest income from investment and mortgage-backed securities. The increase in the average balance of loans receivable was primarily due to new loans originated by
 our commercial lending division and loans acquired in the acquisition of First National Bank of Benton. The average yield of the loan portfolio increased by 57 basis points during fiscal 2023 mainly due to a higher interest rate environment.

Interest expense increased 3.2 million, or 170.6 , to 5.1 million for fiscal 2023 compared to 1.9 million for fiscal 2022, primarily as a result of decreases in the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits.

Provision for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings as losses are estimated to have occurred in our
 loan portfolio. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.

The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume
 of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of the underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. The evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are
 susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.

A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information or events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual
 terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is impaired, the measurement of such impairment is based upon the fair value of the collateral of the loan. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the recorded investment in the loan, we will
 recognize the impairment by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge against earnings.

An allowance is also established for uncollectible interest on loans classified as substandard. The allowance is established by a charge to interest income equal to all interest previously accrued, and income is
 subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received. When, in management s judgment, the borrower s ability to make interest and principal payments is back to normal, the loan is returned to accrual status.

A provision of 868,000 was made to the allowance during fiscal 2023, compared to a provision of
 336,000 in fiscal 2022. At June 30, 2023, the Company had 1. 6 million
 of non-performing assets (defined as non-accruing loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past due, and other real estate owned) compared to 2.2 million of non-performing assets at June 30, 2022, consisting of seven single family residential
 loans two non-real estate commercial loans, one consumer loan, and two single-family resi d ences at June 30, 2023, compared to seven single-family residential loans at June
 30, 2022. The decrease in non-performing assets from 2.2 million at June 30, 2022 to 1.7 million at June 30, 2023 was primarily due to improved loan credit quality. At June 30, 2023, the Company had ten single family residential loans,
 three commercial non-real-estate loans, two commercial real estate loans, and three home equity line-of-credit loans classified as substandard compared to five single family residential loans and two commercial real estate loans classified
 as substandard at June 30, 2022. There were no loans classified as doubtful at June 30, 2023 or 2022.

Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income amounted to 2.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.4 million, or 39.6 , compared to non-interest income of
 3.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. The 1.4 million decrease in non-interest income for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a decrease of 1.5 million in gain on sale of loans, a
 232,000 decrease in other non-interest income, and a 10,000 decrease in income from bank owned life insurance, partially offset by an increase of 329,000 in service charges on deposit accounts, and a 52,000 decrease in loss on sale of fixed
 assets and real estate owned . The decrease in gain on sale of loans for the year ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in refinance activity causing a decrease in mortgage loan originations. The Company sells most of its long-term
 fixed rate residential mortgage loan originations primarily in order to manage interest rate risk.

Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased 1.5 million, or 10.5 , in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year period. The 1.5 million increase in non-interest
 expense for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to the prior year period, is primarily attributable to increases of 875,000 in professional fees which were primarily due to FNBB acquisition costs, 267,000 in occupancy and equipment expense,
 174,000 in amortization of core deposit intangible expense, 143,000 in deposit insurance premium expense, 69,000 in compensation and benefits expense, 22,000 in data processing expense, and 11,000 in advertising expense, partially offset by
 decreases of 22,000 in loan and collection expense, 14,000 in audit and examination fees, 5,000 in other non-interest income, and 4,000 in franchise and bank shares tax expense.

Provision for Income Tax Expense. The provision for
 income taxes amounted to 1.1 million for both the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Our effective tax rate was 15.7 for fiscal 2023 and 18.8 for fiscal 2022 . 

Exposure to Changes in Interest Rates

Our ability to maintain net interest income depends upon our ability to earn a higher yield on interest-earning assets than the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings. Our interest-earning assets consist primarily
 of securities available-for-sale and long-term residential and commercial mortgage loans, which have fixed rates of interest. Consequently, our ability to maintain a positive spread between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on
 deposits and borrowings can be adversely affected when market rates of interest rise.

Although long-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans made up a significant portion of our interest-earning assets at June 30, 2023, we sold a substantial amount of our one-to-four family residential loans we originated and
 maintained a significant portfolio of available-for-sale securities during the past few years in order to better position the Company for a rising interest rate environment in the long term. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, securities
 available-for-sale amounted to 39.6 million and 28.1 million, respectively, or 6.04 and 4.8 , respectively, of total assets at such dates.

Quantitative Analysis. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency provides a quarterly report on the potential impact of interest rate changes upon the market value of
 portfolio equity. Management reviews the quarterly reports from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which show the impact of changing interest rates on net portfolio value. Net portfolio value is the difference between incoming and
 outgoing discounted cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts.

Net Portfolio Value. Our interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model which internally generates estimates of the change in our net
 portfolio value NPV over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The NPV ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the NPV in
 that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The following table sets forth our NPV as of June 30, 2023:

Qualitative Analysis. Our ability to maintain a positive spread between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings is affected by changes
 in interest rates. Our fixed-rate loans generally are profitable, if interest rates are stable or declining since these loans have yields that exceed our cost of funds. If interest rates increase, however, we would have to pay more on our
 deposits and new borrowings, which would adversely affect our interest rate spread. In order to counter the potential effects of dramatic increases in market rates of interest, we have underwritten our mortgage loans to allow for their sale in
 the secondary market. Total loan originations amounted to 244.0 million for fiscal 2023 and 339.6 million for fiscal 2022, while loans sold amounted to 24.9 million and 87.2 million during the same respective periods. We have invested excess
 funds from loan payments and prepayments and loan sales in investment securities classified as available-for-sale. As a result, Home Federal Bancorp is not as susceptible to rising interest rates as it would be if its interest-earning assets were
 primarily comprised of long-term fixed rate mortgage loans. With respect to its floating or adjustable rate loans, Home Federal Bancorp writes interest rate floors and caps into such loan documents. Interest rate floors limit our interest rate
 risk by limiting potential decreases in the interest yield on an adjustable rate loan to a certain level. As a result, we receive a minimum yield even if rates decline farther, and the interest rate on the particular loan would otherwise adjust
 to a lower amount. Conversely, interest rate ceilings limit the amount by which the yield on an adjustable rate loan may increase to no more than six percentage points over the rate at the time of origination. Finally, we intend to place a
 greater emphasis on shorter-term consumer loans and commercial business loans in the future.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Home Federal Bancorp maintains levels of liquid assets deemed adequate by management. Our liquidity ratio averaged 21.42 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows,
 repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity, as appropriate, to meet asset and liability management objectives.

Our primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, loan sales and earnings, and funds
 provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic
 conditions, and competition. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning accounts and other assets, which provide liquidity to meet
 lending requirements. Our deposit accounts with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas amounted to 5.0 million and 11.9 million at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

A significant portion of our liquidity consists of securities classified as
 available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents. Our primary sources of cash are net income, principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities, and increases in deposit accounts. If we require funds beyond our ability to
 generate them internally, we have borrowing agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, which provide an additional source of funds. At June 30, 2023, we had no advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas and had 212.2
 million in additional borrowing capacity. Additionally, at June 30, 2023, Home Federal Bank was a party to a Master Purchase Agreement with First National Bankers Bank, whereby Home Federal Bank may purchase Federal Funds from
 First National Bankers Bank in an amount not to exceed 20.4 million. There were no amounts purchased under this agreement as of June 30, 2023. In addition, Home Federal Bancorp had available an 10.0 million line of credit agreement at June 30, 2023 with First National Bankers Bank. At June 30, 2023 there was an 8.6 million balance in the credit line.

At June 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding loan commitments of 53.4 million to originate loans and commitments under unused lines of credit of 15.0 million. At June 30, 2023, certificates of deposit scheduled to
 mature in one year or less totaled 168.2 million, or 88.3 of total certificates of deposit. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that
 this will be the case. In addition, the cost of such deposits could be significantly higher upon renewal in a rising interest rate environment. We intend to utilize our high levels of liquidity to fund our lending activities. If additional funds

At June 30, 2023, Home Federal Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements with tangible equity, common equity Tier 1, core, and total risk-based capital ratios of 8.69 , 12.79 , 8.69 , and 13.95 , respectively.

In the first quarter of 2023, the Company will transition to CECL from the current incurred loss method and recognized a one-time, after-tax cumulative effect adjustment. The Company has been evaluating the impact.
 At this time, the Company estimates the allowance for credit losses will increase between 4 to 9 . The amount determined from adoption will be recognized as a cumulative effective to the July 1, 2023 retained earnings. Regulations of the
 federal banking agencies provide an optional CECL transition provision that allows a banking organization that experiences a reduction in retained earnings as of its CECL adoption date to elect to phase in the regulatory capital impact of that
 reduction over a three-year period. Under the regulations, the Company is required to begin the three-year transition in the first fiscal year it has adopted CECL, which for The Company is fiscal year 2024. As a result, the regulatory capital
 impact of The Company adoption of CECL is being phased in from July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2026.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by Securities and Exchange Commission rules, and have not had any such arrangements during the two years ended June 30, 2023. See Notes 9 and 14 to the
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices

The consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein regarding Home Federal Bancorp have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
 America, which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies,
 virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on Home Federal Bancorp s performance than does the effect of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily
 move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the regulations thereunder). Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but
 instead represent only the beliefs, expectations or opinions of Home Federal Bancorp and its management regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of
 such words as: believe , expect , anticipate , intend , plan , estimate , or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional terms such as will , would , should , could , may , likely , probably , or possibly. Forward-looking
 statements include, but are not limited to, financial projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions; statements regarding plans, objectives and expectations with respect to future operations, products and services; and statements
 regarding future performance. Such statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumption, many of which are difficult to predict and generally are beyond the control of Home Federal Bancorp and its management, that could cause
 actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other
 expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: (1) economic and competitive conditions which could affect the volume of loan originations, deposit flows and real estate values; (2) the levels of non-interest income and expense and the
 amount of loan losses; (3) competitive pressure among depository institutions increasing significantly; (4) changes in the interest rate environment causing reduced interest margins; (5) general economic conditions, either nationally or in the
 markets in which Home Federal Bancorp is or will be doing business, being less favorable than expected (6) political and social unrest including acts of war or terrorism; or (7) legislation or changes in regulatory requirements adversely
 affecting the business in which Home Federal Bancorp will be engaged. Home Federal Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which such statements
 were made.

Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. of Louisiana

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. of Louisiana (the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 and the
 related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2023 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
 statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
 the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial
 statements based on our audits.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with
 respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
 assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
 of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we
 express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
 performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
 significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required
 to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit
 matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or
 disclosures to which they relate.

Allowance for Loan Losses Qualitative Factors 

As described in Note 1 and Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company s allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred
 through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. The allowance for loan losses was 5.173 million at June 30, 2023, which is comprised of (i) specific reserves determined in accordance with current authoritative accounting guidance based on
 probable losses on specific loans (ii) general reserves determined in accordance with current authoritative accounting guidance that consider historical loss experience, and (iii) qualitative reserves. The qualitative reserve is based upon general
 economic conditions as well as other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company and requires management to make judgments regarding the impact of qualitative factors on probable inherent losses. 

41 

Table of Contents 

We identified the allowance for loan losses as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for that determination included the high degree of
 judgment and subjectivity relating to management s identification and measurement of the qualitative factors. This required a high degree of auditor effort and significant auditor judgment in evaluating the estimated allowance for loan losses.

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:

We obtained an understanding of the Company s process for establishing the allowance for loan losses, including the identification, basis for development and
 related adjustments of the qualitative factor components of the allowance for loan losses.

We performed substantive testing over management s qualitative factors by evaluating the relevancy and reliability of the underlying data
 used to derive the qualitative factors, including comparison to internal, external and/or peer data to ensure movement in a directionally consistent manner.

Based on the underlying data and our evidence gathered, we evaluated the reasonableness of management s conclusion on the adjustment to
 the factors.

We tested the accuracy of the mathematical application of the qualitative factors to adjust the historical loss experience.

Acquisition of Northwest Bancshares Corporation. - Fair Value of Acquired Loans and CDI 

As described further in Note 1 and Note 22 to the financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of Northwest Bancshares Corporation NWB on
 February 1, 2023. The Company accounted for this acquisition under the purchase method of accounting. Purchased assets and assumed liabilities are recorded at their respective acquisition date fair values, and identifiable intangible assets are
 recorded at fair value. Determination of the acquisition date fair value required management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The fair value of the acquired loans and CDI was 54.12 million and 1.41 million, respectively, as of
 February 1, 2023.

We identified the determination of the acquisition date fair value of acquired loans and the core deposit intangible CDI as a critical audit matter. The
 principal considerations for our determination included the high degree of judgment and subjectivity involved in auditing management s selection of assumptions used to determine fair value. This required a high degree of auditor effort, specialized
 skills and knowledge, and significant auditor judgment.

Our primary audit procedures performed to address
 this critical audit matter included :

We obtained an understanding of the Company s process for determining the fair value of the acquired loan portfolio and the CDI resulting
 from the merger.

We evaluated the completeness and accuracy of data inputs used as a basis for the valuation of the loan portfolio and CDI.

We evaluated, with the assistance of professionals with the appropriate skills and knowledge, the reasonableness of management s
 assumptions used in:

o 

The estimate of the fair value of the acquired loans, including, for a selected sample of loans, developing an independent expectation
 for comparison to management s fair value.

o 

The estimate of the fair value of the CDI, including, reperformance.

We tested the mathematical accuracy of the estimated fair values, including the application of the assumptions used in the calculation. 

/s/ 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.

to . The adoption of the
 ASU 2016-13 is expected to result in an increase in the allowance for loan losses as a result of changing from an incurred loss model, which encompasses allowances for current known and inherent losses within the portfolio, to an expected
 loss model, which encompasses allowances for losses expected to be incurred over the life of the portfolio. The Company is evaluating the final considerations of the qualitative adjustments utilized in the model. The amount determined from
 adoption will be recognized as a cumulative effective to the July 1, 2023 retained earnings.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 

Not applicable.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

(a)

Our management evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
 Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
 are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
 in the SEC s rules and regulations and are operating in an effective manner.

(b)

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company s internal control over financial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable
 assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
 with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material
 effect on the financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in
 accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
 periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
 over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control 
 Integrated Framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2023.

(c)

No change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially
 affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
