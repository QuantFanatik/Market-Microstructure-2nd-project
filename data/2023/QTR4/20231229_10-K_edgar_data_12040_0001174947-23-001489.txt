History and Development of Our Business 

We were incorporated in Florida
in 1959 and commenced operating as a chain of small cocktail lounges and package liquor stores throughout South Florida. By 1970, we had
established a chain of "Big Daddy's" lounges and package liquor stores between Vero Beach and Homestead, Florida. From 1970
to 1979, we expanded our package liquor store and lounge operations throughout Florida and opened clubs in five other "Sun Belt"
states. In 1975, we discontinued most of our package store operations in Florida except in the South Florida areas of Miami-Dade, Broward,
Palm Beach and Monroe Counties. In 1982, we expanded our club operations into the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area as general partner of
several limited partnerships we organized. In March 1985, we began franchising package liquor stores and lounges in the South Florida
area. (See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion of franchised units on pages 3 and 4). 

During our fiscal year 1987, we
began renovating our lounges to provide full restaurant food service, and subsequently renovated and added food service to most of our
lounges. Food sales currently represent approximately 78.71 and bar sales approximately 21.29 of our total restaurant sales. 

Our package liquor stores emphasize
high volume business by providing customers with a wide variety of brand name and private label merchandise at discount prices. Our restaurants
and our new sports bar establishment offer alcoholic beverages and food service with abundant portions and reasonable prices, served in
a relaxed, friendly and casual atmosphere. 

We conduct our operations directly
and through a number of limited partnerships and wholly owned subsidiaries, all of which are listed below. Our subsidiaries and the limited
partnerships, (except for the limited partnership, where we are not the general partner, which owns and operates our franchised restaurant
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida) are reported on a consolidated basis.

Package Liquor Store Operations 

Our package liquor stores emphasize
high volume business by providing customers with a wide selection of brand name and private label liquors, beers and wines while offering
competitive pricing by meeting the published sales prices of our competitors. We provide sales training to our package liquor store personnel.
The stores are open for business seven days a week from 9:00-10:00 a.m. to 9:00-10:00 p.m., depending upon demand and local law. Most
of our units have "night windows" with extended evening hours. 

Company-Owned Package Liquor
Stores . As of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we own and operate eleven package liquor stores in the South Florida area
under the name Big Daddy s Liquors or Big Daddy s Wine Liquors , two of which are jointly
operated with restaurants we own. 

Franchised Package Liquor Stores .
We currently franchise three package liquor stores, all in the South Florida area, all of which are operated under the name Big
Daddy s Liquors . Of the three franchised package liquor stores, two are jointly operated with our franchisee s restaurant
operations and one is operated in a freestanding building adjacent to the franchisee s restaurant operation. Two of the three franchised
package liquor stores are franchised to members of the family of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors. We have not entered
into a franchise arrangement for either a package liquor store, restaurant or combination package liquor store/restaurant since 1986 and
do not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future. 

Generally, a franchise agreement
with our franchisees for the operation of a package liquor store runs for the balance of the term of the franchisee s lease for
the business premises, extended by the franchisee s continued occupancy of the business premises thereafter, whether by lease or
ownership. In exchange for our providing management and related services to the franchisee and our granting the right to the franchisee
to use our service mark, Big Daddy s Liquors , franchisees of package liquor stores pay us weekly in arrears, (i) a
royalty equal to approximately 1 of gross sales; plus (ii) an amount for advertising equal to between 1-1/2 to 3 of gross sales generated
at the stores depending upon our actual advertising costs. 

For accounting purposes, we do
not consolidate the revenue and expenses of our franchisees operations with our revenue and expenses. Franchise royalties we receive
are recognized as revenue when sales are made by franchisees. 

Restaurant Operations 

Our restaurants provide a neighborhood
casual, standardized dining experience, typical of casual restaurant chains. The interior decor of the restaurants is nautical with numerous
fishing and boating pictures and decorations. The restaurants are designed to permit minor modifications without significant capital expenditures.
However, from time to time we are required to redesign and refurbish the restaurants at significant cost. Drink prices may vary between
locations to meet local conditions. Food prices are substantially standardized for all restaurants. The restaurants' hours of operation
are from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00-5:00 a.m. depending upon demand and local law. 

Company-Owned Restaurants .
We own and operate nine restaurants all under our service mark Flanigan s Seafood Bar and Grill three of which are jointly
operated with package liquor stores we own. We are constructing a stand-alone restaurant to be located in Hollywood, Florida to replace
our restaurant destroyed by fire. We believe this restaurant will be operational during our fiscal year 2024. 

Franchised Restaurants .
We franchise five restaurants, all of which operate under our service mark Flanigan s Seafood Bar and Grill , two of
which operate as a restaurant only, two of which operate jointly with a franchisee operated Big Daddy s Liquors package
liquor store and one of which operates adjacent to a Big Daddy s Liquors package liquor store. Four of the five franchised
restaurants are franchised to members of the family of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors. We have not entered into
a franchise arrangement for either a package liquor store, restaurant or combination package liquor store/restaurant since 1986 and do
not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future. 

Generally, a franchise agreement
with our franchisees for the operation of a restaurant runs for the balance of the term of the franchisee s lease for the business
premises, extended by the franchisee s continued occupancy of the business premises thereafter, whether by lease or ownership. In
exchange for our providing management and related services to the franchisee and our granting the right to the franchisee to use our service
mark, Flanigan s Seafood Bar and Grill , our franchisees pay us weekly in arrears, (i) a royalty equal to approximately
3 of gross sales; plus (ii) an amount for advertising equal to between 1-1/2 to 3 of gross sales from the restaurants depending upon
our actual advertising costs. 

For accounting purposes, we do
not consolidate the revenue and expenses of our franchisees operations with our revenue and expenses. Franchise royalties we receive
are recognized as revenue when sales are made by franchisees.

Restaurants Owned by Affiliated Limited Partnerships 

We have invested along with others,
(some of whom are or are affiliated with our officers and directors), in eleven limited partnerships which currently own and operate eleven
South Florida based restaurants under our service mark Flanigan s Seafood Bar and Grill . In addition to being a limited
partner in these limited partnerships, we are the sole general partner of ten of these limited partnerships and manage and control the
operations of these restaurants. We are only a limited partner in the limited partnership which owns and operates the restaurant located
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 

Generally, the terms of the limited partnership agreements
provide that until the investors cash investment in a limited partnership (including any cash invested by us) is returned in full,
(available cash is distributed to the investors pro-rata based on ownership interest), the limited partnership distributes to the investors
annually out of available cash from the operation of the restaurant, as a return of capital, up to 25 of the cash invested in the limited
partnership, with no management fee paid to us. Any available cash in excess of the 25 of the cash invested in the limited partnership
distributed to the investors annually, is paid one-half ) to us as a management fee and one-half ) to the investors,
(including us), pro-rata based on the investors investment, as a return of capital. Once all of the investors, (including us),
have received, in full, amounts equal to their cash invested, an annual management fee becomes payable to us equal to one-half )
of cash available to be distributed, with the other one-half ) of available cash distributed to the investors (including us),
as a profit distribution, pro-rata based on the investors investment. As of September 30, 2023, all limited partnerships, with
the exception of the 2022 Sunrise Restaurant, which opened for business in March, 2022 and the 2023 Miramar Restaurant, which opened for
business in April, 2023, have returned all cash invested and we receive an annual management fee equal to one-half ) of the cash
available for distribution by the limited partnership. In addition to receipt of distributable amounts from the limited partnerships,
we receive a fee equal to 3 of gross sales for use of our service marks Flanigan s Seafood Bar and Grill or Flanigan s ,
which use is authorized while we act as general partner only. This 3 fee is earned when sales are made by the limited partnerships
and is paid weekly, in arrears. Whether we will have any additional restaurants under development in the future will be dependent, among
other things, on market conditions and our ability to raise capital. We anticipate that we will continue to form limited partnerships
to raise funds to own and operate restaurants under our service marks Flanigan s Seafood Bar and Grill or Flanigan s 
using the same or substantially similar financial arrangements.

Management Agreement for The Whale s Rib Restaurant 

Since January 2006, we have managed
 The Whale s Rib , a casual dining restaurant located in Deerfield Beach, Florida, pursuant to a management agreement.
We paid 500,000 in exchange for our rights to manage this restaurant. The restaurant is owned by a third party unaffiliated with us.
In exchange for providing management, bookkeeping and related services, we receive one-half ) of the net profit, if any, from
the operation of the restaurant. For our fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, we generated 400,000 of revenue each
fiscal year from providing these management services. 

Operations and Management 

We emphasize systematic operations
and control of all package liquor stores and restaurants regardless of whether we own, franchise or manage the unit. Each unit has its
own manager who is responsible for monitoring inventory levels, supervising sales personnel, food preparation and service in restaurants
and generally assuring that the unit is managed in accordance with our guidelines and procedures. We have in effect an incentive cash
bonus program for our managers and salespersons based upon various performance criteria. Our operations are supervised by supervisors,
who visit all Company, limited partnership and franchise owned units and the managed unit to provide on-site management and support. There
are three supervisors responsible for package liquor store operations and six supervisors responsible for restaurant operations. 

All of our managers and salespersons
receive extensive training in sales techniques. We arrange for independent third parties, or "shoppers", to inspect each unit
in order to evaluate the unit's operations, including the handling of cash transactions. 

Purchasing and Inventory 

The package liquor business requires
a constant substantial capital investment in inventory at the stores. Our inventory consists primarily of liquor and wine products and
as such, does not become excessive or obsolete that would require identifying and recording of the same. Liquor inventory purchased can
normally be returned only if defective or broken. 

All of our purchases of liquor
inventory are made through our purchasing department from our corporate headquarters. The major portion of inventory is purchased under
individual purchase orders with licensed wholesalers and distributors who deliver the merchandise within one or two days of the placing
of an order. Frequently there is only one wholesaler in the immediate marketing area with an exclusive distributorship of certain liquor
product lines. Substantially all of our liquor inventory is shipped by the wholesalers or distributors directly to our stores. We significantly
increase our inventory prior to Christmas, New Year's Eve and other holidays. Under Florida law, we are required to pay for our liquor
purchases within ten days of delivery. 

Negotiations with food suppliers
are conducted by our purchasing department at our corporate headquarters. We believe this ensures that the best quality and prices will
be available to each restaurant. Orders for food products are prepared by each restaurant's kitchen manager and reviewed by the restaurant's
general manager before orders are placed. Food is delivered by the supplier directly to each restaurant. Orders are placed several times
a week to ensure product freshness. Food inventory is primarily paid for monthly. We purchase food and other commodities for use in our
operations based on market prices established with our suppliers. Many of the food products purchased by us can be subject to price volatility
due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control. We mitigate the risk of supply shortages and obtain competitive prices
by utilizing multiple qualified suppliers for substantially all our food products. 

We negotiate short-term and long-term
agreements for certain of our principal food product requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. We evaluate the
possibility of entering into arrangements to assist us in managing risk and variability associated with the supply and demand of food
products. 

In order to fix the cost and ensure
adequate supply of baby back ribs for our restaurants for calendar years 2023 and 2024, we entered into purchase agreements with our current
rib supplier, whereby we agreed to purchase approximately 6.8 million and 7.0 million of 2.25 Down Baby Back Ribs 
(industry jargon for the weight range in which slabs of baby back ribs are sold) from this vendor during calendar years 2023 and 2024
respectively, at prescribed costs, which we believe are competitive. The increase in our cost of baby back ribs for calendar year 2024
compared to calendar year 2023 is due to our purchase of ribs for Store #25, Miramar, Florida being open for the entire calendar year
and Store #19, Hollywood, Florida anticipated to be open for a part of the calendar year, offset by a decrease in market price. 

6 

While we anticipate purchasing
all of our rib supply from this vendor, we believe there are several other alternative vendors available, if needed. 

Information Technology 

Our
restaurant and package liquor store point-of-sale and back-office systems provide information regarding daily sales, cash receipts, inventory,
food and beverage costs, labor costs and other controllable operating expenses. Our restaurants and package liquor stores offer online
ordering for to-go sales and our package liquor stores also offer delivery services by third-party vendors. 

Restaurant
and package liquor store hardware and software support is provided by both our internal support services team as well as third-party vendors. Each
restaurant and package liquor store has a private high-speed wide area connection to send and receive critical business data as well as
to access web-based applications securely as well as a failover capability. All of our core and critical applications are backed
up to external data centers. To mitigate business interruptions, we utilize a data backup and replication infrastructure between
our onsite and external data centers, so all data is replicated nightly between the sites. 

We require cybersecurity awareness training for all staff members with
access to our cyber systems. We also maintain cyber risk insurance coverage to further reduce our risk profile. Security of our financial
data and other sensitive information remains a high priority for us, led by our information technology department. In an effort to further
secure our customers credit card information, we employ an encryption and tokenization platform for all credit card transactions
in our restaurants, ensuring no credit card data is stored in our internal systems. We also transact business through online ordering
for both our restaurants and package liquor stores through third party vendors. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors and the discussion of cybersecurity
risks on page 12.) 

Government Regulation 

Our operations are subject to
various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. In particular, our operations are subject to regulation by federal agencies
and to licensing and regulation by state and local health, food preparation and safety, sanitation, alcoholic beverage control, safety
and fire department agencies in the state or municipality where our units are located. 

Alcoholic beverage control regulations
require each of our restaurants and package liquor stores to obtain a license to sell alcoholic beverages from a state authority and in
certain locations, county and municipal authorities. 

In Florida, where all of our restaurants
and package liquor stores are located, most of our liquor licenses are issued on a "quota license" basis. Quota licenses are
issued on the basis of a population count established from time to time under the latest applicable census. Because the total number of
liquor licenses available under a quota license system is limited and restrictions are placed upon their transfer, the licenses have purchase
and resale value based upon supply and demand in the particular areas in which they are issued. The quota licenses held by us allow the
sale of liquor for on and off premises consumption (the 4 COP Quota Liquor License ). The other liquor licenses held by us
or limited partnerships of which we are the general partner, are restaurant liquor licenses, which do not have quota restrictions or purchase
or resale value. A restaurant liquor license is issued to every applicant who meets all of the state and local licensing requirements,
including, but not limited to zoning and minimum restaurant size, seating and menu. The restaurant liquor licenses held by us allow the
sale of liquor for on premises consumption only, (the 4 COP SFS Liquor License ). 

All licenses must be renewed annually
and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Suspension or revocation may result from violation by the licensee or its employees
of any federal, state or local law regulation pertaining to alcoholic beverage control. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate
to numerous aspects of the daily operations of our units, including, minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operations, advertising,
wholesale purchasing, inventory control, handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages, internal control and accounting. 

As the sale of alcoholic beverages
constitutes a large share of our revenue, the failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining a liquor license in a particular location
could adversely affect our operations in that location and could impair our ability to obtain licenses elsewhere. 

During our fiscal years 2023 and
2022, no significant pending matters have been initiated concerning any of our licenses which might be expected to result in a revocation
of a liquor license or other significant actions against us. 

We are subject to dram-shop 
statutes due to our restaurant operations. These statutes generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover
damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated individual. We carry liquor liability coverage
as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance, which we believe is consistent with coverage carried by other entities
in the restaurant industry. Although we are covered by insurance, a judgment against us under a dram-shop statute in excess of our liability
coverage could have a material adverse effect on us. We currently have no dram shop claims. 

7 

Our operations are also subject
to federal and state laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship requirements and overtime. Significant numbers
of hourly personnel at our restaurants are paid at rates related to the federal or Florida minimum wage, whichever is higher, and accordingly,
increases in the minimum wage will increase labor costs. We are also subject to the Americans with Disability Act of 1990 (ADA), which,
among other things, may require certain renovations to our restaurants to meet federally mandated requirements. The cost of any such renovations
is not expected to materially affect us. 

A significant number of our hourly
restaurant staff members receive income from gratuities. Many of our locations participate voluntarily in a Tip Reporting Alternative
Commitment TRAC agreement with the Internal Revenue Service IRS ). By complying with the educational and
other requirements of the TRAC agreement, we reduce the likelihood of potential employer-only FICA
(Federal Insurance Contributions Act) tax assessments for unreported or underreported tips. We are not under investigation or audit, nor
have we been assessed for potential employer-only FICA tax assessments for unreported or underreported tips. 

We are also subject to laws relating
to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud. 

We are not aware of any statute,
ordinance, rule or regulation under present consideration which would significantly limit or restrict our business as now conducted. However,
in view of the number of local jurisdictions within the State of Florida in which we conduct business, and the highly regulated nature
of the liquor business, there can be no assurance that additional limitations may not be imposed in the future, even though none are presently
anticipated. 

Human Capital 

We
depend on our staff members to successfully execute all aspects of our day-to-day operations. Our ability to attract highly motivated
staff members and retain an engaged, experienced team is key to successful execution of our strategy. We are currently operating in a
competitive labor environment. If we are unable to hire or retain qualified restaurant management and operating personnel in an increasingly
competitive market, we may be unable to effectively operate and grow our business and revenues, which could materially adversely affect
our financial performance. 

Development and Training 

We
invest resources to ensure our staff receive training in order to maximize their potential. In addition, we strive to provide our staff
with career advancement opportunities. Our training programs allow us to fill certain of our management positions with internal candidates. 

Benefits and Wellness 

We
believe access to healthcare is a compelling benefit for many staff members and we offer healthcare benefits to our hourly staff members
who work a minimum of 30 hours per week, on average. We attempt to provide a robust suite of benefits and wellness offerings. 

Employee Engagement 

Listening
to our staff members is an essential part of building an engaged workforce, and we provide avenues for staff to share their ideas and
concerns. 

As
of our fiscal year end 2023, we employed 1,855 persons, of which 707 were full-time and 1,148 were part-time. Of these, 57 were employed
at our corporate offices in administrative capacities and 12 were employed in maintenance. Of the remaining employees, 74 were employed
in our package liquor stores and 1,712 in our restaurants. None of our employees are represented by collective bargaining organizations.
We consider our labor relations to be favorable. 

8 

Giving Back 

Another
key aspect of our culture is giving back to the communities where our staff live and work, and uniting our staff members around
charitable causes personal to them. We periodically donate to philanthropic organizations through campaigns designed to engage our
staff company-wide service programs, as follows: 

Breast Cancer Awareness We donate 10,000 annually to local Breast Cancer Support organizations. 

Donated over 100,000 to HOPE mission. Money is used for disaster and hunger relief all over the world, youth outreach, and community building. 

Achievement Awards We provide schools in Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach County with free meal coins and achievement awards throughout the year. We give out approximately 50,000 awards every year. 

Fishing Tournaments/Marine Conservation We donate to fishing tournaments and beach cleanup projects. 

Supporting the local community We donate funds to boy scouts, baseball teams, schools, etc. 

Sheridan House We donated 500 backpacks to underprivileged children. We also collect and donate school supplies annually. 

Reclaimed Wood All of our locations use reclaimed wood on interior walls. 

We also believe our
sustainability programs and initiatives like restaurant-based composting and recycling and replacing our off-premise packaging with materials
that reduce the use of plastics and improve recyclability serve to foster pride in our staff.

Flanigan s 401(k) Plan 

Effective July 1, 2004, we began
sponsoring a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Employees may contribute
elective deferrals to the plan up to amounts allowed under the Internal Revenue Code. We are not required to contribute to the plan but
may make discretionary profit sharing and/or matching contributions. During our fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022,
the Board of Directors approved discretionary matching contributions totaling 70,000 and 71,000, respectively. 

Coronavirus Pandemic 

In March 2020, a novel strain
of coronavirus was declared a global pandemic and a National Public Health Emergency. The novel coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19 adversely affected and will, in all likelihood continue to adversely affect our restaurant operations and financial results for the foreseeable
future. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) permitted the federal Public Health Emergency for COVID-19 (PHE) declared by
the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (Secretary) under Section 319 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act to expire
at the end of the day on May 11, 2023. 

During the second quarter of our
fiscal year 2021, certain of the entities owning the limited partnership stores (the LP s ), as well as the store we
manage but do not own (the Managed Store ), applied for and received loans from an unrelated third party lender pursuant
to the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP under the United States Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the
 CARES Act enacted March 27, 2020, in the aggregate principal amount of approximately 3.98 million, (the 2 nd 
PPP Loans ), of which approximately: (i) 3.46 million was loaned to six of the LP and (ii) 0.52 million was loaned to
the Managed Store. The 2 nd PPP Loan to the Managed Store is not included in our consolidated financial statements. During the
first quarter of our fiscal year 2022, we applied for and received forgiveness of the entire amount of principal and accrued interest
for all 2 nd PPP Loans, including the Managed Store. 

9 

COVID-19 has had a material adverse
effect on our access to supplies or labor and there can be no assurance that there will not be a significant adverse impact on our supply
chain or access to labor in the future. We are actively monitoring our food suppliers to assess how they are managing their operations
to mitigate supply flow and food safety risks. To ensure we mitigate potential supply availability risk, we are building additional inventory
back stock levels when appropriate and we have also identified alternative supply sources in key product categories including but not
limited to food, sanitation and safety supplies. 

As of September 30, 2023, we are
in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our loans with our unrelated third-party institutional lender (the Institutional
Lender under which we owe in the aggregate, approximately 21,610,000 (the Institutional Loans of our total loans
of approximately 23,128,000. 

During the first quarter of our
fiscal year 2023, we satisfied the principal balance and all accrued interest due on our 5.5 million term loan to our unrelated lender.
The outstanding principal balance 367,000) and accrued interest -0-) were paid in full on December 28, 2022. 

In February 2023, we
determined that as of December 31, 2022, we did not meet the required Post-Distribution Basic Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the
 Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant contained in each of our six (6) loans (the Institutional
Loans with our unrelated third party institutional lender (the Institutional Lender ). On February 23, 2023, we
received from the Institutional Lender, a written waiver of the non-compliance with the Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant (the
 Covenant Non-Compliance ), pursuant to which, among other things, the Institutional Lender waived (1) the
non-compliance as of December 31, 2022 and (2) their right to exercise certain remedies under the Institutional Loans, including the
right to accelerate the indebtedness owed by us thereunder, resulting in the indebtedness under the Institutional Loans to be
immediately due and payable, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant
requires we maintain a ratio of at least 1.15 to 1.00 and for the twelve (12) months ended September 30, 2023 our ratio was
calculated to be 1.40 to 1.00. We have prepared projections going forward and expect to be in compliance. As a result, our
classification of debt is appropriate as of September 30, 2023. 

There can be no assurances that
we will be in compliance with our financial covenants thereafter due to, among other things, that our results of operations will likely
continue to be materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Absent a waiver, failure to be in compliance with our financial covenants
would constitute a default under the Institutional Loans with our Institutional Lender when reported. Such a default, if not cured or
waived, would allow the Institutional Lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness we owe under the Institutional Loans, making
it due and payable at the time. If maturity of the Institutional Loans were accelerated, it would have a material adverse impact on our
consolidated financial statements and results of operations. 

General Liability Insurance 

For the policy year beginning
December 30, 2022, we have general liability insurance which incorporates a deductible of 10,000 per occurrence for both us and the limited
partnerships. During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2023 we converted the deductible of 10,000 per occurrence for both us and
the limited partnerships to a 10,000 self-insured retention per occurrence. Our insurance carrier is responsible for 1,000,000 coverage
per occurrence above our deductible, up to a maximum aggregate of 2,000,000 per year. We were also able to purchase excess liability
insurance at a reasonable premium, whereby our excess insurance carrier is responsible for 10,000,000 coverage above our primary general
liability insurance coverage. We are uninsured against liability claims in excess of 11,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate.
We secured general liability and excess liability insurance for the period commencing after the expiration of the current policies on
December 30, 2023. The 10,000 self-insured retention per occurrence increases to 50,000 for us but remains the same at 10,000 for the
limited partnerships for the period commencing after the expiration of the current policies on December 30, 2023. (See Item 2. Subsequent
Events for a discussion of general liability and excess liability insurance for the period commencing December 30, 2023 on page 31.) 

Our general policy is to settle
only those legitimate and reasonable claims asserted and to aggressively defend and go to trial, if necessary, on frivolous and unreasonable
claims. Under our current liability insurance policy, certain expenses incurred in defending a claim, including attorney's fees, are a
part of our 10,000 deductible and/or our self-insured retention. 

In accordance with accounting
guidance, we accrue for any liability by recognizing costs when it is probable that a covered liability has been incurred and the cost
can be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, our annual insurance costs may be subject to adjustment from previous estimates as facts and
circumstances change. Our accruals are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in the caption "Accounts payable
and accrued expenses". A significant unfavorable judgment or settlement against us in excess of our liability insurance coverage
could have a materially adverse effect on the Company. 

10 

Property Insurance; Windstorm Insurance; Deductibles 

For
the policy year beginning December 30, 2022, our property insurance is a one (1) year policy with an unaffiliated third party insurance
carrier, including coverage for properties leased by us and our consolidated limited partnerships, and provides for full insurance coverage
for property losses, including those caused by windstorm, such as a hurricane. For property losses caused by windstorm, the property
insurance has a fixed deductible of 100,000, plus 5 of all insured losses, per occurrence. For all other property losses, the property
insurance has deductibles of 10,000 per location, per occurrence. We secured property insurance for the period commencing after the
expiration of the current policy on December 30, 2023. (See Item 2. Subsequent Events for a discussion of property insurance for the
period commencing December 30, 2023 on page 31.) 

Insurance Premiums 

Prior to fiscal year 2023,
we financed our annual insurance premiums. Due to higher interest rates, during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023, for the
policy year commencing December 30, 2022, we paid the premiums for property, general liability, excess liability and terrorist
policies, totaling approximately 3.281 million, which includes coverage for our franchisees (which is 658,000), which are not
included in our consolidated financial statements. Due to continuing higher interest rates, for the policy year commencing December
30, 2023 we will pay the premiums for property, general liability, excess liability, crime and terrorism policies in full without
financing. (See Item 2. Subsequent Events for a discussion of property, general liability, excess liability, crime and terrorism
insurance policies for the period commencing December 30, 2023 on page 31.) 

We paid the 3,281,000 annual
premium amounts on January 9, 2023, which includes coverage for our franchisees which are not included in our consolidated financial statements. 

Competition and the Company's Market 

The liquor and hospitality industries
are highly competitive and are often affected by changes in taste and entertainment trends among the public, by local, national and economic
conditions affecting spending habits, and by population and traffic patterns. We believe that the principal means of competition among
package liquor stores is price and that, in general, the principal means of competition among restaurants include the location, type and
quality of facilities and the type, quality and price of beverage and food served. 

Our package liquor stores compete
directly or indirectly with local retailers and discount superstores . Due to the competitive nature of the liquor industry
in South Florida, we have had to adjust our pricing to stay competitive, including meeting all competitors advertisements subject
to certain limitations. Such practices will continue in the package liquor business. We believe that we have a competitive position in
our market because of widespread consumer recognition of the "Big Daddy's Liquors" and Big Daddy s Wine Liquors 
names. 

Our restaurants compete directly
or indirectly with many well-established competitors, both nationally and locally owned. Effective March 26, 2023, we increased menu prices
for our food offerings to target an increase to our food revenues of approximately 2.06 annually and on March 20, 2023 we increased menu
prices for our bar offerings to target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 5.65 annually to offset higher food and liquor
costs and higher overall expenses. Effective October 3, 2021 and then effective December 19, 2021 we increased menu prices for our food
offerings to target an increase to our food revenues of approximately 2.38 and 3.34 annually, respectively, to offset higher food costs
and higher overall expenses and effective December 12, 2021 we increased menu prices for our bar offerings to target an increase to our
bar revenues of approximately 7.80 annually. Prior to these increases, we previously raised menu prices in the third quarter of our fiscal
year 2021. We believe that we have a competitive position in our market because of widespread consumer recognition of the Flanigan s
Seafood Bar and Grill" and Flanigan s names. 

We have many well-established
competitors, both nationally and locally owned, with substantially greater financial resources than we do. Their resources and market
presence may provide advantages in marketing, purchasing and negotiating leases. We compete with other restaurant and retail establishments
for sites and finding management personnel. 

Our business is subject to seasonal
effects, including that liquor purchases tend to increase during the holiday seasons. 

Trade Names 

We operate our package liquor
stores and restaurants under the service marks; "Big Daddy's Liquors", Big Daddy s Wine Liquors , Flanigan s
Seafood Bar and Grill", and Flanigan s . We operate our sports bar under the service mark; Brendan s
Sports Pub . Our right to the use of the "Big Daddy's" service mark is set forth under a consent decree of a federal court
entered into by us in settlement of federal trademark litigation. The consent decree and the settlement agreement allow us to continue
to use and to expand our use of the "Big Daddy's service mark in connection with our package liquor sales in Florida, while
restricting future liquor sales in Florida under the "Big Daddy's" name by the other party who has a federally registered service
mark for "Big Daddy's" use in the restaurant business. The federal court retained jurisdiction to enforce the consent decree.
We have acquired registered Federal trademarks on the principal register for our Big Daddy s Liquors , "Flanigan's"
and Flanigan s Seafood Bar and Grill service marks. 

11 

The standard symbolic trademark
associated with our facilities and operations is the bearded face and head of "Big Daddy" which is predominantly displayed at
all "Flanigan's" facilities and all "Big Daddy's" facilities throughout the country. The face comprising this trademark
is that of the Company s founder, Joseph "Big Daddy" Flanigan, and is a federally registered trademark owned by us. 

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

An investment in our common stock
involves a high degree of risk. These risks should be considered carefully with the uncertainties described below, and all other information
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties
not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial and therefore not referenced herein, may also become material
and may harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties
and you may lose part or all of your investment.

Risks Related to COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 Pandemic Has Had A Significant
Impact On Our Operations Since March 2020 And Could Materially And Adversely Affect Our Future Business And Financial Results. 

In March 2020, a novel strain
of coronavirus was declared a global pandemic and a National Public Health Emergency. The novel coronavirus pandemic and related suggested
and mandated social distancing and shelter-in-place orders and other governmental mandates relating thereto (collectively,
 COVID-19 caused significant disruptions to our business, adversely affected and will, in all likelihood continue to adversely
affect, our restaurant operations and financial results for the foreseeable future, particularly if further government directives are
put in place for a significant amount of time. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) permitted the federal Public Health Emergency
for COVID-19 (PHE) declared by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (Secretary) under Section 319 of the Public
Health Service (PHS) Act to expire at the end of the day on May 11, 2023. 

We have experienced significant issues relating to suppliers and labor
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If our suppliers employees are unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations
on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, or if the supply chain is disrupted for any other reason such
as travel limitations and other restrictions on commerce, we could face shortages of food items or other supplies at our restaurants and
our operations and sales could be adversely impacted by such supply interruptions. 

The impact of COVID-19, and the volatile regional
and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, may also precipitate or exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A -
Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report, any of which could have a material effect on us. If we are not able to respond to and manage
the impact of such events effectively, our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted. 

Risks Related to Our Business 

If we are unable to
staff and retain qualified restaurant and package liquor store management and operating personnel in an increasingly competitive market,
we may be unable to effectively operate and grow our business and revenues, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

12 

Similar
to the broader economy, we are experiencing labor shortfalls relative to our sales levels in certain parts of our workforce. If we are
unable to attract and retain qualified people, our restaurants could be short staffed, we may be forced to incur overtime expenses, and
our ability to operate and expand our concepts effectively and to meet our customers demand could be limited, any of which could
materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

We have experienced
and continue to experience significant labor cost inflation. If we are unable to offset higher labor costs, our cost of doing business
will significantly increase, which could materially adversely impact our financial performance . 

Increases
in minimum wages and minimum tip credit wages, extensions of personal and other leave policies, other governmental regulations affecting
labor costs and a diminishing pool of potential staff members when the unemployment rate falls and legal immigration is restricted, especially
in certain localities, could significantly increase our labor costs and make it more difficult to fully staff our restaurants, any of
which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

We
believe the United States federal government may significantly increase the federal minimum wage and tip credit wage (or eliminate the
tip credit wage) and require significantly more mandated benefits than what is currently required under federal law. The State of Florida
has already enacted a minimum wage and tip credit, with the minimum wage currently at 12.00 per hour and a tip credit of 3.02 per hour.
The minimum wage increases 1.00 per hour annually until it reaches 15.00 per hour in 2027. The tip credit does not increase. In addition
to increasing the overall wages paid to our minimum wage and tip credit wage earners, these increases create pressure to increase wages
and other benefits paid to other staff members who, in recognition of their tenure, performance, job responsibilities and other similar
considerations, historically received a rate of pay exceeding the applicable minimum wage or minimum tip credit wage. Because we employ
a large workforce, any wage increase and/or expansion of benefits mandates will have a particularly significant impact on our labor costs.
Our vendors, contractors and business partners are similarly impacted by wage and benefit cost inflation, and many have or will increase
their price for goods, construction and services in order to offset their increasing labor costs. Additionally, while our employees are
not currently covered by any collective bargaining agreements, union organizers may engage in efforts to organize our employees and those
of other restaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to unionize, our labor costs could increase and it could
negatively impact our culture, reduce our flexibility and disrupt our business. In addition, our responses to any union organizing efforts
could negatively impact our reputation and dissuade guests from patronizing our restaurants. 

Our
labor expenses include significant costs related to our health benefit plans. Health care costs continue to rise and are especially difficult
to project. Material increases in costs associated with medical claims, or an increase in the severity or frequency of such claims, may
cause health care costs to vary substantially from year-over-year. Given the unpredictable nature of actual health care claims trends,
including the severity or frequency of claims, in any given year our health care costs could significantly exceed our estimates,
which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

Any
significant changes to the healthcare insurance system could impact our healthcare costs. Material increases in healthcare costs could
materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

While
we try to offset labor cost increases through price increases, more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements and greater
economies of scale, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. If we are unable to effectively anticipate and respond
to increased labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. 

Our Sales and Profit Growth Could Be
Adversely Affected If Comparable Restaurant Sales Increases Are Less Than We Expect, and We May Not Successfully Increase Comparable Restaurant
Sales or They May Decrease. 

While future sales growth
will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants, changes in comparable restaurant sales (which represent the change in period-over-period
sales for restaurants) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth. This is because
the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be
spread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can have a significant adverse effect on profitability
due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases. There is no assurance
that comparable restaurant sales will increase in fiscal year 2024 due to, among other things, ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty. 

13 

Our ability to increase comparable
restaurant sales depends on many factors, including: 

perceptions of the Flanigan s brand; 

competition, especially from an increasing number of competitors in the fast casual segment of the restaurant industry and from other restaurants whose strategies overlap ours, as well as from grocery stores, meal kit delivery services and other dining options; 

executing our strategies effectively, including our marketing and branding strategies; 

changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending; 

our ability to increase menu prices without adversely affecting our existing business; 

weather, natural disasters and other factors limiting access to our restaurants; and 

changes in government regulation that may impact customer perceptions of our food. 

As a result, it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable
restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative. A number of these factors are beyond our control
and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustain comparable restaurant sales increases. 

High Unemployment, Instability in the Housing
Market, High Energy and Food Costs and General Economic Uncertainty Could Result in a Decline in Consumer Discretionary Spending That
Would Materially Affect our Financial Performance. 

COVID-19 has had a significant
impact on domestic economies and will likely continue to negatively impact these economies for some time. Dining out is a discretionary
expense. In addition to COVID-19, factors that affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining, such as changes in general
economic conditions (including national, regional and local economic conditions), discretionary spending patterns, employment levels,
instability in the housing market, and high energy and food costs may have a material adverse effect on us. If economic conditions worsen,
our financial performance could be adversely affected. 

Intense Competition In The Restaurant And Package Liquor Store Industry
Could Prevent Us From Increasing Or Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability. 

The restaurant and package liquor
store industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and location and many
restaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-established competitors with
substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitors are well established
in the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores or where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally, other companies may develop
restaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts. 

Any inability to compete successfully
with the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability and
will result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may also need to
modify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular new restaurant formats or store concepts
that may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing these modifications or that these
modifications will not reduce our profitability. 

New Information Or Attitudes Regarding Diet
And Health Could Result In Changes In Regulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely Affect Our Revenues. 

Regulations and consumer
eating habits may change because of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may include regulations that
impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants. For example, a number of states, counties and cities
are enacting menu-labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritional information available to guests
or restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. The success of our restaurant operations is dependent, in part,
upon our ability to respond effectively to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations and to adapt our menu offerings to trends
in eating habits. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or delete
certain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to our menu offerings, it could materially affect
customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues. 

14 

Adverse Public Or Medical Opinions About Health
Effects Of Consuming Our Products As Well As Negative Publicity About Us, Our Restaurants And/Or Package Liquor Stores And About Others
Across The Food And Liquor Industry Supply Chain, Whether Or Not Accurate, Could Negatively Affect Us. 

Restaurant operators have received more scrutiny from
regulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consuming certain products. An unfavorable report
on the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of those items could influence the demand for our offerings.
In addition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, of food quality issues, illness, injury, health concerns, or
operating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited number of restaurants, restaurants operated by others or generally in the
food supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industry overall and specifically harm our reputation. A decrease in guest traffic
because of these types of health concerns or negative publicity could materially harm our results of operations. 

Our Inability To Successfully And Sufficiently
Raise Menu Prices Could Result In A Decline In Profitability. 

We utilize menu price increases
to help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements, construction,
utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted by consumers and reduce
guest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be negatively affected. However, we have not
experienced any adverse effects from past menu price increases. 

Increases in Food Costs, Raw Materials and Other
Supplies and Services Due to Inflation May Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Financial Performance. 

Our operating margins depend on,
among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and beverage
costs, utilities and other supplies and services due to inflation. We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements for our
principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we are currently
unable to contract for extended periods of time for certain of our commodities. Consequently, these commodities can be subject to unforeseen
supply and cost fluctuations due to factors such as changes in demand patterns, increases in the cost of key inputs, fuel costs, weather
and other market conditions outside of our control caused by inflation. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation. Our
suppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higher minimum wage and benefit
costs, and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied
to us. 

Shortages or Interruptions in the Supply
of Food Offering Ingredients and/or Liquor Inventory Could Adversely Affect our Operating Results. 

Our
business is dependent on frequent and consistent deliveries of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory. We may experience shortages,
delays or interruptions in the supply of ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants due to inclement weather, natural disasters,
labor issues or other operational disruptions at our suppliers, distributors or transportation providers or other conditions beyond our
control. In addition, we have a single or a limited number of suppliers for some of our ingredients, including baby back ribs. Although
we believe we have potential alternative suppliers and sufficient reserves of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory, shortages
or interruptions in our supply of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory could adversely affect our financial results. 

Our Business Could Be Materially Adversely Affected
If We Are Unable To Expand In A Timely And Profitable Manner. 

To grow successfully, we must open new restaurants
and/or package liquor stores on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienced delays in restaurant and/or package liquor store openings
from time to time and may experience delays in the future. During our fiscal year 2023, we opened our new limited partnership owned restaurant
in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) for business, as well as our company owned package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) and our
newly built stand-alone package liquor store in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) for business, replacing our package liquor store destroyed
by fire which previously operated at that site. During our fiscal year 2023, we also continued constructing a stand-alone building on
the same site in Hollywood, Florida adjacent to Store #19P, replacing our restaurant destroyed by fire which previously operated at that
site (Store #19R). We anticipate that the restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) will open for business in March 2024. 

Our ability to open and profitably
operate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availability of suitable and economically
viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations, the availability of limited partner
investors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals) on a timely
basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors, the availability
of construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, variations in labor and building material
costs, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more
restaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount of time. If we are unable to manage these risks successfully, we
will face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues which will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition,
operating results and cash flow. 

15 

Changes In Customer Preferences For Casual Dining
Styles Could Adversely Affect Financial Performance. 

Changing customer preferences,
tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, side dishes
and desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. A change from this
dining style may have an adverse effect on our business. 

Our Success Depends Substantially on the Value
of our Brands and our Reputation for Offering Guests a Satisfactory Experience. 

We believe we have built a reasonably
strong reputation for the predictability of our menu items, as part of the experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants. We believe
we must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodes consumer trust in
or affinity for our brands could be harmful to us. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in food quality, service or ambiance,
or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer. 

Our Marketing And Advertising Strategies May
Not Be Successful, Which Could Adversely Impact Our Business. 

From time to time, we introduce
new advertising campaigns and media strategies. If our advertising campaign and new media strategies do not resonate with customers in
the manner we hope, they may not result in increased sales, but would still increase our expenses. We will continue to invest in marketing
and advertising strategies that we believe will attract customers or increase their connection with our brand. If these marketing and
advertising investments do not drive increased restaurant and/or package store sales, the expense associated with these programs will
adversely impact our financial results, and we may not generate the levels of comparable sales we expect. 

Labor Shortages, An Increase In Labor Costs, Or Inability To Attract
Employees Could Harm Our Business. 

Our employees are essential to
our operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers. If we are unable to attract and retain enough
qualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience,
our results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages, which
could result in higher labor costs. 

Due To Our Geographic Locations, Restaurants
Are Subject To Climate Conditions That Could Affect Operations. 

All but one (1) of our restaurants
and package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. During hurricane season,
(June 1 through November 30 each year), our restaurants and/or package liquor stores may face harsh weather associated with hurricanes
and tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficult for customers to visit our restaurants and package liquor
stores or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurants for a period of time. If customers are unable to visit our restaurants
and/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating results may be negatively affected. 

If We Were to Experience Widespread Difficulty
Renewing Existing Leases on Favorable Terms, Our Revenue or Occupancy Costs Could be Adversely Affected. 

Most
of the properties on which we operate restaurants are leased from third parties, and some of our leases are due for renewal or extension
options in the next several years. Some leases expire without any renewal options. While we currently expect to pursue the renewal of
substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases, any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases, or any substantial increase
in rents associated with lease renewals, could adversely impact us. If we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties in renewing
leases, we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants. Substantial
increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs, reducing our restaurant margins. 

Due To Our Geographic Locations, We May Not
Be Able To Acquire Windstorm Insurance Coverage Or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage At A Reasonable Rate. 

Due to the anticipated active
hurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurant and package
liquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates. If
we are unable to obtain windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, then we will be self-insured
for all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, which may have a material adverse effect
upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. We secured windstorm insurance coverage for the period commencing December
30, 2023 at a higher premium. (See Item 2. Subsequent Events for a discussion of windstorm insurance for the period commencing December
30, 2023 on page 31. 

16 

Our Inability or Failure to Execute a Comprehensive Business Continuity
Plan at our Restaurant Support Centers Following a Disaster or Force Majeure Event could have a Material Adverse Impact on our Business.

Many
of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant and package liquor store operations are centralized at
one location. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address crisis-level events, including
hurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information
and the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a limited test of our ability to manage our business remotely. However, if we are unable to fully
implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness
in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and
operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative
and other legal claims. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, which increases the difficulty of accurately and timely predicting,
planning for and protecting against the threat. As a result, our disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans security may
not adequately address all threats we face or protect us from loss. 

Inability To Attract And Retain Customers Could
Affect Results Of Operations. 

We take pride in our ability to
attract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they may not return and
results may be negatively affected. 

A Failure To Comply With Governmental Regulations
Could Harm Our Business And Our Reputation. 

We are subject to regulation by
federal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departments relating to
the development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to the following: 

the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages; 

employment; 

building construction and access; 

zoning requirements; and 

the environment. 

Our facilities are licensed and
subject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes. The construction and remodeling of restaurants will be subject
to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessary licenses or other
approvals on a cost-effective and timely basis in order to construct and develop restaurants in the future. 

Various federal and state labor
laws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefit and work
authorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations. Given the location of many of our restaurants,
even if we operate those restaurants in strict compliance with federal immigration requirements, our employees may not all meet federal
work authorization or residency requirements, which could lead to disruptions in our work force. 

Our business can be adversely affected by negative
publicity resulting from, among other things, complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borne illness or other health
concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Unfavorable publicity could negatively impact public
perception of our brands. 

We are required to comply
with the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants are located. Alcoholic
beverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities for
a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause
at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of the restaurants, including minimum
age of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing
of alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations, our licenses may be revoked and we may be forced
to terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants. 

17 

The Federal Americans with
Disabilities Act (the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment.
We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connection with the
construction of new facilities and with significant renovations of existing facilities. 

Failure to comply with
these and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. 

We May Face Liability Under Dram Shop
Statutes. 

Our sale of alcoholic beverages
subjects us to dram shop statutes, which allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic
beverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage, or if we fail to maintain
our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
There are currently no dram shop claims pending against us. See Item 1. Business Government Regulation 
for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply. 

Concerns relating
to pandemics and other diseases, food safety and food-borne illness could reduce customer traffic to our restaurants, disrupt our food
supply chain or cause us to be the target of litigation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

The
COVID-19 pandemic had a significant adverse impact on our customer traffic and ability to operate our restaurants and may do so again
in the foreseeable future. Future pandemics and other diseases may have a similar or more severe impact. 

In years past, several
nationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach, which
is not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of mad
cow disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (such as, hepatitis A,
trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect the price
and availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference. As a result, our sales could decline. 

Instances of food-borne
illnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity about us
or the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or other key aspects
of the dining experience we offer, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers
to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could be forced
to temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result
of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants, could materially harm our business. 

If We Are Unable To Protect Our Customers 
Credit Card Data, We Could Be Exposed To Data Loss, Litigation And Liability, And Our Reputation Could Be Significantly Harmed. 

In connection with credit card
sales, we transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. Although we use private networks, third
parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connection with credit card
sales, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access
to this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information
or disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, and liability, and could seriously disrupt
our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation. We have not experienced any security breaches
to date. 

If We Experience a Significant Failure in or
Interruption of Certain Key Information Technology Systems, our Business Could Be Adversely Impacted. 

We use a variety of applications
and systems to manage the flow of information securely within each of our restaurants and within our centralized corporate infrastructure.
The services available within our systems and applications include restaurant and store operations, supply chain, inventory, scheduling,
training, human capital management, financial tools and data protection services. The restaurant and store structure is based primarily
on a point-of-sale system that operates locally and is integrated with other functions necessary to operations. It records sales transactions,
receives out of store orders and authorizes, batches and transmits credit card transactions. The system also allows employees to enter
time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports. Select information that is captured from this system at each restaurant
or store is collected in the central corporate infrastructure, which enables management to continually monitor operating results. Our
ability to manage efficiently and effectively our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these and other systems
and our operations depend substantially on the availability of our point-of-sale system and related networks and applications. These systems
may be vulnerable to attacks or outages from security breaches, viruses and other disruptive problems, as well as from physical theft,
fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Any failure of these systems to operate effectively, whether
from security breaches, maintenance problems, upgrades or transitions to new platforms, or other factors could result in interruptions
to or delays in our restaurant or other operations, adversely impacting the restaurant or store experience for our customers or negatively
impacting our ability to manage our business. If our information technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery
plans are not adequate to address such failures, or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any
losses that we may incur, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially
adversely affected. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses.

The Effect of Recent Changes to U.S. Healthcare Laws May Increase
Our Healthcare Costs and Negatively Impact Our Financial Results. 

We offer eligible full-time
employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by the Company. For various reasons, many of our eligible employees
currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans. However, under the comprehensive U.S. health care reform law enacted in 2010,
the Affordable Care Act, certain provisions, including, the employer mandate, may increase our labor costs significantly. In general,
implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act is likely to impose additional administrative costs on us. The costs and other
effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determined with certainty, but they may have a material adverse effect on our financial
and operating results. 

Governmental Regulation in One or More
of the Following Areas May Adversely Affect Our Existing and Future Operations and Results, Including by Harming Our Ability to Open New
Restaurants or Increasing Our Operating Costs. 

Employment
and Immigration Regulations 

We
are subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, including
wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, healthcare, family leave mandates, requirements regarding
working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and
workers compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can
be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance. For example, historically, lawsuits have been filed
against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime. We could suffer losses from
and we incur legal costs to defend, these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. In addition,
several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases, paid
sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increase our labor costs. Changes in U.S.
healthcare laws could also adversely impact us if they result in significant new welfare and benefit costs or increased compliance expenses. 

We
also are subject to being audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements. From time to time,
the State of Florida considers adopting new state immigration laws and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from time
to time consider or implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Changes in immigration
or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make
our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us with
government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized
workers. We currently participate in the E-Verify program, an Internet-based, free program run by the U.S. government to
verify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company. However, use of E-Verify does not guarantee that we will properly
identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and we could experience
adverse publicity that negatively affects our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Termination of
a significant number of employees would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adverse
publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees. We could also become subject to fines, penalties
and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance
laws. Our reputation and financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors. 

On the other hand, in the event we wrongfully reject
work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparate impact on a protected class, such as a racial
minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants, we could be found to be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. We could
experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity related to work authorization compliance, anti-discrimination compliance,
or both, that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Moreover, our business
could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants. 

19 

Additionally,
while we do not currently have any unionized employees, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of other restaurant
companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increase and our efforts to
maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired. Potential changes in labor laws, including the possible
passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize, could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees
being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing
requirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture. 

Americans
with Disabilities Act and Similar State Laws 

We
are subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals
with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We have incurred legal fees in connection with
ADA-related complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access ramps or redesigning
certain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws. The expenses
associated with these modifications or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ADA
or similar state laws, could be material. 

Nutrition
and Food Regulation 

In
recent years there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levels on the
food industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casual segments have
been a particular focus. For example, the State of California, New York City and a number of other jurisdictions around the U.S. have
adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menus and/or make other nutritional information
available and nation-wide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the U.S. health care reform law went into effect as of December 1,
2015. These nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customers as they select their food and beverage choices
decreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customers buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales. 

Privacy/Cybersecurity 

We
are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of some
of our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and the regulatory
environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. If our security and information systems are compromised
or if we otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could
adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types
of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees. 

Local Licensure, Zoning and Other Regulation 

Each
of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, food and workplace
safety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new
restaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect
to zoning, use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations. 

Environmental
Laws 

We
are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal
of hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances relating to our operations. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental
review of our properties or operations. We cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future, how existing or future
environmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or
to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws. 

We Could Be
Party To Litigation That Could Adversely Affect Us By Distracting Management, Increasing Our Expenses or Subjecting Us to Material Money
Damages and Other Remedies. 

We
could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material
money damages and other remedies. We could become subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace
and employment matters, including wages, work hours, overtime, vacation and family leave, discrimination, wrongful termination and similar
matters, and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters. Our customers could file
complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our
restaurants or that we have problems with food quality, operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices. The restaurant
industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertising
practices. 

20 

Regardless of whether
any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable for such claims, they may be expensive to defend and may divert
time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims against us could materially and
adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations, whether directed
at us or at fast casual or quick-service restaurants generally, may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects,
which in turn could adversely affect our results. 

Our Success
May Depend on the Continued Service and Availability of Key Personnel. 

Our
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President, James Flanigan, has been the principal architect of our business strategy since 2002.
August Bucci, Jeffrey Kastner and Christopher O Neil, our Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of
Package Operations, respectively, have also served with us since 2002 in the case of Mr. Bucci, since 2004 in the case of Mr. Kastner
and 2016 in the case of Mr. O Neil, and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well. We believe our executive
officers have created an employee culture, food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success and
that may be difficult to replicate under another management team. We also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain executive
officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision. If our company culture were to deteriorate following a change
in leadership, or if a new management team were to be unsuccessful in executing our strategy or were to change important elements of our
current strategy, our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted. 

We Are Exposed to Risks Related to Cybersecurity. 

Although
we maintain systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology,
there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security. Any material incidents could cause us to experience
financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us and increased expenses
related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and
are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, as cyber threats evolve and become
more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take
to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software,
disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate
these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched,
and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. If our information security
systems or data are compromised in a material way, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may incur financial losses
and we may incur costs to remediate possible harm and/or to pay fines or take other action which could have a material adverse impact
on our business. 

If There is
a Material Failure in our Information Technology Systems, Our Business Operations and Profits Could Be Negatively Affected and our Systems
may be Inadequate to Support our Future Growth Strategies. 

We
rely heavily on information technology systems in all aspects of our operations including our restaurant point-of sale systems, financial
systems, marketing programs, employee engagement, supply chain management, cyber-security, and various other processes and transactions.
Our ability to effectively manage and run our business depends on the reliability and capacity of our information technology systems,
including technology services and systems for which we contract from third parties. These systems and services may be insufficient to
effectively manage and run our business. These systems and our business needs will continue to evolve and require upgrading and maintenance
over time, consequently requiring significant future commitments of resources and capital. 

Moreover,
these technology services and systems, communication systems, and electronic data could be subject or vulnerable to damage or interruption
from hurricanes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, loss of data, data breaches,
or other attempts to harm our systems. A failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement
systems, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure information technology network for any of the above reasons could result
in interruption and delays in customer services, adversely affect our reputation, and negatively impact our results of operations. 

21 

Acts of Violence
at or Threatened Against our Restaurants or the Centers in which they are Located, including Active Shooter Situations and Terrorism,
Could Unfavorably Impact our Restaurant Sales, Which Could Materially Adversely Affect our Financial Performance. 

Any
act of violence at or threatened against our restaurants or the centers in which they are located, including active shooter situations
and terrorist activities, may result in restricted access to our restaurants and/or restaurant closures in the short-term and, in the
long-term, may cause our customers and staff to avoid our restaurants. Any such situation could adversely impact customer traffic and
make it more difficult to staff our restaurants fully, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

The occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, such
as active shooter or future terrorist attacks military and governmental responses, and the protest of future wars, may result in negative
changes to economic conditions likely resulting in decreased consumer spending. Additionally, decreases in consumer discretionary spending
may impact the frequency with which our customers choose to dine out at restaurants or the amount they spend on meals while dining out
at restaurants, thereby adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. A decrease in consumer discretionary spending may also
adversely affect our ability to achieve the benefit of planned menu price increases to help preserve our operating margins. 

Social Media
Impact on Customer Perceptions of our Brand. 

The
considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated.
The adverse impact of publicity on customers perception of us could have a further negative impact on our sales. If the impact
of any such publicity is particularly long-lasting, the value of our brand may suffer and our ability to grow could be diminished. 

Our Digital
Business, Which Has Become an Increasingly Significant Part of Our Business, is Subject to Risks. 

Primarily
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue derived from digital orders, which includes delivery and customer pickup has increased substantially.
While we are uncertain as to whether this business will continue to increase and/or be significant, we have implemented technology, targeted
advertising and promotions and to some extent remodeled our restaurants, to accommodate the growth of our digital business. If we do not
continue to grow our digital business, it may be difficult for us to recoup these costs or achieve our sales growth potential. We rely
on third-party delivery services to fulfill package store delivery orders, and the ordering and payment platforms used by these third-parties,
or online ordering system, could be interrupted by technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks or other factors, which could adversely
impact sales through these channels and negatively impact our reputation. Additionally, our delivery partners are responsible for order
fulfillment and errors or failures to make timely deliveries could cause guests to stop ordering from us. The third-party delivery business
is competitive, with a number of players competing for market share and delivery drivers. If the third-party delivery services that
we utilize cease or curtail operations, increase their fees, or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors,
our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted. 

Our Institutional
Lender No Longer Originates, Renews or Modifies loans at LIBOR Effective January 1, 2022. 

Effective January 1, 2022, our
institutional lender no longer originates, renews or modifies loans at LIBOR, except in limited situations. As of September 30, 2023,
we had one variable rate instrument outstanding that is impacted by changes in interest rates. The variable rate debt instrument is equal
to the lender s BSBY Screen Rate plus one and one-half percent (1.50 per annum. As a means of managing our interest rate risk
on the debt instrument, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with our unrelated third party lender to convert this variable
rate debt obligation to fixed rate. 

ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 

As a Smaller Reporting Company
as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations

All of our units require
periodic refurbishing in order to remain competitive. We have budgeted 450,000 for our refurbishing program for fiscal year 2024,
although capital expenditures of our refurbishing program for our fiscal year 2024 may be significantly higher. See Item 7,
"Liquidity and Capital Resources" for discussion of the amounts spent in fiscal year 2023. The following table summarizes
information related to the properties upon which our operations are conducted. For all locations that include lease options, the
lessor must extend the term of the lease for a location if we exercise the lease option. If there is no lease option or if we do not
exercise the same, the lessor is not required to extend the term of the lease upon expiration.

We have re-purchased from the unaffiliated third parties and currently own 52 of the underlying ground lease, as well as the sublease agreement. As a result, we pay all rent due under the ground lease, but only 48 of the rent due under the sublease agreement.

(9) 
 During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019, our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19), was damaged by a fire and was forced to close. We determined that Store #19 should be demolished and rebuilt as separate buildings. During our first quarter year 2023 we opened our company owned newly built stand-alone package liquor store in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) for business. During our fiscal year 2023, we also continued constructing a stand-alone building on the same site in Hollywood, Florida adjacent to Store #19P, replacing our restaurant destroyed by fire which previously operated at that site (Store #19R).

Casualty Loss 

During the first quarter of our
fiscal year 2019, our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19)
was damaged by a fire and was forced to close. The package liquor store re-opened for business during the first quarter of our fiscal

OVERVIEW 

Financial Information Concerning Industry Segments 

Our business is conducted principally
in two segments: the restaurant segment and the package liquor store segment. Financial information broken into these two principal industry
segments for the two fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 is set forth in the Consolidated Financial Statements which
are attached hereto. 

General 

As of September 30, 2023, we (i)
operated 31 units, consisting of restaurants, sports bar, package liquor stores and combination restaurants/package liquor stores that
we either own or have operational control over and partial ownership in; and (ii) franchises an additional five units, consisting of two
restaurants (one of which we operate) and three combination restaurants/package liquor stores. 

Franchised Units . In exchange
for our providing management and related services to our franchisees and granting them the right to use our service marks "Flanigan's
Seafood Bar and Grill" and "Big Daddy's Liquors", our franchisees (four of which are franchised to members of the family
of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors), are required to (i) pay to us a royalty equal to 1 of gross package liquor
sales and 3 of gross restaurant sales; and (ii) make advertising expenditures equal to between 1.5 to 3 of all gross sales based upon
our actual advertising costs allocated between stores, pro-rata, based upon gross sales. 

Affiliated Limited Partnership
Owned Units . We manage and control the operations of the ten restaurants owned by limited partnerships, except the Fort Lauderdale,
Florida restaurant which is managed and controlled by a related franchisee. Accordingly, the results of operations of all limited partnership
owned restaurants, except the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant are consolidated with our results of operations for accounting purposes.
The results of operations of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant are accounted for by us utilizing the equity method.

Comparison of Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2023 and October 1,
2022 

Revenues. Total
revenue for our fiscal year 2023 increased 16,264,000 or 10.29 to 174,396,000 from 158,132,000 for our fiscal year 2022 due primarily
to increased package liquor store and restaurant sales, increased menu prices, revenue generated from the opening of our limited partnership
owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) in April 2023, the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise,
Florida (Store #85) and the operation of Brendan s Sports Pub (Store #30) for our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part of
our fiscal year 2022, the opening of the package liquor store in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) in December 2022, the opening of the
package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) in March, 2023 and the comparatively less adverse effects of COVID-19 on our operations
for our current fiscal year. Additionally, effective March 26, 2023 we increased menu prices for our food offerings to target an increase
to our food revenues of approximately 2.06 and effective March 19, 2023 we increased menu prices for our bar offerings to target an increase
to our bar revenues of approximately 5.65 annually, to offset higher food costs and higher overall expenses (collectively the Recent
Price Increases ). Prior to these increases, we previously raised menu prices in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022. We note
that the Recent Price Increases also contributed to our increased revenues 

Restaurant Food Sales . 
Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of food, including non-alcoholic beverages, at restaurants totaled 107,238,000 for our fiscal
year 2023 as compared to 97,429,000 for our fiscal year 2022. The increase in restaurant food sales for our fiscal year 2023 as compared
to restaurant food sales during our fiscal year 2022 is attributable to the Recent Price Increases, restaurant food sales generated from
the opening of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) in April 2023, and the operation of our limited
partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85) and the operation of Brendan s Sports Pub (Store #30) for our entire
fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2022 and the comparatively greater adverse effects of COVID-19 on our operations
during the our fiscal year 2022 as compared with our fiscal year 2023. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales (for restaurants open for
all of our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 respectively, which consists of nine restaurants owned by us and nine restaurants owned by affiliated
limited partnerships, (excluding our Miramar, Florida location (Store #25), Brendan s Sports Pub, (Store #30), and Sunrise, Florida
location (Store #85), which opened for business during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023, the third quarter of our fiscal year
2022 and the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022, respectively) was 1,734,000 and 1,798,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively,
a decrease of 3.56 . Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for Company owned restaurants only was 835,000 and 886,000 for our fiscal
years 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of 5.76 . Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for affiliated limited partnership owned
restaurants only, (excluding Store #25 which opened for business during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023 and Store #85 which
opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022), was 898,000 and 912,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 respectively,
a decrease of 1.54 . We expect that restaurant food sales, including non-alcoholic beverages, for our fiscal year 2024 will increase due
to increased restaurant traffic, Store #25 being open for business for our entire fiscal year 2024 and the opening of our reconstructed
restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) for business during our fiscal year 2024. 

Restaurant Bar Sales . 
Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages at restaurants totaled 29,000,000 for our fiscal year 2023 as compared
to 26,198,000 for our fiscal year 2022. The increase in restaurant bar sales during our fiscal year 2023 is primarily due to the Recent
Price Increases, restaurant bar sales generated from the opening of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store
#25) in April 2023, and the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85) and the operation of
Brendan s Sports Pub (Store #30) for our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2022 and the comparatively
greater adverse effects of COVID-19 on our operations during the our fiscal year 2022 as compared with our fiscal year 2023. Comparable
weekly restaurant bar sales (for restaurants open for all of our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 respectively, which consists of nine restaurants
owned by us and nine restaurants owned by affiliated limited partnerships, (excluding our Miramar, Florida location (Store #25), Brendan s
Sports Pub (Store #30), and Sunrise, Florida (Store #85), which opened for business during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023,
the third quarter of our fiscal year 2022 and the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022, respectively) was 481,000 for our fiscal year
2023 and 487,000 for our fiscal year 2022, a decrease of 1.23 . Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales for Company owned restaurants
only was 196,000 and 211,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of 7.11 . Comparable weekly restaurant bar
sales for affiliated limited partnership owned restaurants only was 286,000 and 276,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 respectively,
an increase of 3.62 . We expect that restaurant bar sales for our fiscal year 2024 will increase due to increased restaurant traffic,
Store #25 being open for business for our entire fiscal year 2024 and the opening of our reconstructed restaurant in Hollywood, Florida
(Store #19R) for business during our fiscal year 2024. 

Package Liquor Store Sales . Revenue generated
from sales of liquor and related items at package liquor stores totaled 35,187,000 for our fiscal year 2023 as compared to 31,692,000
for our fiscal year 2022, an increase of 3,495,000. This increase was primarily due to increased package liquor store traffic due to
what appears to be continued increased demand for package liquor store products resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and package liquor
sales generated from the opening of our package liquor store in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) in December 2022 and the opening of our
package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) in March, 2023. The weekly average of same store package liquor store sales, which
includes nine (9) Company-owned package liquor stores, (excluding Store #19P, which was closed for our fiscal year 2022 due to a fire
on October 2, 2018 but re-opened for business during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 and excluding Store #24 which opened for
business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2023), was 631,000 and 609,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 respectively,
an increase of 3.61 . We expect that package liquor store sales for our fiscal year 2024 will increase due to increased package liquor
store traffic and the operation of the package liquor stores located at 7990 Davie Road Extension, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) which
opened for business during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 and located at 11225 Miramar Parkway #245, Miramar, Florida (Store
#24), which opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2023, for the entire fiscal year.

Operating Costs and Expenses . Operating
costs and expenses, (consisting of cost of merchandise sold, payroll and related costs, occupancy costs and selling, general and administrative
expenses), for our fiscal year 2023 increased 16,169,000 or 10.69 to 167,372,000 from 151,203,000 for our fiscal year 2022. The increase
was primarily due to increased payroll, increased consultant fees to improve our accounting process and an expected general increase in
food costs, costs and expenses incurred from the opening of the package liquor stores in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) and Miramar,
Florida (Store #24), during our fiscal year 2023, the opening of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25)
during our fiscal year 2023, and the operation of our Brendan s Sports Pub (Store #30) and limited partnership owned restaurant
in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85) for our entire fiscal year 2023 but only a part of our fiscal year 2022, partially offset by actions taken
by management to reduce and/or control costs. We anticipate that our operating costs and expenses will increase through our fiscal year
2024 primarily due to our package liquor stores in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) and Miramar, Florida (Store #24) being open for business
for our entire fiscal year 2024, our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) being open for business for
our entire fiscal year 2024 and the opening of our reconstructed restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) for business during our
fiscal year 2024. Operating costs and expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue to approximately 95.97 in our fiscal year 2023
from 95.62 in fiscal year 2022. 

Gross Profit .
Gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of merchandise sold from sales. 

Restaurant Food and Bar Sales .
Gross profit for food and bar sales for our fiscal year 2023 increased to 90,750,000 from 79,072,000 for our fiscal year 2022. Our gross
profit margin for restaurant food and bar sales (calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of restaurant food and bar sales),
was 66.61 for our fiscal year 2023 and 63.96 for our fiscal year 2022. Gross profit margin for restaurant food and bar sales increased
during our fiscal year 2023 when compared to our fiscal year 2022 due to decreases in our cost of ribs and the Recent Price Increases,
partially offset by among other things, higher food costs. 

Package Store Sales .
Gross profit for package store sales for our fiscal year 2023 increased to 9,377,000 from 8,382,000 for our fiscal year 2022. Our gross
profit margin, (calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of package liquor store sales), for package store sales was 26.65 
for our fiscal year 2023 and 26.45 for our fiscal year 2022. We anticipate that the gross profit margin for package liquor store merchandise
will remain stable during our fiscal year 2024. 

Payroll and Related Costs .
Payroll and related costs for our fiscal year 2023 increased 6,871,000 or 13.81 to 56,607,000 from 49,736,000 for our fiscal year
2022. Payroll and related costs for our fiscal year 2023 were higher due primarily to the operation of our limited partnership owned
restaurant in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85), and Brendan s Sports Pub (Store #30) during our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed
to a part of our fiscal year 2022 and the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25), the
retail package liquor store in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P), and the retail package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) for
a part of our fiscal year 2023 only and higher salaries to employees to remain competitive with other potential employees in a tight
labor market. Payroll and related costs as a percentage of total revenue was 32.46 for our fiscal year 2023 and 31.45 of total revenue
for our fiscal year 2022. 

Occupancy Costs .
Occupancy costs (consisting of percentage rent, common area maintenance, repairs, real property taxes, amortization of leasehold purchases
and rent expense associated with operating lease liabilities under ASC 842) for our fiscal year 2023 increased 535,000 or 7.61 to 7,566,000
from 7,031,000 for our fiscal year 2022. The increase in occupancy costs was primarily due to the payment of rent for our retail package
liquor store located at 11225 Miramar Parkway, #250, Miramar, Florida (Store #24), our restaurant location located at 11225 Miramar Parkway,
#250, Miramar, Florida (Store #25) and Brendan s Sports Pub (Store #30) during our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part
of our fiscal year 2022. 

Selling, General
and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses (consisting of general corporate expenses, including
but not limited to advertising, insurance, professional costs, clerical and administrative overhead) for our fiscal year 2023 increased
 5,330,000 or 18.29 to 31,901,000 from 26,571,000 for our fiscal year 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased
due primarily to Store #85 and Store #30 being open for our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2022 and
Store #19P, Store #24and Store #25 being open during a part of our fiscal year 2023 only, increased consultant fees to improve our accounting
process, inflation and otherwise to increases in expenses across all categories. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of total revenue will increase during our fiscal year 2024 due primarily to increases across all categories.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue in our fiscal year 2023 to 18.29 as compared
to 16.80 in our fiscal year 2022. 

35 

Depreciation and
Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense for our fiscal year 2023, which is included in selling, general and administrative
expenses, increased 572,000 or 18.99 to 3,584,000 from 3,012,000 from our fiscal year 2022. This increase is driven by the opening
of Stores #19P, #24, and #25. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was 2.06 of revenue for our fiscal
year 2023 and 1.90 of revenue for our fiscal year 2022. 

Interest Expense,
Net . Interest expense, net, for our fiscal year 2023 increased 310,000 to 1,067,000 from 757,000 for our fiscal year 2022.
Interest expense, net, increased for our fiscal year 2023 due to the interest on our borrowing of 8,900,000 from an unrelated third
party lender to re-finance the mortgage loan on our property located at 4 N. Federal Highway, Hallandale Beach, Florida (Store #31) and
due to interest on our borrowing of 1,100,000 from a related third party lender to re-finance the mortgage loan on our property located
at 2600 West Davie Boulevard, Fort Lauderdale, Florida (Store #22) during our fiscal year 2022. 

Income Taxes. Income
tax for our fiscal year 2023 was an expense of 649,000, as compared to an expense of 763,000 for our fiscal year 2022. Income taxes
as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes increased for our fiscal year 2023 (10.70 as compared to our fiscal year
2022 (7.78 ). 

Net Income. Net
income for our fiscal year 2023 decreased 3,633,000 or 40.15 to 5,416,000 from 9,049,000 for our fiscal year 2022 due primarily to
the higher income attributable to the forgiveness of debt of certain of our PPP Loans during our fiscal year 2022, higher food costs and
overall increased expenses during our fiscal year 2023, partially offset by increased revenue at our retail package liquor stores and
restaurants during our fiscal year 2023 and the Recent Price Increases. As a percentage of revenue, net income for our fiscal year 2023
is 3.11 , as compared to 5.72 for our fiscal year 2022. 

Net Income Attributable
to Flanigan s Enterprise, Inc. Stockholders. Net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year 2023 decreased
 2,313,000 or 36.64 to 3,999,000 from 6,312,000 for our fiscal year 2022 due primarily to the higher income attributable to the forgiveness
of debt of certain of our PPP Loans during our fiscal year 2022, higher food costs and overall increased expenses during our fiscal year
2023, and a higher portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (specifically the operations of our Miramar location),
partially offset by increased revenue at our retail package liquor stores and restaurants during our fiscal year 2023 and the Recent Price
Increases. As a percentage of revenue, net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year 2023 is 2.29 , as compared to 3.99 
for our fiscal year 2022. 

New Limited Partnership Restaurants 

As new restaurants open, our income
from operations will be adversely affected due to our obligation to advance pre-opening costs, including but not limited to pre-opening
rent for the new locations. During our fiscal year 2023, we opened one new restaurant location in Miramar, Florida as a Flanigan s . 

Menu Price Increases and Trends 

During the fiscal year 2023, we
increased menu prices for our food offerings (effective March 26, 2023) to target an aggregate increase to our food revenues of approximately
2.06 annually and we increased menu prices for our bar offerings (effective March 20, 2023) to target an increase to our bar revenues
of approximately 5.65 annually to offset higher food and liquor costs and higher overall expenses. During the fiscal year 2022, we increased
menu prices for our food offerings (effective October 3, 2021 and December 19, 2021, respectively) to target an aggregate increase to
our food revenues of approximately 8.83 annually and we increased menu prices for our bar offerings (effective December 12, 2021) to
target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 7.80 annually to offset higher food and liquor costs and higher overall expenses.
Prior to these increases, we previously raised menu prices in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2021. 

COVID-19 has and will continue
to materially and adversely affect our restaurant business for what may be a prolonged period of time. This damage and disruption has
resulted from events and factors that were impossible for us to predict and are beyond our control. As a result, COVID-19 has materially
adversely affected our results of operations for the fiscal year 2023 and will, in all likelihood, impact our results of operations, liquidity,
and/or financial condition throughout our fiscal year 2024. The extent to which our restaurant business may be adversely impacted and
its effect on our operations, liquidity and/or financial condition cannot be accurately predicted. 

Based on current COVID-19 trends,
the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) permitted the federal Public Health Emergency for COVID-19 (PHE) declared by the Secretary
of the Department of Health and Human Services (Secretary) under Section 319 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act to expire at the
end of the day on May 11, 2023.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES 

We fund our operations through
cash from operations and borrowings from third parties. As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 25,532,000,
a decrease of 16,606,000 from our cash balance of 42,138,000 as of October 1, 2022. This decrease is primarily due to our decision not
to finance our insurance premiums for the annual period beginning December 30, 2022 3,281,000), the purchase of properties at Hallandale
Beach, Florida 8,500,000), and El Portal, Florida 3,200,000), and the continued construction of Store #19R 1,308,000). 

During the second quarter of our
fiscal year 2021, certain of the entities owning the limited partnership stores (the LP s ), as well as the store we
manage but do not own (the Managed Store (collectively, the Borrowers ), applied for and received loans from
an unrelated third party lender (the Lender pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP under the
United States Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act enacted March 27, 2020, in the aggregate
principal amount of approximately 3.98 million (the 2 nd PPP Loans ), of which approximately: (i) 3.46 million
was loaned to six (6) of the LP and (ii) 0.52 million was loaned to the Managed Store. During the first quarter of our fiscal
year 2022, we applied for forgiveness for all PPP Loans, including the Managed Store, and as of September 30, 2023, the entire amount
of principal and accrued interest was forgiven under the 2 nd PPP Loans. 

Inflation is affecting all aspects
of our operations, including but not limited to food, beverage, fuel and labor costs. Supply chain issues also contribute to inflation.
Inflation, including supply chain issues are having a material impact on our operating results. 

Notwithstanding the negative effects
of COVID-19 on our operations, we believe that our current cash availability from our cash on hand, positive cash flow from operations
and borrowed funds will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.

In addition to using cash for

and to fund capitalized property improvements for our existing restaurants. During the fiscal year 2023, we acquired property and equipment
and construction in progress of 20,574,000, (including non-cash items which include 2,390,000 of purchase deposits transferred to property
and equipment and 545,000 of purchase deposits transferred to construction in progress and 931,000 of construction in progress in accounts
payable) including 367,000 for renovations to three (3) existing limited partnership owned restaurants and 378,000 for renovations to
three (3) Company owned restaurants. During our fiscal year 2022, we acquired property and equipment of 12,655,000 (of which 3,849,000

and 159,000 for renovations to two (2) Company-owned restaurants. 

37 

Debt 

As of September 30, 2023, we had
long term debt (including the current portion) of 23,128,000, as compared to 25,389,000 as of October 1, 2022. Our long-term debt decreased
as of September 30, 2023 as compared to October 1, 2022 because we satisfied the principal balance and all accrued interest 367,000)
due on our 5.5 million term loan. In addition, we did not finance our insurance premiums for our annual insurance renewal effective December
30, 2022. 

In February 2023, we determined
that as of December 31, 2022, we did not meet the required Post-Distribution Basic Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the Post-Distribution/Fixed
Charge Covenant contained in each of our six (6) loans (the Institutional Loans with our unrelated third-party
institutional lender (the Institutional Lender ). On February 23, 2023, we received from the Institutional Lender, a written
waiver of the non-compliance with the Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant (the Covenant Non-Compliance ), pursuant to
which, among other things, the Institutional Lender waived (1) the non-compliance as of December 31, 2022 and (2) their right to exercise
certain remedies under the Institutional Loans, including the right to accelerate the indebtedness owed by us thereunder, resulting in
the indebtedness under the Institutional Loans to be immediately due and payable, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant requires we maintain a ratio of at least 1.15 to 1.00 and for the twelve
(12) months ended September 30, 2023 our ratio was calculated to be 1.40 to 1.00. We have prepared projections going forward
and expect to be in compliance. As a result, our classification of debt is appropriate as of September 30, 2023. 

We repaid long term debt, including
auto loans, financial insurance premiums, and mortgages in the amount of 2,299,000 and 3,736,000 in our fiscal years 2023 and 2022,
respectively. 

(a) Advance on Existing Mortgage Loan 
 Fort Lauderdale, Florida 

During our fiscal year 2022, we requested and received
a loan advance of 697,000 from an entity controlled by a member of our Board of Directors, which entity currently holds a first priority
mortgage note on our real property and improvements where our restaurant located at 2600 West Davie Boulevard, Fort Lauderdale, Florida
operates (the West Davie Mortgage Note ). Including the 697,000 advance, the principal amount outstanding amount owed under
the West Davie Mortgage Note as of September 30, 2023 is 1,049,000. The West Davie Mortgage Note accrues interest at 6 annually, (increased
from 5 annually), is amortizable over 15 years with monthly installments of principal and interest of approximately 9,300 required to
be made and a final balloon payment of approximately 487,000 required to be made August 1, 2032. 

(b) Re-Finance of Mortgage on Real Property
 Hallandale Beach, Florida 

During our fiscal year 2022, we
re-financed our mortgage debt with our non-affiliated third-party lender secured by our real property located at 4 N. Federal Highway,
Hallandale, Florida where our combination package liquor store and restaurant (Store #31) operates and borrowed an additional 8,012,000
raising the principal balance to 8,900,000, (the 8.90M Mortgage ). The 8.90M Mortgage bears interest at a variable rate
equal to the BSBY Screen Rate 1 Month plus 1.50 . We entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the interest rate risk,
which fixed the interest rate on the 8.90M Mortgage at 4.90 per annum throughout its term. The 8.90M Mortgage is fully amortized over
fifteen (15) years, with our monthly payment of principal and interest totaling 33,000. 

(c Financed Insurance Premiums 

Prior to fiscal year 2023, we
financed our annual insurance premiums. Due to higher interest rates, during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023, for the policy
year commencing December 30, 2022, we paid the premiums for property, general liability, excess liability and terrorist policies, totaling
approximately 3.281 million, in full, which includes coverage for our franchisees (which is 658,000), which are not included in our
consolidated financial statements. Due to continuing higher interest rates for the policy year commencing December 30, 2023, we will pay
the premiums for property, general liability, excess liability, crime and terrorism policies in full 3.932 million), which includes
coverage for our franchises (approximately 786,000). 

We paid the 3.281 million annual
premium amounts on January 9, 2023, which includes coverage for our franchisees which are not included in our consolidated financial
statements. We secured property insurance for the period commencing after the expiration of the current policy on December 30, 2023.
(See Item 2. Subsequent Events for a discussion of property insurance for the period commencing December 30, 2023 on page 31.) 

Construction Contracts 

(a) 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida
(Store #19 Flanigan s 

During the third quarter of our
fiscal year 2019, we entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party architect for design and development services totaling
 77,000 for the re-build of our restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19), which has been closed
since October 2, 2018 due to damages caused by a fire, of which 62,000 has been paid. During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022,
we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor to re-build our restaurant at this location totaling 2,515,000
and during our fiscal year 2023 we agreed to change orders increasing the total contract price by 1,021,000 to 3,536,000, of which 1,534,000
has been paid through September 30, 2023 and 1,090,000 has been paid subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2023. 

38 

(b) 14301 W. Sunrise Boulevard, Sunrise, Florida
(Store #85- "Flanigan's') 

During the second quarter of our
fiscal year 2022, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor for exterior renovations at this location
totaling 343,000 and through the end of our fiscal year 2023 we agreed to change orders to the agreement increasing the total contract
price by 327,000 to 670,000, of which the full amount has been paid as of the end of our fiscal year 2023. 

Purchase Commitments/Supply 

In order to fix the cost and ensure
adequate supply of baby back ribs for our restaurants for calendar years 2023 and 2024, we entered into purchase agreements with our current
rib supplier, whereby we agreed to purchase approximately 7.0 million of 2.25 Down Baby Back Ribs (industry jargon
for the weight range in which slabs of baby back ribs are sold) from this vendor during calendar year 2023, at a prescribed cost, which
we believe is competitive. The increase in our cost of baby back ribs for calendar year 2024 compared to calendar year 2023 is due to
the increase in volume of our purchase of ribs for Store #25, Miramar, Florida being open for the entire calendar year and Store #19,
Hollywood, Florida anticipated to be open for a part of the calendar year, offset by a decrease in market price. 

While we anticipate purchasing
all of our rib supply from this vendor, we believe there are several other alternative vendors available, if needed. 

Flanigan s Fish Company, LLC 

As of September 30, 2023, Flanigan s
Fish Company, LLC, a Florida limited liability company FFC supplies certain of the fish to all of our restaurants. Since
we hold the controlling interest of FFC, the balance sheet and operating results of this entity are consolidated into the accompanying
financial statements of the Company. Sales and purchases of fish are recognized in restaurant food sales and restaurant and lounges (cost
of merchandise sold), respectively, in the consolidated statements of income at the time of sale to the restaurant. In addition, the 49 
of FFC owned by the unrelated third party is recognized as a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements. 

Purchase of Limited Partnership Interests 

During our fiscal year 2023, we
did not purchase any limited partnership interests. During our fiscal year 2022 we purchased 74 limited partnership units (7.4 limited

Working Capital 

The table below summarizes the current assets,
current liabilities, and working capital as of the end of our fiscal years 2023 and 2022.

 Working Capital

 28,717 

Our working capital decreased
as of September 30, 2023 from our working capital as of October 1, 2022 primarily due to increases in (i) cash purchases of real property;
(ii) cash purchases of property and equipment; and (iii) deposits on property and equipment. Current assets as of October 1, 2022 increased
due to our increased borrowings resulting from the Hallandale Mortgage Debt and the West Davie Mortgage Debt, significant portions of
which we classified as long term liabilities as of September 30, 2023. Current assets as of September 30, 2023 decreased due to our decision
not to finance our insurance premiums for the annual period beginning December 30, 2022, as well as the current year investments in the
purchase of property. 

39 

While there can be no assurance
due to, among other things, unanticipated expenses or unanticipated decline in revenues, or both, we believe that our cash on hand, positive
cash flow from operations and borrowed funds will adequately fund operations, debt reductions and planned capital expenditures throughout
our fiscal year 2024. 

During our fiscal year 2024, we
plan to use certain funds on-hand, borrowed funds, and/or insurance proceeds to complete the construction of our new building on the real
property we own located at 2505 N. University Drive Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) where we plan to operate our Flanigan s 
restaurant. There can be no assurance as to the timing for us to complete the construction of the restaurant for Store #19R. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have off-balance sheet
arrangements.

Issued 

The FASB issued guidance, ASU
2022-06 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides
optional expedient and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other
transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. In response to the concerns about structural risks of interbank
offered rates IBORs and, particularly, the risk of cessation of the London interbank offered rate LIBOR ),
regulators in several jurisdictions around the world have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative reference
rates that are more observable or transaction based and less susceptible to manipulation. This accounting standards update provides companies
with optional guidance to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected
to be discontinued. LIBOR rates were published until June 30, 2023. All principal and interest of the Term Loan was paid during the first
quarter of our fiscal year 2023, so the discontinuance of LIBOR rates will have no impact on us. 

The FASB issued guidance, ASU
2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which provides
a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present
the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The measurement of expected credit losses is based
on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts
that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This guidance would be effective for the Company in the first quarter of our fiscal
year 2024; however, after performing a thorough analysis the Company concluded there is no material impact. 

There are no recently issued
accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that we believe will have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies
are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the
related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation
of our consolidated financial statements: 

Estimated Useful Lives of Property and Equipment 

The estimates of useful lives
for property and equipment are significant estimates. Expenditures for the leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is first
constructed are material. In addition, periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material. We estimate the useful
life of those assets by considering, among other things, expected use, life of the lease on the building, and warranty period, if applicable.
The assets are then depreciated using a straight-line method over those estimated lives. These estimated lives are reviewed periodically
and adjusted if necessary. Any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period in which the
adjustment is determined to be necessary. 

40 

Consolidation of Limited Partnerships 

As of September 30, 2023, we operate
ten (10) restaurants as general partner of the limited partnerships that own the operations of these restaurants. We expect that any expansion
which takes place in opening new restaurants will also result in us operating the restaurants as general partner. In addition to the general
partnership interest we also purchased limited partnership units ranging from 0 to 49 of the total units outstanding. As a result of
these controlling interests, we consolidate the operations of these limited partnerships with ours despite the fact that we do not own
in excess of 50 of the equity interests. All intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The non-controlling interests
in the earnings of these limited partnerships are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share. 

Income Taxes 

We account for our income taxes
using FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes , which requires among other things, recognition of future tax benefits measured
at enacted rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities
and tax credits to the extent that realization of said tax benefits is more likely than not. For discussion regarding our carryforwards
refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year 2023. 

Leases 

Effective September 29, 2019,
we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases ASC 842 ), which requires that lease arrangements be presented
on the lessee s balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset and a lease liability equal to the present value of the related
future minimum lease payments. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, using the modified retrospective approach.
This standard had a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income due to the escalations of rent in the extensions but did
not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Estimates associated with leases include lease classification,
discount rate and lease term. 

Loyalty Programs 

We offer loyalty programs to customers
of our restaurants and package liquor stores. The gift cards distributed as a part of our loyalty programs have expiration dates and we
estimate breakage for such gift cards. 

Other Matters 

Impact of Inflation 

The primary inflationary factors affecting our
operations are food, beverage and labor costs. A large number of restaurant personnel are paid at rates based upon applicable minimum
wage and increases in minimum wage directly affect labor costs. Inflation is having a material impact on our operating results, especially
rising food, fuel and labor costs. 

ITEM 7A. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As part of our ongoing operations,
we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings. As more fully described in Note 15 Fair Value Measurements of Financial
Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we use interest rate swap agreements to manage these
risks. These instruments are not used for speculative purposes but are used to modify variable rate obligations into fixed rate obligations. 

At September 30, 2023, we had
one variable rate instrument outstanding that is impacted by changes in interest rates. The interest rate of our variable rate debt instrument
is equal to the lender s BSBY Screen Rate plus one and one-half percent (1.50 per annum. The debt instrument further provides
that the BSBY Screen Rate is a rate of interest equal to the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Interest Rate or successor thereto
approved by the lender. In September 2022, we refinanced the mortgage loan encumbering the property where our combination package liquor
store and restaurant located at 4 N. Federal Highway, Hallandale Beach, Florida, (Store #31) operates, which mortgage loan is held by
an unaffiliated third-party lender (the 8.90M Loan ). 

As a means of managing our interest
rate risk on this debt instrument, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with our unrelated third-party lender to convert this
variable rate debt obligation to a fixed rate. We are currently party to the following interest rate swap agreement: 

41 

(i) The interest rate swap agreement
entered into in September 2022 relates to the 8.90M Loan (the 8.90M Term Loan Swap ). The 8.90M Term Loan Swap requires
us to pay interest for a fifteen (15) year period at a fixed rate of 4.90 on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of 8,900,000,
while receiving interest for the same period at BSBY Screen Rate 1 Month, plus 1.50 , on the same amortizing notional principal
amount. As of September 30, 2023 the fair value of the swap agreement is now reflected on the balance sheet in other assets and accumulated
other comprehensive income. We determined that the interest rate swap agreement is an effective hedging agreement and that changes in
fair value will be adjusted quarterly based on the valuation statement. 

During our fiscal year 2023, we
invested the aggregate sum of 900,000 in 90-day certificates of deposit, fully government guaranteed and at an average fixed annual interest
rate of 4.87 . Otherwise, as on September 30, 2023, our cash resources offset our bank charges and any excess cash resources earn interest
at variable rates. Accordingly, our return on these funds is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. 

There is no assurance that interest
rates will increase or decrease over our next fiscal year or that an increase will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.

ITEM 9A. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES . 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of September 30, 2023, an evaluation
was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2023. 

Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

A material weakness is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our interim or annual financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

During the course of our independent
registered public accounting firm performing its quarterly review procedures in connection with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements to be included in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of our 2023 fiscal year, we became aware of certain errors made by management
in recording certain transactions and in performing debt covenant calculations. As a result of these errors we concluded that we did not
have a sufficient complement of trained and knowledgeable accounting personnel to prevent and detect errors on a timely basis and that
this deficiency constitutes a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. 

During our fiscal year 2023, we
began the process of addressing this material weakness by engaging qualified accounting consultants who have been brought on to enhance,
and continue to enhance, our internal controls over financial reporting. These individuals are licensed CPA s with appropriate levels
of knowledge and experience in public accounting. Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2023, the Company has begun to staff the newly
formed Financial Reporting Division of our Accounting Department. This Department is headed by a Financial Reporting Manager who reports
directly to the CFO. This individual is a qualified CPA with experience in financial reporting and the restaurant industry. The Company
also hired a Senior Accountant to report under this Financial Reporting Manager and has been enlisted with the preparation of various
schedules and entries. We will continue our efforts in our fiscal year 2024 of improving our accounting and finance related processes. 

42 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During the period covered by this
report, we have not made any change to our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Management s Assessment on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
This evaluation was based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission in 2013 COSO ). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that as of September 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
and Permitted Omission from Management s Assessment 

Our internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter
how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls.
Accordingly, even effective internal controls can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

This annual report does not include an attestation
report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report
was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide
only management s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 

Flanigan s Enterprises, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Flanigan s Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022,
the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years
in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In
our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September
30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September
30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising
from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee
and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

 There can be no assurances that we will be
