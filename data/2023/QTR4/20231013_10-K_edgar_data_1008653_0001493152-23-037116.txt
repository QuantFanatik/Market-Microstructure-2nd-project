Our
Business 

Overview 

On
February 16, 2023, the Company entered into the Sale Agreement with Rocitin. Under the terms of the Sale Agreement, the Company has agreed
to purchase 10,000 bottles of Rocitin NMN, a nutritional supplement manufactured by Pharmazeutische Fabrik Evers GmbH Co. KG, a
German company, in which each bottle contains 60 capsules, 10080 mg of NMN, at HK 500 (approximately 64.01) per bottle (the Products ),
with the initial shipment of 2,000 bottles from Rocitin. Except for the payment of the initial shipment of 2,000 bottles of the Products
made on March 1, 2023, the payment of the residual 8,000 bottles of the Products shall be made within 45 days from the date of each invoice
from Rocitin to the Company. Pursuant to the Sale Agreement, Rocitin will deliver the Products to the location specified by the Company
within 15 days of the payment being made. 

On
March 1, 2023, the Company entered the Distributor Agreement with Rocitin. Under the terms of the Distributor Agreement, Rocitin
shall store the Products purchased by the Company from it pursuant to the Sale Agreement in an appropriate warehouse leased by it in
Hong Kong, distribute the Products on a non-exclusive basis, and use its best efforts to promote and maximize the sale of the
Products within Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and China (collectively, the Territory on behalf of the Company, as well as
provide reasonable after-sale support to the purchasers of the Products. In addition, Rocitin shall provide monthly reports to the
Company due by the 15th of each month concerning the Products sales and the marketing activities of the previous
month. 

Pursuant
to the Distributor Agreement, the Company and Rocitin share any gross profit generated by the distribution of the Products on a
50/50 basis; that is, revenue generated from sales of the Products to third parties minus the original purchase price of the Products
paid by the Company to Rocitin, will be shared between the Company and Rocitin on a 50/50 ratio (the Sharing Ratio ). 

As
of June 30, 2023, Rocitin delivered 6,000 bottles of the Products that the Company purchased to the warehouse leased by it in
Hong Kong and distributed and sold approximately 4,952 bottles of the Products in the Territory, in accordance with the Distributor Agreement,
which generated gross revenue of approximately HK 3,327,744 (approximately 424,391). The Company was allocated HK 2,901,872, (approximately
 370,079) from the gross profit, which amount represents the Sharing Ratio, as stipulated in the Distributor Agreement. 

Our
Product 

As
of June 30, 2023, the Company has been selling and distributing one product, Rocitin NMN, to customers in the Territory. Rocitin NMN is a
nutritional supplement manufactured by Pharmazeutische Fabrik Evers GmbH Co. KG, a German company. Each bottle contains 60 capsules,
10080 mg of NMN. 

NMN,
as -Nicotinamide Mononucleotide, exists in some fruits, vegetables, and poultry. It is a molecule naturally occurring in all
life forms and can be transformed into a significant coenzyme NAD+ within cells, which is important to human metabolism. Research,
including but not limited to Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) as an anti-aging health product Promises and safety
concerns, has shown that NAD+ levels in the body will decrease with age, and that exogenous supplementation of NMN
enhances NAD+ levels and thus the function of human cells. For example, NMN helps to convert food energy into cell energy
efficiently to boost energy metabolism and maintain healthy mitochondrial functions. In addition, NMN also helps to repair broken
DNA, regulate the stability of DNA and cell death, and improve neurodegenerative and metabolic conditions. 

5 

Distribution
and Customers 

Under
the terms of the Distributor Agreement, Rocitin shall store the Products purchased by us from it pursuant to the Sale Agreement in
an appropriate warehouse leased by it in Hong Kong, distribute the Products on a non-exclusive basis, and use its best efforts to
promote and maximize the sale of the Products within the Territory on behalf of the Company, as well as provide reasonable after-sale support
to the purchasers of the Products. 

During
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, Rocitin, on our behalf, sold and distributed the Products directly to customers in China through
several cross-border e-commerce platforms such as Xiaohongshu, Douyin, JD.com, and Tmall, and to customers in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan
through its website. We did not cooperate with any distributors and dealers to sell the Products within the Territory during the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2023. 

As
all of our customers were retail customers who directly purchased the Products from us through cross-border e-commerce platforms and
Rocitin s website during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, we did not have any major customers to depend upon. 

Supplier 

As
of June 30, 2023, we have only one supplier, Rocitin. Pursuant to the Sale Agreement with Rocitin, we agreed to purchase 10,000
bottles of the Products. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, we purchased 6,000 bottles of the Products from Rocitin. As our
business is still at the beginning stage and under our evaluation, we do not intend to enter into a continuous or long-term supply
agreement with Rocitin until we fulfill our obligation under the Sale Agreement to purchase 10,000 bottles of the Products. We
believe not being bound by a continuous or long-term supply agreement can allow us to maintain flexibility regarding choosing our
supplier and determining whether to further develop the current business operation or seek other prospective new business
opportunities. 

For
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, Rocitin directly sourced the Products from Pharmazeutische Fabrik Evers GmbH Co. KG, a German
company that manufactures the Products Fabrik Evers GmbH ). While Fabrik Evers GmbH is the only source of the Products,
neither Rocitin nor the Company intend to enter a long-term supply agreement with it, since we can generally find similar replacements
in the market from the competitors of Fabrik Evers GmbH. 

Our
Strategy 

As
the Company intends to further develop the preceding business operation, its management also continues to seek other prospective new
business opportunities. 

The
Company s management has substantial flexibility in identifying and selecting prospective new business opportunities. The Company
is dependent on the judgment of its management in connection with this process. In evaluating a prospective business opportunity, we
would consider, among other factors, the following: 

costs
 associated with pursuing a new business opportunity; 

growth
 potential of the new business opportunity; 

experiences,
 skills and availability of additional personnel necessary to pursue a potential new business opportunity; 

necessary
 capital requirements; 

the
 competitive position of the new business opportunity; 

stage
 of business development; 

the
 market acceptance of the potential products and services; 

proprietary
 features and degree of intellectual property; and 

the
 regulatory environment that may be applicable to any prospective business opportunity. 

6 

The
foregoing criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and there may be other criteria that management may deem relevant. In connection
with an evaluation of a prospective or potential business opportunity, management may be expected to conduct a due diligence review. 

The
time and costs required to pursue new business opportunities, which includes negotiating and documenting relevant agreements and preparing
requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable securities laws, cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty. In addition,
the global COVID-19 pandemic has created significant challenges for us to research potential targets and any target business with which we
ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Management
intends to devote such time as it deems necessary to carry out the Company s affairs. The exact length of time required for the
pursuit of any new potential business opportunities is uncertain. No assurance can be made that we will be successful in our efforts.
We cannot project the amount of time that our management will actually devote to the Company s plan of operation. 

The
Company intends to conduct its activities so as to avoid being classified as an Investment Company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, and therefore avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 

Intellectual
Property 

As
of June 30, 2023, we do not have, and are not applying for, any intellectual properties. 

Government
Approval 

As
of June 30, 2023, we do not need any approval from any applicable government to sell the Products in the Territory. 

Governmental
 Environmental Regulations 

As
of June 30, 2023, we are subject to certain import regulations and administrative requirements of the governments in the Territory. We
have been complying with all applicable regulations and administrative requirements to import the Products. Expenditures for compliance
with applicable regulations and administrative requirements to import the Products have not had, and are not expected to have, a material
effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position. 

As
of June 30, 2023, we are not subjected to any specific environmental regulations for selling and distributing the Products in the Territory. 

Competition 

Due
to the low barriers to entering the market of selling NMN products in the Territory, we compete with many distributors who sell NMN products
similar to ours, especially in China and Hong Kong. Many of these distributors are more established than we are and have significantly
greater financial, technical, and other resources than we presently possess. Some of our competitors may be able to respond more quickly
to new opportunities, market changes or changes in customer preferences, and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities
and adopt more aggressive pricing strategies than we are. Despite the above and the fact that we have yet to develop certain competitive
advantages, as our business is still at the beginning stage, we believe we will have the potential to compete by making the most of our
flexibility to select suppliers and manufacturers who are able to provide the Products with good quality and lower cost. 

7 

Employees 

Mr.
Raymond Chen, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is our sole executive officer. Mr. Chen devotes his full time
to administering the Company s business operations and other affairs. As we further develop our business, we intend to hire additional
persons on an as-needed basis. 

Legal
Proceedings 

There
is no material litigation, arbitration, governmental proceeding or any other legal proceeding currently pending or known to be contemplated
against us or any member of our management team in their capacity as such, and we and the member of our management team have not been
subject to any such proceeding in the 10 years preceding the date of this report. We may however be involved, from time to time, in claims
and lawsuits incidental to the conduct of our business in the ordinary course. We carry insurance coverage in such amounts as we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances and that may or may not cover any or all of our liabilities in respect of these matters. We
do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position,
cash flows or results of operations, but cannot guarantee same.

future and this arrangement will remain until we find a new business opportunity. 

ITEM
3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We
are not currently involved in any material legal proceedings. From time-to-time we are, and we anticipate that we may be,
involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business and otherwise. The ultimate costs
to resolve any such matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. We could be forced to incur material expenses
with respect to these legal proceedings, and in the event that there is an outcome in any that is adverse to us, our financial position
and prospects could be harmed.

Overview 

On
February 16, 2023, the Company entered into the Sale Agreement with Rocitin. Under the terms of the Sale Agreement, the Company has agreed
to purchase 10,000 bottles of Rocitin NMN, a nutritional supplement manufactured by Pharmazeutische Fabrik Evers GmbH Co. KG, a
German company, in which each bottle contains 60 capsules, 10080 mg of NMN, at HK 500 (approximately 64.01) per bottle (the Products ),
with the initial shipment of 2,000 bottles from Rocitin. Except for the payment of the initial shipment of 2,000 bottles of the Products
made on March 1, 2023, the payment of the residual 8,000 bottles of the Products shall be made within 45 days from the date of each invoice
from Rocitin to the Company. Pursuant to the Sale Agreement, Rocitin will deliver the Products to the location specified by the Company
within 15 days of the payment being made. 

On
March 1, 2023, the Company entered the Distributor Agreement with Rocitin. Under the terms of the Distributor Agreement, Rocitin
shall store the Products purchased by the Company from it pursuant to the Sale Agreement in an appropriate warehouse leased by it in
Hong Kong, distribute the Products on a non-exclusive basis, and use its best efforts to promote and maximize the sale of the
Products within Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and China (collectively, the Territory on behalf of the Company, as well as
provide reasonable after-sale support to the purchasers of the Products. In addition, Rocitin shall provide monthly reports to the
Company due by the 15th of each month concerning the Products sales and the marketing activities of the previous
month. 

Pursuant
to the Distributor Agreement, the Company and Rocitin shall share any gross profit generated by the distribution of the Products on a
50/50 basis; that is, revenue generated from sales of the Products to third parties minus the original purchase price of the Products
paid by the Company to Rocitin, will be shared between the Company and Rocitin on a 50/50 ratio (the Sharing Ratio ). 

As
of June 30, 2023, Rocitin delivered 6,000 bottles of the Products that the Company purchased to the warehouse leased by it in
Hong Kong and distributed and sold approximately 4,952 bottles of the Products in the Territory, in accordance with the Distributor Agreement,
which generated gross revenue of approximately HK 3,327,744 (approximately 424,391). The Company was allocated HK 2,901,872, (approximately
 370,079) from the gross profit, which amount represents the Sharing Ratio, as stipulated in the Distributor Agreement 

As
the Company intends to further develop the preceding business operation, its management also continues to seek other prospective new
business opportunities. 

The
Company s management has substantial flexibility in identifying and selecting prospective new business opportunities. The Company
is dependent on the judgment of its management in connection with this process. In evaluating a prospective business opportunity, we
would consider, among other factors, the following: 

costs
 associated with pursuing a new business opportunity; 

growth
 potential of the new business opportunity; 

experiences,
 skills and availability of additional personnel necessary to pursue a potential new business opportunity; 

necessary
 capital requirements; 

the
 competitive position of the new business opportunity; 

stage
 of business development; 

the
 market acceptance of the potential products and services; 

proprietary
 features and degree of intellectual property; and 

the
 regulatory environment that may be applicable to any prospective business opportunity. 

The
foregoing criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and there may be other criteria that management may deem relevant. In connection
with an evaluation of a prospective or potential business opportunity, management may be expected to conduct a due diligence review. 

The
time and costs required to pursue new business opportunities, which includes negotiating and documenting relevant agreements and preparing
requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable securities laws, cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty. In addition,
the global COVID-19 pandemic has created significant challenges for us to research potential targets and any target business with which we
ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

10 

Management
intends to devote such time as it deems necessary to carry out the Company s affairs. The exact length of time required for the
pursuit of any new potential business opportunities is uncertain. No assurance can be made that we will be successful in our efforts.
We cannot project the amount of time that our management will actually devote to the Company s plan of operation. 

The
Company intends to conduct its activities so as to avoid being classified as an Investment Company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, and therefore avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 and the regulations promulgated thereunder 

Results
of Operations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 

We
have generated 424,391 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and did not generate any revenues during the fiscal year 2022. We
had total operating expenses of 176,512, including general and administrative expenses of 122,200, and sales expenses of 54,312
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, compared to 105,448, including 105,448 general and administrative expenses during the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. We incurred interest expenses of 22,188 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, compared to
interest expenses of 9,158 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. During the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, we had a net
loss of 89,920 and 114,605, respectively, mainly due to the change in company s revenue in 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
Company has recently commenced its business operation and has limited cash resources other than
advances provided by our majority shareholder or an affiliated party. We are dependent upon interim funding provided by our majority
shareholder or an affiliated party to pay operating expenses and professional fees and expenses. Our majority shareholder and an affiliated
party have agreed to provide funding as may be required to pay for accounting fees and other administrative expenses of the Company until
such time the Company generates sufficient profits to pay these fees. The Company would be unable to continue as a going concern without
interim financing provided by our majority shareholder and our affiliated party. 

If
we require additional financing, we cannot predict whether equity or debt financing will become available at terms acceptable to us,
if at all. The Company depends upon services provided by management and funding provided by our majority shareholder or our affiliated
party to fulfill its filing obligations under the Exchange Act. At present, the Company has limited financial resources to pay for such
services. 

The
following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented:

Net
cash used in our operating activities was 206,807 and 124,871 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The
increase of 81,936 was due mainly to a 81,936 increase in operating assets. 

Our
financing activities generated a cash inflow of 206,807 and 124,871 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively,
due to the funds borrowed from our majority shareholder and an affiliated party and a loan from the lender (described below). 

During
the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs related to: 

filing
 of Exchange Act reports, 

the
 current business operation, 

registered
 agent fees and accounting fees, and 

investigating,
 analyzing and consummating an acquisition or business combination. 

As
of June 30, 2023, we had current assets of 168,506, and on June 30, 2022, we had no current assets. As of June 30, 2023, we had 466,116
in liabilities, consisting of accounts payable of 17,422, an advance from a related party of 415,601, accrued interest due to related
parties of 7,812 in one loan agreement, and accrued expenses of 25,280. As of June 30, 2022, we had 207,690 in liabilities consisting
of accounts payable of 3,250, an advance from a related party of 191,091, accrued interest due to related parties of 3,329 in one
loan agreement, and accrued expenses of 10,020. 

11 

During
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, we had negative cash flow from operating activities of 206,807, due to a net loss of 89,920, and
a change in operating assets. We financed our negative cash flow from operations and 206,807 in advances from New York Listing Management,
Inc, an affiliated party. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, we had negative cash flow from operating activities of 124,871,
mainly due to a net loss of 114,605 offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 10,266. We financed our negative
cash flow from operations and 124,871 in advances from New York Listing Management, Inc, an affiliated party. 

The
Company currently plans to satisfy its cash requirements for the next 12 months through borrowings from New York Listing Management,
Inc, as well as from the revenue generated from operations, and believes it can satisfy its cash requirements so long as it is able to
obtain such financing from New York Listing Management, Inc and the current business operation continues successfully. The Company expects
that money borrowed and generated from such sources will be used during the next 12 months to satisfy the Company s operating costs,
professional fees and general corporate purposes. 

On
March 31, 2021, we entered into a loan agreement with New York Listing Management, Inc, a related party, under which we are able to receive
funding of up to 200,000 for general operating expenses from time-to-time as needed by the Company (the NYLM Loan Agreement ).
The NYLM Loan Agreement bears an interest rate of 8 per annum and is due and payable on the date that is three hundred sixty-six (366)
days from the date of such loan agreement. On March 31, 2022, we extended the NYLM Loan Agreement with New York Listing Management, Inc
and such loan agreement was to mature on March 31, 2023. On April 1, 2023, we re-signed the NYLM Loan Agreement with New York Listing
Management, Inc, and the loan agreement has no expiration, is due on demand, and the borrowing limit has been increased
to 800,000. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the outstanding balance on this loan was 415,601 and 191,091, respectively, with accrued
interest of 7,812 and 3,329, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, we expensed interest of 22,188, related to the NYLM Loan Agreement. 

The
Company intends to repay the loan from New York Listing Management, Inc at a time when it has the cash resources to do so. 

The
Company has only limited capital. Additional financing is necessary for the Company to continue as a going concern. Our independent auditors
issued an unqualified audit opinion for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 with an explanatory paragraph expressing uncertainty as to the Company s ability to remain as a going concern. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of June 30, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated
under the Securities Act of 1934.

9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

Effective
as of April 27, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the engagement of Qi CPA LLC Qi to serve as the
Company s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and quarterly periods ended March
31, 2023, September 30, 2023, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. 

12 

During
the two fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the subsequent interim period through April 26, 2023, neither the Company nor
anyone acting on its behalf has consulted with Qi with respect to (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified
transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company s financial
statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to us by Qi that was an important factor considered by us in
reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue, or (ii) any other matter that was the subject of a
disagreement as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K or a
reportable event as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 

On
April 27, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company notified M K CPAS, PLLC (the Former Auditor that the Former
Auditor was dismissed as the Company s independent registered public accounting firm. The decision to dismiss the Former
Auditor was approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. 

The
reports of the Former Auditor on the Company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30,
2022 and 2021 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit
scope or accounting principle. 

During
fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the subsequent interim period through April 26, 2023, there were no disagreements as
described under Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K with the Former Auditor on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the Former Auditor s
satisfaction, would have caused the Former Auditor to make reference to the subject matter thereof in connection with its reports on
the financial statements of the Company for such years. In addition, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the
subsequent interim period through April 26, 2023, there were no reportable events as described under Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation
S-K. 

The
Former Auditor furnished a letter addressed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stating it agrees with the above
statements. A copy of the Former Auditor s letter, dated May 2, 2023, was attached as Exhibit 16.1 of Form 8-k the Company
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 2, 2023. 

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of June 30, 2023, the Company s Chief Executive Officer conducted an evaluation regarding the effectiveness of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon the evaluation of these
controls and procedures as provided under the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (2013), our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
ineffective because of the identification of material weaknesses, including lack of sufficient internal accounting personnel in order
to ensure complete documentation of complex transactions and adequate financial reporting during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.
The Company has no formal control process related to the identification and approval of related party transactions. As a company that
has just commenced its business operation, the Company currently has limited personnel, and, as of the date of this report, it has not
taken corrective actions to address the ineffective disclosure controls and procedures. The Company intends to take corrective actions
in the future when it generates sufficient profits to do so. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange
Act as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation
and fair presentation of published financial statements. Management conducted an assessment of the Company s internal control over
financial reporting as of June 30, 2023 based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). 

13 

Based
on our assessment and those criteria, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective because of
the identification of material weaknesses, including lack of sufficient internal accounting personnel in order to ensure complete documentation
of complex transactions and adequate financial reporting during the year ended June 30, 2023. The Company has no formal control process
related to the identification and approval of related party transactions. As a company that has just commenced its business operation,
the Company currently has limited personnel, and, as of the date of this report, it has not taken corrective actions to address the ineffective
disclosure controls and procedures. The Company intends to take corrective actions in the future when it generates sufficient profits
to do so. 

Our
management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors identified in connection with the evaluation required
by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 

 of Ecomax, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of
Ecomax, Inc. (the Company as of June 30, 2023 and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficiency,
and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In
our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ecomax, Inc. as of June 30,
2023 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Going Concern Uncertainty 

The accompanying financial statements referred to
above have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements,
the Company s present financial situation raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to this matter are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are
matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Revenue Recognition Refer to Note 2 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

Revenue recognition was identified as the critical
audit matter due to fiscal year 2023 was the first year the Company began make sales since inception and it is the first time the Company

years. Expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized. Expenditures for minor items, repairs
and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. Gain or loss upon sale or retirement due to obsolescence is reflected in the operating
results in the period the event takes place. 

Our
revenue (referred to in our financial statements as Sales consists primarily of the sale of Rocitin NMN products for cash
or otherwise agreed-upon credit terms. Our customers consist primarily of wholesalers. Our revenue generating activities have a single
performance obligation and are recognized at the point in time when control transfers and our obligation has been fulfilled, which is
when the related goods are shipped or delivered to the customer, depending upon the method of distribution, and shipping terms. We have
elected to treat shipping as a fulfillment activity. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange
for the sale of our product. The Company has no obligation to accept the return of products sold other than for replacement of damaged
products. Other than quantity price discounts negotiated with customers prior to billing and delivery (which are reflected as a reduction
in sales), the Company does not offer any sales incentives or other rebate arrangements to customers. 

Management
will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax asset and its related valuation allowance. If our assessment of the deferred
tax assets or the corresponding valuation allowance were to change, we would record the related adjustment to income during the period
in which we make the determination. Our tax rate may also vary based on our results and the mix of income or loss in domestic and foreign
tax jurisdictions in which we operate. 

In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We
recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and
to the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we will
reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary.
We will record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is
less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be. 

ASC
740 which requires recognition of estimated income taxes payable or refundable on income tax returns for the current year and for the
estimated future tax effect attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards. Measurement of deferred income tax is based on
enacted tax laws including tax rates, with the measurement of deferred income tax assets being reduced by available tax benefits not
expected to be realized. 

. For the
years ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, the Company had losses of 
and ,
respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a
reasonable period of time. The future of the Company is dependent upon management s success in its efforts and limited
resources to conduct the Company s current business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the
recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Currently,
the Company obtain capital from a significant shareholder to meet its minimal operating expenses. If the current single business model
is not successful, we do not believe that we could succeed in raising additional capital from unrelated parties or to sustain our operations
without some strategic transaction, such as a business combination or merger. If we are unable to generate enough revenues to cover the
costs of operation, we expect that we would need to either continue to borrow funds from related party, or cease all operations and wind
down. Although we are currently evaluating our strategic alternatives with respect to all aspects of our business, we cannot assure you
that any actions that we take would raise or generate sufficient capital to fully address the uncertainties of our financial position.

not materialize and have provided a valuation allowance against substantially all our net deferred tax asset.

officers or other principal financial officers may be granted only by our Board of Directors or the appropriate committee of our Board
of Directors and will be disclosed to the public as required by law or the rules of Nasdaq. 

CONFLICTS
OF INTEREST 

Identifying
Potential Conflicts of Interest 

A
conflict of interest may occur when an employee s private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of the
Company as a whole. You should avoid any private interest that influences your ability to act in the interests of the Company or that
makes it difficult to perform your work objectively and effectively. 

Identifying
potential conflicts of interest may not always be clear-cut. The following situations are examples of conflicts of interest: 

Outside
 Employment . No employee should be employed by, serve as a director of, or provide any services not in his or her capacity as
 a Company s employee to a company that is a material customer, supplier, or competitor of the Company. 

Improper
 Personal Benefits . No employee should obtain any material (as to him or her) personal benefits or favors because of his or her
 position in the Company. Please see Gifts and Entertainment below for additional guidelines in this area. 

Financial
 Interests . No employee should have a significant financial interest (ownership or otherwise) in any company that is a material
 customer, supplier or competitor of the Company. A significant financial interest means (i) ownership of greater than
 1 of the equity of a material customer, supplier or competitor or (ii) an investment in a material customer, supplier or competitor
 that represents more than 5 of the total assets of the employee. 

Loans
 or Other Financial Transactions . No employee should obtain loans or guarantees of personal obligations from, or enter into any
 other personal financial transaction with, any company that is a material customer, supplier or competitor of the Company. This guideline
 does not prohibit arms-length transactions with banks, brokerage firms or other financial institutions. 

Service
 on Boards and Committees . No employee should serve on a board of directors or trustees or on a committee of any entity (whether
 profit or not-for-profit) whose interests would reasonably be expected to be in conflict with those of the Company. 

Actions
 of Family Members . The actions of family members outside the workplace may also give rise to the conflicts of interest described
 above because they may influence an employee s objectivity in the making of decisions on behalf of the Company. For the purposes
 of this Code, family members include your spouse or life-partner, brothers, sisters and parents, in-laws and
 children, whether such relationships are by blood or adoption. 

For
the purposes of this Code, a company is considered to be a material customer if that company has made payments to the Company
in the past year in excess of US 100,000 or 10 of the customer s gross revenues, whichever is greater. A company is considered
as a material supplier if that company has received payments from the Company in the past year in excess of US 100,000
or 10 of the supplier s gross revenues, whichever is greater. A company is considered as a material competitor if
that company competes in the Company s line of business and has annual gross revenues from such line of business in excess of US 500,000.
If you are uncertain whether a particular company is a material customer, supplier or competitor, please contact the Compliance Officer
for assistance. 

2 

Disclosure
of Conflicts of Interest 

The
Company requires employees to disclose any situations that would reasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest. If you
suspect that you have a conflict of interest, or something that others could reasonably perceive as a conflict of interest, you must
report it to your supervisor or the Compliance Officer. Your supervisor and the Compliance Officer will work with you to determine whether
you have a conflict of interest and, if so, how best to address it. Although conflicts of interest are not automatically prohibited,
they are not desirable and may only be waived as described in Waivers of the Code above. 

CORPORATE
OPPORTUNITIES 

As
an employee of the Company, you have an obligation to advance the Company s interests when the opportunity to do so arises. If
you discover or are presented with a business opportunity through the use of corporate property, information, or because of your position
in the Company, you should first present the business opportunity to the Company before pursuing the opportunity in your individual capacity.
No employee may use corporate property, information, or his or her position in the Company for personal gain or in a manner that may
compete with the Company. 

You
should disclose to your supervisor the terms and conditions of each business opportunity covered under this Code that you wish to pursue.
Your supervisor will contact the Compliance Officer and the appropriate management personnel to determine whether the Company wishes
to pursue the business opportunity. If the Company waives its right to pursue the business opportunity, you may pursue the business opportunity
on the same terms and conditions as originally proposed and consistent with the other ethical guidelines set forth in this Code. 

Confidential
Information and Company s Property 

Employees
have access to a variety of confidential information while being employed at the Company. Confidential information includes all non-public
information that might be of use to competitors, or, if disclosed, harmful to the Company or its customers. Each employee has a duty
to respect and safeguard the confidentiality of the Company s information and the information of our suppliers and customers, except
when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated. In addition, you must refrain from using any confidential information from any previous
employment if, in doing so, you could reasonably be expected to breach your duty of confidentiality to your former employers. An employee s
obligation to protect confidential information continues after he or she leaves the Company. Unauthorized disclosure of confidential
information could cause competitive harm to the Company and/or its customers and could result in legal liability to you and the Company. 

Employees
also have a duty to protect the Company s intellectual property and other business assets. The intellectual property, business
systems and the security of the Company are critical to the Company s business. 

Any
questions or concerns on whether the disclosure of Company information is legally mandated should be promptly referred to the Compliance
Officer. 

Safeguarding
Confidential Information and Company s Property 

Care
must be taken to safeguard and protect confidential information and the Company s property. Accordingly, the following measures
should be adhered to: 

The
 Company s employees should conduct their business and social activities so as not to risk inadvertent disclosure of confidential
 information. For example, when not in use, confidential information should be securely stored. Besides, review of confidential documents
 or discussion of confidential subjects in public places (e.g., airplanes, trains, taxis, buses, etc.) should not be conducted so
 as to prevent being overheard or accessed by unauthorized persons. 

When
 in the Company s offices, confidential matters should not be discussed within hearing range of visitors or others not working
 on such matters. 

Confidential
 matters should not be discussed with other employees not working on such matters or with friends or relatives, including those living
 in the same household as a Company s employee. 

The
 Company s employees are only to access, use, and disclose confidential information that is necessary for them to perform their
 duties. They are not to disclose confidential information to other employees or contractors at the Company unless it is necessary
 for those employees or contractors to have such confidential information in the course of their duties. 

3 

The
 Company s files, personal computers, networks, software, internet access, internet browser programs, emails, voice mails, and
 other business equipment (e.g., desks and cabinets) and resources are provided for business use, and they are the exclusive property
 of the Company. Misuse of such Company s property is not tolerable. 

COMPETITION
AND FAIR DEALING 

All
employees are obligated to deal fairly with fellow employees and with the Company s customers, suppliers and competitors. Employees
should not take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material
facts, or any other unfair-dealing practice. 

Relationships
with Customers 

Our
business success depends upon our ability to foster lasting customer relationships. The Company is committed to dealing with customers
fairly, honestly, and with integrity. Specifically, you should keep the following guidelines in mind when dealing with customers: 

Information
 we supply to customers should be accurate and complete to the best of our knowledge. Employees should not deliberately misrepresent
 information to customers. 

Employees
 should not refuse to sell, service, or maintain products the Company has produced simply because a customer is buying products from
 another supplier. 

Customer
 entertainment should not exceed the reasonable and customary business practice of the Company. Employees should not provide entertainment
 or other benefits that could be viewed as an inducement to or a reward for customer s purchase decisions. Please see Gifts
 and Entertainment below for additional guidelines in this area. 

Relationships
with Suppliers 

The
Company deals fairly and honestly with its suppliers. This means that our relationships with suppliers are based on price, quality, service,
and reputation, among other factors. Employees dealing with suppliers should carefully guard their objectivity. Specifically, no employee
should accept or solicit any personal benefit from a supplier or potential supplier that might compromise, or appear to compromise, their
objective assessment of the supplier s products and prices. Employees can give or accept promotional items of nominal value or
moderately scaled entertainment within the limits of reasonable and customary business practice of the Company. Please see Gifts
and Entertainment below for additional guidelines in this area. 

Relationships
with Competitors 

The
Company is committed to free and open competition in the marketplace. Employees should avoid actions that would be contrary to laws governing
competitive practices in the marketplace, including antitrust laws. Such actions include misappropriation and/or misuse of a competitor s
confidential information or making false statements about the competitor s business and business practices. 

PROTECTION
AND USE OF COMPANY S ASSETS 

Employees
should protect the Company s assets and ensure their efficient use for legitimate business purposes only. Theft, carelessness and
waste have a direct impact on the Company s profitability. The use of Company funds or assets, whether or not for personal gain,
for any unlawful or improper purpose is prohibited. 

To
ensure the protection and proper use of the Company s assets, each employee should: 

exercise
 reasonable care to prevent theft, damage or misuse of Company s property; 

report
 the actual or suspected theft, damage or misuse of Company s property to a supervisor; 

4 

use
 the Company s telephone system, other electronic communication services, written materials and other property primarily for
 business-related purposes; 

safeguard
 all electronic programs, data, communications and written materials from inadvertent access by others; and 

use
 Company s property only for legitimate business purposes, as authorized in connection with your job responsibilities. 

Employees
should be aware that Company s property includes all data and communications transmitted or received to or by, or contained in,
the Company s electronic or telephonic systems, as well as all written communications. Employees and other users of Company s
property should have no expectation of privacy with respect to these communications and data. To the extent permitted by law, the Company
has the ability, and reserves the right, to monitor all electronic and telephonic communication. These communications may also be subject
to disclosure to law enforcement or government officials. 

GIFTS
AND ENTERTAINMENT 

The
act of giving and receiving of gifts is a common business practice. Appropriate business gifts and entertainment are welcome courtesies
designed to build relationships and understanding among business partners. However, gifts and entertainment should not compromise, or
appear to compromise, your ability to make objective and fair business decisions. 

It
is your responsibility to use good judgment in this area. As a general rule, you may give or receive gifts or entertainment to or from
customers or suppliers only if the gift or entertainment would not be viewed as an inducement to or reward for any particular business
decision. All gifts and entertainment expenses should be properly accounted for on expense reports. The following specific examples may
be helpful: 

Meals
 and Entertainment . You may occasionally accept or give meals, refreshments or other entertainment if: 

The
 items are of reasonable value; 

The
 purpose of the meeting or attendance at the event is business related; and 

The
 expenses would be paid by the Company as a reasonable business expense if not paid for by another party. 

Entertainment
of reasonable value may include food and tickets for sporting and cultural events if they are generally offered to other customers, suppliers
or vendors. 

Advertising
 and Promotional Materials . You may occasionally accept or give advertising or promotional materials of nominal value. 

Personal
 Gifts . You may accept or give personal gifts of reasonable value that are related to recognized special occasions, such as a
 graduation, promotion, new job, wedding, retirement or a holiday. A gift is also acceptable if it is based on a family or personal
 relationship and unrelated to the business involved between the individuals. 

Gifts
 Rewarding Service or Accomplishment . You may accept a gift from a civic, charitable or religious organization specifically related
 to your service or accomplishment. 

You
must be particularly careful that gifts and entertainment are not construed as bribes, kickbacks, or other improper payments. See The
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act below for a more detailed discussion of our policies on giving or receiving gifts related to business
transactions. 

You
should make every effort to refuse or return a gift that is beyond these permissible guidelines. If it would be inappropriate to refuse
a gift or you are unable to return a gift, you should promptly report the gift to your supervisor. Your supervisor will bring the gift
to the attention of the Compliance Officer, who may require you to donate the gift to an appropriate community organization. If you have
any questions on whether it is permissible to accept a gift or something else of value, contact your supervisor or the Compliance Officer
for additional guidance. 

5 

COMPANY
RECORDS 

Accurate
and reliable records are crucial to our business. Our records are the basis of our earnings statements, financial reports and other disclosures
to the public and guide our business decision-making and strategic planning. Company records include booking information, payroll, timecards,
travel and expense reports, e-mails, accounting and financial data, measurement and performance records, electronic data files and all
other records maintained in the ordinary course of our business. 

All
Company records must be complete, accurate and reliable in all material respects. Undisclosed or unrecorded funds, payments or receipts
are inconsistent with our business practices and are prohibited. You are responsible for understanding and complying with our record-keeping
policy. Ask your supervisor if you have any questions. 

ACCURACY
OF FINANCIAL REPORTS AND OTHER PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS 

As
a public company we are subject to various securities laws, regulations and reporting obligations. These laws, regulations and obligations
and our policies require the disclosure of accurate and complete information regarding the Company s business, financial condition
and results of operations. Inaccurate, incomplete or untimely reporting will not be tolerated and can severely damage the Company s
reputation and integrity, and result in legal liability. 

It
is essential that the Company s financial records, including all filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC be accurate and timely. Accordingly, in addition to adhering to the conflict of interest policy and other policies and guidelines under
this Code, the principal financial officers and other senior financial officers must take special care to exhibit integrity at all times
and to instill this value within their organizations. In particular, these senior officers must ensure their conduct is honest and ethical
that they abide by all public disclosure requirements by providing full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosures, and that
they comply with all other applicable laws and regulations. These financial officers must also understand and strictly comply with generally
accepted accounting principles in the U.S. and all standards, laws and regulations for accounting and financial reporting of transactions,
estimates and forecasts. 

In
addition, U.S. federal securities law requires the Company to maintain proper internal books and records and to devise and maintain an
adequate system of internal accounting controls. The SEC has supplemented the statutory requirements by adopting rules that prohibit
(1) any person from falsifying records or accounts subject to the above requirements and (2) officers or directors from making any materially
false, misleading, or incomplete statement to an accountant in connection with an audit or any filing with the SEC. These provisions
reflect the SEC s intent to discourage officers, directors, and other persons with access to the Company s books and records
from taking action that might result in the communication of materially misleading financial information to the investing public. 

COMPLIANCE
WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS 

Each
employee has an obligation to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company s operations. These include,
without limitation, laws covering bribery and kickbacks, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, information privacy, insider trading,
illegal political contributions, antitrust prohibitions, foreign corrupt practices, offering or receiving gratuities, environmental hazards,
employment discrimination or harassment, occupational health and safety, false or misleading financial information or misuse of corporate
assets. You are expected to understand and comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to your job position. If any doubt
exists about whether a course of action is lawful, you should seek advice from your supervisor or the Compliance Officer. 

COMPLIANCE
WITH INSIDER TRADING LAWS 

The
Company has an insider trading policy, which may be obtained from the Compliance Officer. The following is a summary of some of the general
principles relevant to insider trading, and should be read in conjunction with the aforementioned specific policy. 

6 

Company
employees are prohibited from trading in shares or other securities of the Company while in possession of material, non-public information
about the Company. In addition, Company employees are prohibited from recommending, tipping or suggesting that anyone else
buy or sell shares or other securities of the Company on the basis of material, non-public information. Company employees who obtain
material non-public information about another company in the course of their employment are prohibited from trading in shares or securities
of the other company while in possession of such information or tipping others to trade on the basis of such information.
Violation of insider trading laws can result in severe fines and criminal penalties, as well as disciplinary action by the Company, up
to and including termination of employment. 

Information
is non-public if it has not been made generally available to the public by means of a press release or other means of widespread
distribution. Information is material if a reasonable investor would consider it important in a decision to buy, hold or
sell stock or other securities. As a rule of thumb, any information that would affect the value of stock or other securities should be
considered material. Examples of information that is generally considered material include: 

Financial
 results or forecasts, or any information that indicates the Company s financial results may exceed or fall short of forecasts
 or expectations; 

Important
 new products or services; 

Pending
 or contemplated acquisitions or dispositions, including mergers, tender offers or joint venture proposals; 

Possible
 management changes or changes of control; 

Pending
 or contemplated public or private sales of debt or equity securities; 

Acquisition
 or loss of a significant customer or contract; 

Significant
 write-offs; 

Initiation
 or settlement of significant litigation; and 

Changes
 in the Company s auditors or a notification from its auditors that the Company may no longer rely on the auditor s report. 

The
laws against insider trading are specific and complex. Any questions about information you may possess or about any dealings you have
had in the Company s securities should be promptly brought to the attention of the Compliance Officer. 

PUBLIC
COMMUNICATIONS AND PREVENTION OF SELECTIVE DISCLOSURE 

Public
Communications Generally 

The
Company places a high value on its credibility and reputation in the community. What is written or said about the Company in the news
media and investment community directly impacts our reputation, positively or negatively. Our policy is to provide timely, accurate and
complete information in response to public requests (media, analysts, etc.), consistent with our obligations to maintain the confidentiality
of competitive and proprietary information and to prevent selective disclosure of market-sensitive financial data. To ensure compliance
with this policy, all news media or other public requests for information regarding the Company should be directed to the Company s
Investor Relations Department. The Investor Relations Department will work with you and the appropriate personnel to evaluate and coordinate
a response to the request. 

7 

Prevention
of Selective Disclosure 

Preventing
selective disclosure is necessary to comply with United States securities laws and to preserve the reputation and integrity of the Company
as well as that of all persons affiliated with it. Selective disclosure occurs when any person provides potentially market-moving
information to selected persons before the news is available to the investing public generally. Selective disclosure is a crime under
United States law and the penalties for violating the law are severe. 

The
following guidelines have been established to avoid improper selective disclosure. Every employee is required to follow these procedures: 

All
 contact by the Company with investment analysts, the press and/or members of the media shall be made through the chief executive
 officer, chief financial officer or persons designated by them (collectively, the Media Contacts ). 

Other
 than the Media Contacts, no officer, director or employee shall provide any information regarding the Company or its business to
 any investment analyst or member of the press or media. 

All
 inquiries from third parties, such as industry analysts or members of the media, about the Company or its business should be directed
 to a Media Contact. All presentations to the investment community regarding the Company will be made by us under the direction of
 a Media Contact. 

Other
 than the Media Contacts, any employee who is asked a question regarding the Company or its business by a member of the press or media
 shall respond with No comment and forward the inquiry to a Media Contact. 

These
procedures do not apply to the routine process of making previously released information regarding the Company available upon inquiries
made by investors, investment analysts and members of the media. 

Please
contact the Compliance Officer if you have any questions about the scope or application of the Company s policies regarding selective
disclosure. 

THE
FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT 

Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act 

The
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the FCPA prohibits the Company and its employees and agents from offering or giving
money or any other item of value to win or retain business or to influence any act or decision of any governmental official, political
party, candidate for political office or official of a public international organization. Stated more concisely, the FCPA prohibits the
payment of bribes, kickbacks or other inducements to foreign officials. This prohibition also extends to payments to a sales representative
or agent if there is a reason to believe that the payment will be used indirectly for a prohibited payment to foreign officials. Violation
of the FCPA is a crime that can result in severe fines and criminal penalties, as well as disciplinary action by the Company, up to and
including termination of employment. 

Certain
small facilitation payments to foreign officials may be permissible under the FCPA if customary in the country or locality and intended
to secure routine governmental action. Governmental action is routine if it is ordinarily and commonly performed by a foreign
official and does not involve the exercise of discretion. For instance, routine functions would include setting up a telephone
line or expediting a shipment through customs. To ensure legal compliance, all facilitation payments must receive prior written approval
from the Compliance Officer and must be clearly and accurately reported as a business expense. 

ENVIRONMENT,
HEALTH AND SAFETY 

The
Company is committed to providing a safe and healthy working environment for its employees and avoiding adverse impact and injury to
the environment and the communities in which we do business. Company s employees must comply with all applicable environmental,
health and safety laws, regulations and Company s standards. It is your responsibility to understand and comply with the laws,
regulations and policies that are relevant to your job. Failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations
can result in civil and criminal liability against you and the Company, as well as disciplinary action by the Company, up to and including
termination of employment. You should contact the Compliance Officer if you have any questions about the laws, regulations and policies
that apply to you. 

8 

Environment 

All
Company s employees should strive to conserve resources and reduce waste and emissions through recycling and other energy conservation
measures. You have a responsibility to promptly report any known or suspected violations of environmental laws or any events that may
result in a discharge or emission of hazardous materials. Employees whose jobs involve manufacturing have a special responsibility to
safeguard the environment. Such employees should be particularly alert to the storage, disposal and transportation of waste, and handling
of toxic materials and emissions into the land, water or air. 

Health
and Safety 

The
Company is committed not only to complying with all relevant health and safety laws, but also to conducting business in a manner that
protects the safety of its employees. All employees are required to comply with all applicable health and safety laws, regulations and
policies relevant to their jobs. If you have a concern about unsafe conditions or tasks that present a risk of injury to you, please
report these concerns immediately to your supervisor or the Human Resources Department. 

EMPLOYMENT
PRACTICES 

The
Company pursues fair employment practices in every aspect of its business. The following is intended to be a summary of our employment
policies and procedures. Copies of our detailed policies are available from the Human Resources Department. Company employees must comply
with all applicable labor and employment laws, including anti-discrimination laws and laws related to freedom of association, privacy
and collective bargaining. It is your responsibility to understand and comply with the laws, regulations and policies that are relevant
to your job. Failure to comply with labor and employment laws can result in civil and criminal liability against you and the Company,
as well as disciplinary action by the Company, up to and including termination of employment. You should contact the Compliance Officer
or the Human Resources Department if you have any questions about the laws, regulations and policies that apply to you. 

Harassment

The
Company is committed to providing equal opportunity and fair treatment to all individuals on the basis of merit, without discrimination
because of race, color, religion, national origin, gender (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, age, disability, veteran status
or other characteristic protected by law. The Company prohibits harassment in any form, whether physical or verbal and whether committed
by supervisors, non-supervisory personnel or non-employees. Harassment may include, but is not limited to, offensive sexual flirtations,
unwanted sexual advances or propositions, verbal abuse, sexually or racially degrading words, or the display in the workplace of sexually
suggestive objects or pictures. 

If
you have any complaints about discrimination or harassment, report such conduct to your supervisor or the Human Resources Department.
All complaints will be treated with sensitivity and discretion. Your supervisor, the Human Resources Department and the Company will
protect your confidentiality to the extent possible, consistent with law and the Company s need to investigate your concern. Where
our investigation uncovers harassment or discrimination, we will take prompt corrective action, which may include disciplinary action
by the Company, up to and including, termination of employment. The Company strictly prohibits retaliation against an employee who, in
good faith, files a complaint. 

Any
member of management who has reason to believe that an employee has been the victim of harassment or discrimination or who receives a
report of alleged harassment or discrimination is required to report it to the Human Resources Department immediately.
