 PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 As used in this report, unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms we, our, us, the Company, "Air Products," or registrant include controlled subsidiaries and affiliates of Air Products. 
 About Air Products 
 Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., a Delaware corporation originally founded in 1940, is a world-leading industrial gases company that has built a reputation for its innovative culture, operational excellence, and commitment to safety and the environment. Focused on serving energy, environmental, and emerging markets, we offer a portfolio of products and services that enables customers to improve their environmental performance, product quality, and productivity. 
 Air Products has a sustainability-driven two-pillar growth strategy consisting of the expansion and efficient operation of our core industrial gases business and the execution of projects that provide world-scale clean hydrogen. Our industrial gases business provides essential gases, related equipment, and applications expertise to customers in dozens of industries, including refining, chemicals, metals, electronics, manufacturing, medical, and food. We also develop, engineer, build, own, and operate some of the world s largest clean hydrogen projects that will support the transition to low- and zero-carbon energy in the heavy-duty transportation and industrial sectors. Additionally, we are the world leader in the supply of liquefied natural gas ("LNG") process technology and equipment and provide turbomachinery, membrane systems, and cryogenic containers globally. 
 We manage our operations, assess performance, and report earnings under five reportable segments: Americas; Asia; Europe; Middle East and India; and Corporate and other. The discussion that follows is based on these operations. Refer to Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information , to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Our Businesses 
 Industrial Gases Business 
 Our industrial gases business, which is organized and operated regionally in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Middle East and India segments, produces and sells atmospheric gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, and argon; process gases such as hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), carbon monoxide, and syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide); and specialty gases. Overall regional industrial gases sales constituted over 90 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, approximately half of which were attributable to atmospheric gases. 
 Each of the regional industrial gases segments competes against three global industrial gas companies: Air Liquide S.A., Linde plc, and Messer Group GmbH, as well as regional competitors. Competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, and the development of industrial gas applications. We derive a competitive advantage in locations where we have pipeline networks, which enable us to provide a reliable and economic supply of products to our larger customers. 
 Production 
 Industrial gases are generally produced at or near the point of use given the complexity and inefficiency of storing molecules at low temperatures. The industrial gases business develops, builds, and operates equipment for the production or processing of gases. Atmospheric gases are produced through various air separation processes, of which cryogenic distillation is the most prevalent, while process gases are produced by methods other than air separation. To produce hydrogen, we purify byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries. We have historically produced hydrogen from hydrocarbons exclusively without carbon capture (known as "gray hydrogen"); however, we are also investing in projects that are intended to create a reliable and consistent world-scale source of low-carbon hydrogen produced from hydrocarbons with carbon capture (known as blue hydrogen as well as carbon-free hydrogen produced from renewable energy (known as green hydrogen ).

Table of Conte n t s 

 Electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases. To produce hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas, steam methane reformers use natural gas as the primary raw material, while gasifiers use liquid and solid hydrocarbons as the primary raw material. We mitigate electricity, natural gas, and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas, surcharges, cost pass-through provisions, and tolling arrangements. During fiscal year 2023, no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of power and natural gas. 
 Helium is produced as a byproduct of gases extracted from underground reservoirs, primarily natural gas as well as CO 2 purified before resale. Because helium is generally sourced globally at long distances from point of sale, we maintain an inventory of helium in our fleet of ISO containers as well as at the U.S. Bureau of Land Management underground storage facility in Amarillo, Texas, and our storage cavern near Beaumont, Texas. We obtain helium from several sources globally, including crude helium for purification from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's helium reserve. 
 Supply Modes 
 We distribute gases to our industrial gas customers through different supply modes depending on various factors including the customer's volume requirements and location. Our supply modes are as follows: 
 On-Site Gases Supply mode associated with customers, principally in the energy production and refining, chemical, metals, and electronics industries worldwide, that require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand. Gases are produced and supplied by large facilities we construct or acquire on or near the customers facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities. These sale of gas contracts are generally governed by 15- to 20-year contracts. We also deliver smaller quantities of product through small on-site plants (cryogenic or non-cryogenic generators), typically via a 10- to 15-year sale of gas contract. The contracts within this supply mode generally contain fixed monthly charges and/or minimum purchase requirements with price escalation provisions that are typically based on external indices. Our on-site supply mode generates approximately half our total company sales. 
 Merchant Gases Supply mode for liquid bulk and packaged gas products. Liquid bulk product is delivered in bulk in either liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored, usually in its liquid state, in equipment that we typically design and install at the customer s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed. Liquid bulk sales are usually governed by three- to five-year contracts. Packaged gas products are delivered in small quantities in either cylinders or dewars. We operate packaged gas businesses in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. 
 We maintain inventory in locations that facilitate supply of products to customers on a reasonable delivery schedule. Inventory consists primarily of crude helium, specialty gases, and other industrial gases supplied via the merchant gases supply mode. 
 End Use 
 The refining industry uses hydrogen to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels. This produces cleaner transportation fuels that can be used with other equipment, particularly in the developing hydrogen-for-mobility markets, to significantly reduce emissions that contribute to climate change. Many other industries that already benefit from hydrogen s unique properties to improve quality, optimize performance, and reduce costs are also looking to hydrogen as a fuel that can help decarbonize their manufacturing processes. We have hydrogen fueling stations that support commercial markets as well as demonstration projects across the globe. 
 The chemicals industry uses hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals. The energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification. Oxygen is used in combustion and industrial heating applications, including in the steel, certain nonferrous metals, glass, and cement industries. Nitrogen applications are used in food processing for freezing and preserving flavor, and nitrogen is used for inerting in various fields, including the metals, chemical, and semiconductor industries. Helium is used in laboratories and healthcare for cooling and in other industries for pressurizing, purging, and lifting. Argon is used in the metals and other industries for its unique inerting, thermal conductivity, and other properties. Industrial gases are also used in welding and providing healthcare and are utilized in various manufacturing processes to make them more efficient and to optimize performance.

 Industrial Gases Equipment 
 We design and manufacture equipment for air separation, hydrocarbon recovery and purification, natural gas liquefaction, and liquid helium and liquid hydrogen transport and storage. The Corporate and other segment includes activity related to the sale of cryogenic and gas processing equipment for air separation. The equipment is sold worldwide to customers in a variety of industries, including chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and processing, and steel and primary metals processing. The Corporate and other segment also includes the results of our LNG equipment business, our Gardner Cryogenics business, which fabricates helium and hydrogen transport and storage containers, and our Rotoflow business, which manufactures turboexpanders and other precision rotating equipment. Steel, aluminum, and capital equipment subcomponents such as compressors are the principal raw materials in the manufacturing of equipment. Raw materials for individual projects typically are acquired under firm purchase agreements. Equipment is produced at our manufacturing sites with certain components procured from subcontractors and vendors. Competition in the equipment business is based primarily on plant efficiency, service, technical know-how, and price, as well as schedule and plant performance guarantees. Our sale of equipment supply mode constituted less than 10 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021. 
 Customers 
 We do not have a homogeneous customer base or end market, and no single customer accounts for more than 10 of our consolidated sales. We do have concentrations of customers in specific industries, primarily refining, chemicals, and electronics. Within each of these industries, we have several large-volume customers with long-term contracts. A negative trend affecting one of these industries, or the loss of one of these major customers, although not material to our consolidated revenue, could have an adverse impact on our financial results. 
 Seasonality 
 Our businesses are not subject to seasonal fluctuations to any material extent. 
 Governmental Contracts 
 Our business is not subject to a government entity s renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts that would be material to our business as a whole. 
 Equity Affiliates 
 Our reporting segments include our share of the results of joint ventures accounted for under the equity method. Our share of our investees' net earnings is primarily presented net of income taxes within Equity affiliates income" on our consolidated income statements. The carrying value of our equity method investments is reflected as "Investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates" on our consolidated balance sheets. Substantially all our equity method investments are in foreign industrial gas producers, the largest of which operate in China, India, Italy, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Thailand. For additional information regarding these investments, refer to Note 9, Equity Affiliates , to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 below. 
 International Operations 
 Through our subsidiaries, affiliates, and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, we conduct business in approximately 50 countries and regions outside the United States. Our international businesses are subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls, tariffs, trade sanctions, import and export controls, and other economic, political, and regulatory policies of local governments described in Item 1A, Risk Factors , below. 
 We have controlling interests in foreign subsidiaries that operate in Canada and approximately 10 countries in Latin America (primarily Chile and Brazil); approximately 10 countries and regions in Asia (primarily China, South Korea, and Taiwan); approximately 25 countries in the Europe and Africa region (primarily the Netherlands, the countries of the United Kingdom, and Spain); and approximately five countries in the Middle East, primarily Saudi Arabia. As discussed under "Equity Affiliates" above, we also own non-controlling interests in entities operating in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. 
 Financial information about our foreign operations and investments is included in Note 9, Equity Affiliates ; Note 23, Income Taxes ; and Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information , to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, below. Information about foreign currency translation is included under Foreign Currency in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies , and information on our exposure to currency fluctuations is included in Note 14, Financial Instruments , to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8, below, and in Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk, included under Item 7A, below.

 Technology Development 
 We pursue a market-oriented approach to technology development through research and development, engineering, and commercial development processes. We conduct research and development principally in our laboratories located in the United States (Allentown, Pennsylvania), the United Kingdom (Basingstoke and Carrington), Spain (Barcelona), China (Shanghai), and Saudi Arabia (Dhahran). We also fund and cooperate in research and development programs conducted by a number of major universities and undertake research work funded by others, including the United States government. 
 Development of technology for use within the Industrial Gases business focuses primarily on new and improved processes and equipment for the production and delivery of industrial gases and new or improved applications for industrial gas products. 
 During fiscal year 2023, we owned approximately 625 United States patents, approximately 3,300 foreign patents, and were a licensee under certain patents owned by others. While the patents and licenses are considered important, we do not consider our business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent, patent license, or group of patents or licenses. 
 Environmental Regulation 
 We are subject to various environmental laws, regulations, and public policies in the countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these measures often results in higher capital expenditures and costs. In the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA," the federal Superfund law); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"); and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies , and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8, below. 
 Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases GHG ), including CO 2 . These include existing coverage under the European Union Emission Trading System, the California Cap-and-Trade Program, China s Emission Trading Scheme and its nation-wide expansion, and South Korea s Emission Trading Scheme. In the Netherlands, a CO 2 emissions tax was enacted on 1 January 2021. In Canada, Alberta s Technology Innovation and Emission Reduction System went into effect 1 January 2020. In Ontario, Environment Climate Change Canada s Output Based Pricing System OBPS was replaced by the GHG Emissions Performance Standards ("EPS") program beginning 1 January 2022. In Singapore, the Carbon Pricing Tax Act was implemented effective 1 January 2019. In Taiwan, Greenhouse Gases Emissions Registration and Verification Management Act will be enforced beginning in 2023. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA requires mandatory reporting of GHG emissions and is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. The European Union has issued the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ("CSRD") and California has enacted the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate Related Financial Risk Act that will require reporting and third-party assurance of GHG emissions information for certain entities, and a similar proposal is under consideration by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Furthermore, some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which often result in higher power costs. 
 Increased public concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG emissions. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our operations. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products. 
 Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency and lower emissions. We see significant opportunities for hydrogen for mobility and energy transition, carbon capture technologies, and gasification. 
 Expenditures for capital projects intended to control pollution from existing operating facilities as required under current environmental regulations were not material in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021. We do not expect material expenditures for these projects in fiscal year 2024. 
 For additional information regarding environmental matters, refer to Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements.

 Sustainability 
 Sustainability is at the core of our higher purpose to bring people together to collaborate and innovate solutions to the world s most significant energy and environmental sustainability challenges. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we have committed capital of approximately 15 billion to projects intended to accelerate the energy transition, some of which are already being executed in the United States, Canada, and Saudi Arabia. These low- and zero-carbon hydrogen and other first mover projects demonstrate our commitment to making investments that will make a meaningful difference on climate issues, allowing us to support our customers sustainability journeys, conserve resources, and care for our employees and communities. 
 Our Sustainability Report details our growth strategy and the role our employees play in achieving our goals. Our latest Sustainability Report is available at www.airproducts.com/company/sustainability/sustainability-report. The information posted on our website, including our Sustainability Report, is not incorporated by reference into, and does not form part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Human Capital Management 
 As of 30 September 2023, we had approximately 23,000 employees, of which over 90 were working full-time and 74 were located outside the United States. We have collective bargaining agreements with unions and works councils at certain locations that expire on various dates over the next four years. Over 20 of our total workforce is covered by such agreements. Overall, we have a corporate strategy supported by our leaders and enabled by a positive organizational culture. 
 We believe our employees are our most valuable asset and are critical to our success as an organization. Our goal is to be the safest, most diverse, and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Integral to our success is the continued development of our 4S culture (Safety, Speed, Simplicity and Self-Confidence) and creating a work environment where our employees feel that they belong and matter. Our talent-related initiatives, including employee recruitment and development, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and benefit programs, focus on building and retaining the world-class talent needed to execute our two-pillar growth strategy and fulfill Air Products' higher purpose. 
 Safety 
 Safety is fundamental to who we are as a company. Safety is a shared value, and our employees commitment to safety is demonstrated in many ways every day. Safety is a critical component of everything we do, everywhere in the world. Our goal is to be the safest industrial gas company in the world. 
 Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging 
 Our 2023 Sustainability Report sets forth our announced goals to further increase the percentage of women and U.S. minorities in professional and managerial roles and the recruitment and talent development strategies we have in place to ensure we meet these ambitions. By 2025, Air Products aims to achieve at least 28 percent female representation in the professional and managerial population globally, and at least 30 percent minority representation in that same population in the United States. We established these goals following analysis of our global employee representation metrics and future talent needs, as well as assessing industry benchmarks and peer companies.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our operations are affected by various risks, many of which are beyond our control. In evaluating investment in the Company and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere from time to time, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. The risks described below are not all inclusive but are designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. In addition to such risks, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be significant, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses. 
 Risks Related to Economic Conditions 
 Changes in global and regional economic conditions, the markets we serve, or the financial markets may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. 
 Unfavorable conditions in the global economy or regional economies, the markets we serve or financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues, operating results, and cash flows. 
 Demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business. Weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future. In addition, our growth strategy is largely based on demand for technologies and projects that limit the impact of global climate change. Demand for our solutions could be negatively impacted if public and private actors reduce their focus on reducing carbon emissions. Reduced demand for our products and services would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings. In addition, reduced demand could depress sales, decrease our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity, or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring. Excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits. 
 In addition, our operating results in one or more segments may be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions for particular customer markets within a segment. A decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can reduce demand for our products and services and impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to us, resulting in uncollected receivables, unanticipated contract terminations, project delays or the inability to recover plant investments, any of which may negatively impact our financial results. 
 Weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or defaults or otherwise make us unable to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming on-stream when expected. These or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific market, product, or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, or intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results. 
 Our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational, economic, political, security, legal, and currency translation risks that could decrease profitability. 
 In fiscal year 2023, approximately 60 of our sales were derived from customers outside the United States and many of our operations, suppliers, and employees are located outside the United States. Our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations, import and trade restrictions, trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad. Changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions, strained relations between countries, or the imposition of tariffs or international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows. 
 11 

Table of Conte n t s 

 Our growth strategies depend in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States, such as China, India, and the Middle East, and involve significantly larger and more complex projects, including gasification and large-scale hydrogen projects, some in regions where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions. We are actively investing large amounts of capital and other resources, in some cases through joint ventures, in developing markets, which we believe to have high growth potential. Our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies, including political and economic instability, project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions, inadequate investment in infrastructure, undeveloped property rights and legal systems, unfamiliar regulatory environments, relationships with local partners, language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting, training and retaining qualified employees. In addition, our properties and contracts in these locations may be subject to seizure and cancellation, respectively, without full compensation for loss. Successful operation of particular facilities or execution of projects may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of war, sabotage or terrorism, and other local security concerns. Such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or require us to shut down operations for a period of time. 
 Furthermore, because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the United States, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period. Our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. We choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries earnings into dollars. Accordingly, reported sales, net earnings, cash flows, and fair values have been, and in the future will be, affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. For a more detailed discussion of currency exposure, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk , below. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 Risks related to the approval, execution, and operation of our projects, particularly with respect to our largest projects, may adversely affect our operations or financial results. 
 A significant and growing portion of our business involves clean hydrogen, carbon capture, gasification, and other large-scale projects that involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases that may last several years and involve the investment of billions of dollars. These projects are technically complex, often reliant on significant interaction with government authorities, and face significant financing, development, operational, and reputational risks. These projects may also be subject to complex government approvals, as well as legal or regulatory challenges by government authorities or third parties. Delays in receiving required approvals or related to litigation could require us to delay or abandon certain projects, which may result in the incurrence of additional expense, the loss of invested proceeds and reputational damage. 
 We have in the past and may in the future encounter difficulties related to the development of projects that may result in delays, scope changes and additional costs. Such difficulties may relate to engineering, delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party, equipment and materials delivery delays, schedule changes, customer scope changes, delays related to obtaining regulatory permits and rights-of-way, inability to find adequate sources of labor in the locations where we are building new plants, weather-related delays, delays by customers' contractors in completing their portion of a project, technical or transportation difficulties, cost overruns, supply difficulties, geopolitical risks and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, that may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule. In some cases, delays and additional costs may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We also may be required to cancel a project and/or compensate the customer for the delay, which may also cause us to incur material costs that we may be unable to recover. In addition, in some cases we seek financing for large projects and face market risk associated with the availability and terms of such financing. These financing arrangements may require that we comply with certain performance requirements which, if not met, could result in default and restructuring costs or other losses. All of these factors could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties, any of which could adversely affect our ability to secure new projects in the future. 
 In addition, several of our large-scale projects are being built before finalization of offtake agreements, which may create uncertainty regarding future pricing and other commercial terms. If we are unable to enter into favorable commercial agreements with prospective customers, our projected returns could be adversely impacted, which may harm our business and financial performance.

 The operation of our facilities, pipelines, and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as pipeline leaks and ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, vehicle accidents, or cyber incidents. If operational risks materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations, reputation, financial results, and cash flows. In addition, our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements, which depend, in part, on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets. 
 We are subject to extensive government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Regulations addressing, among other things, import/export restrictions, anti-bribery and corruption, and taxes, can negatively impact our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows. 
 We are subject to government regulation in the United States and in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business. The application of laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear. Compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that could result in reduced profitability. If there is a determination that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties or sanctions that could adversely impact our reputation and financial results. Compliance with changes in laws or regulations can result in increased operating costs and require additional, unplanned capital expenditures. Export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so. Changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of our businesses. Increasingly aggressive enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law, could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation is deemed to have occurred. In addition, we are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit us, or certain of our affiliates, from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the kind of business that we may conduct. Such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities. 
 Further, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents, business partners or that businesses that we acquire would not violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering, and data privacy. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. 
 We may be unable to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, manage our joint ventures, or effectively disentangle divested businesses. 
 Our ability to grow revenue, earnings, and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify, successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices, and realize expected growth, synergies, and operating efficiencies. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns, the failure to integrate acquired businesses, the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions, and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack adequate contractual protections or insurance. In addition, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations. 
 In addition, some of our largest projects involve joint ventures. These arrangements may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including our ability to cooperate with our strategic partners, our strategic partners having interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and the potential that our strategic partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations to the joint venture, which may negatively impact the expected benefits of the joint venture and cause us to incur additional expense or suffer reputational damage. In addition, due to the nature of these arrangements, we may have limited ability to direct or influence the management of the joint venture, which may limit our ability to assist and oversee the design and implementation of the joint venture s business as well as its accounting, legal, governance, human resources, information technology, and other administrative systems. This may expose us to additional risks and uncertainties because we may be dependent upon and subject to liability, losses, or reputational damage relating to systems, controls, and personnel that are not under our control. These risks may be augmented when the joint venture is operating outside the United States due to differences in language, culture, and regulation, as well as the factors listed above that are relevant to our international operations.

Table of Conte n t s 

 We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. These transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. For example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated time frame or at all. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts, distract management, and give rise to disputes with buyers. In addition, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities. Our financial results could be impacted adversely by claims under these indemnification provisions. 
 The security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate. 
 We depend on information technology to enable us to operate safely and efficiently and interface with our customers as well as to maintain our internal control environment and financial reporting accuracy and efficiency. Our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, property damage, or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach. In addition, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Security breaches of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other business partners) could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized access or disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, and may subject us to legal liability. 
 As with most large systems, our information technology systems have in the past been, and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks, and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. To date, we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts; however, unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations, result in the loss of assets, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could: interrupt our operations at one or more sites; delay production and shipments; result in the theft of our and our customers intellectual property and trade secrets; damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation; result in defective products or services, physical damage to facilities, pipelines or delivery systems, including those we own or operate for third parties, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws, or increased costs for security and remediation; or raise concerns regarding our internal control environment and internal control over financial reporting. Each of these consequences could adversely affect our business, reputation and our financial statements. 
 Our business involves the use, storage, and transmission of information about our employees, vendors, and customers. The protection of such information, as well as our proprietary information, is critical to us. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. We have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. We also, from time to time, export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the United States. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability. These events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business. 
 Interruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability. 
 Hydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas. Energy, including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel for delivery trucks, is the largest cost component of our business. Because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity, inflation and energy price fluctuations have impacted our revenues and earnings and may continue to do so in the future. A disruption in the supply of energy, components, or raw materials, whether due to market conditions, legislative or regulatory actions, natural disasters, public health crises and pandemics, or other disruption, could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments and harm our business and financial results.

Table of Conte n t s 

 Our supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers. Lower natural gas production resulting from natural gas pricing dynamics, supplier operating or transportation issues, or other interruptions in sales from crude helium suppliers, can reduce our supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to customers. 
 We typically contract to pass-through cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers, but such cost pass-through results in declining margins, and cost variability can negatively impact our other operating results. For example, we may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise, or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery of such costs. In addition, increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons may negatively impact our revenues and earnings. Even where costs are passed through, price increases can cause lower sales volume. 
 New technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation. 
 We are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings. Existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base. These technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations. Failure of the technologies to work as predicted, or unintended consequences of new designs or uses, could lead to cost overruns, project delays, financial penalties, or damage to our reputation. We may face difficulties marketing products produced using new technologies including, but not limited to, green hydrogen, which may adversely impact our sales and financial results. In addition, certain large-scale projects may contain processes or technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination, and although such projects generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others, such technologies or processes may be new to us and may introduce new risks to our operations. Additionally, there is also a risk that our new technologies may become obsolete and be replaced by other market alternatives. Performance difficulties on these larger projects may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In addition, performance challenges may adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future contracts. 
 Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our technological development, and we may suffer competitive harm from infringement on such rights. 
 As we develop new technologies, it is critical that we protect our intellectual property assets against third-party infringement. We own a number of patents and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services. As we develop new technologies there is a risk that our patent applications may not be granted, or we may not receive sufficient protection of our proprietary interests. We may also expend considerable resources in defending our patents against third-party infringement. It is critical that we protect our proprietary interests to prevent competitive harm. 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 Legislative, regulatory, societal, and market efforts to address global climate change may impact our business and create financial risk. 
 We are the world s leading supplier of hydrogen, the primary use of which is the production of ultra-low sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health. To make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers, we have historically used steam methane reforming to produce hydrogen without carbon capture (i.e., "gray hydrogen"), which results in the emission of carbon dioxide. In addition, gasification enables the conversion of lower value feedstocks into cleaner energy and value-added products; however, our gasification projects also produce carbon dioxide. Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing disclosure of GHG emissions, including CO 2 , such as the European Union's CSRD, California s Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and Climate Related Financial Risk Act, and similar regulations under consideration by the SEC, which may lead to direct and indirect costs on our operations. We could also face scrutiny from stakeholders regarding our reporting under various frameworks for disclosing GHG emissions-related data, including those we use currently in our sustainability reporting. If our GHG emissions-related data, processes, and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to comply with relevant reporting frameworks from newly emerging regulations, we may incur monetary penalties and reputational harm, and we could become subject to litigation or government investigations, which may also adversely affect our reputation and business. 
 15 

Table of Conte n t s 

 Increased public concern and governmental action may result in more international, U.S. federal and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG emissions or increased demand for technologies and projects to limit the impact of global climate change. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and application of our gasification technology, although these developments may be mitigated by our growth strategy focused on world-scale clean hydrogen projects. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our operations. Any legislation or governmental action that limits or taxes GHG emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products, particularly for our core industrial gases business. 
 In addition, our growth strategy is partially dependent on a regulatory environment that favors technologies focused on limiting the impact of climate change, in particular toward the production and distribution of clean hydrogen. For example, we anticipate benefits from tax incentives created by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for carbon sequestration and clean hydrogen production in future years once our projects in these areas come on-stream in the U.S. If there is a reversal in the regulatory environment or a discontinuation or reduction of incentives or benefits for the development of technologies limiting the impact of climate change, particularly those focused on low- and zero-carbon hydrogen production, demand for our products may be less than we anticipate and certain projects and our long-term growth strategy could be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. 
 Our operations may present a safety risk to our employees. 
 Notwithstanding our emphasis on the safety of our employees and contractors and the precautions we take related to health and safety, we may be unable to avoid safety incidents relating to our operations that result in injuries or deaths. Certain safety incidents may result in legal or regulatory action that could result in increased expenses or reputational damage. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths. Changes to federal, state, and local employee health and safety regulations, and legislative, regulatory, or societal responses to safety incidents may result in heightened regulations or public scrutiny that may increase our compliance costs or result in reputational damage. 
 Our business depends on our ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employees. 
 Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain employees with the skills necessary to our business. Competitive labor market conditions have resulted in increased demand for qualified personnel, which makes it difficult to attract, hire, and retain employees with specialized technical experience. In addition, the increasing number of experienced employees becoming retirement-eligible and our company headcount growth further amplify this challenge. The number of our employees has grown both internationally and in the United States, with our total headcount increasing from approximately 16,300 at the end of fiscal 2018 to approximately 23,000 at the end of fiscal 2023. Our results of operations have been and in the future could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for skilled talent in the market. In addition, increased turnover and decreased tenure of employees may impact productivity, costs, and organizational culture. We undertake significant efforts to hire, engage, and retain our employees and to effectively manage workforce costs, even with rapid political, social, and economic shifts in our markets. If these efforts are unsuccessful, our growth may be limited and we may suffer financial or reputational harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 Our financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including antitrust, tax, environmental, or other matters. 
 We are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. While we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements, there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable. Also, the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to predict reliably. Various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in any particular period.

 Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results. 
 We are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air; discharges to land and water; and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of adverse environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our products. Future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. In addition, laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment, compliance, and remediation. These additional costs may adversely affect our financial results. For a more detailed description of these matters, see Item 1, Business Environmental Regulation , above. 
 A change of tax law in key jurisdictions could result in a material increase in our tax expense. 
 The multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. 
 Changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Various levels of government, including the U.S. federal government, are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue. Further changes in tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our business, financial results, and cash flows. 
 Our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control, including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, epidemics, pandemics, acts of war, and terrorism. Any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose us to third-party liability claims. Additionally, such events could impact our suppliers, customers, and partners, which could cause energy and raw materials to be unavailable to us, or our customers to be unable to purchase or accept our products and services. Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results. 
 Inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance. 
 We face strong competition from large global competitors and many smaller regional competitors in many of our business segments. Introduction by competitors of new technologies, competing products, or additional capacity could weaken demand for, or impact pricing of our products, negatively impacting financial results. In addition, competitors pricing policies could affect our profitability or market share.

 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings, including commercial, competition, environmental, intellectual property, regulatory, product liability, and insurance matters. Although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business, such litigation could result in large monetary awards, especially if compensatory and/or punitive damages are awarded. However, we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on our financial position, earnings, or cash flows. 
 From time to time, we are also involved in proceedings, investigations, and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental, health, safety, competition, and tax matters. 
 We are a party to proceedings under CERCLA, RCRA, and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Presently there are 27 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where we, usually along with others, have been designated a potentially responsible party by the Environmental Protection Agency or are otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation, including cleanup activity at certain of our current and former manufacturing sites. We do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these environmental matters would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position. Additional information on our environmental exposure is included under Item 1, Business Environmental Regulation, and Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements. 
 In September 2010, the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense ("CADE") issued a decision against our Brazilian subsidiary, Air Products Brasil Ltda., and several other Brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities. CADE imposed a civil fine of R 179.2 million (approximately 36 million at 30 September 2023) on Air Products Brasil Ltda. This fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Justice, following an investigation beginning in 2003, which alleged violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases. The fines are based on a percentage of our total revenue in Brazil in 2003. 
 We have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in October 2010 with the Brazilian courts. On 6 May 2014, our appeal was granted and the fine against Air Products Brasil Ltda. was dismissed. CADE has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending. We, with advice of our outside legal counsel, have assessed the status of this matter and have concluded that, although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible, such a judgment is not probable. As a result, no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements. In the event of an adverse final judgment, we estimate the maximum possible loss to be the full amount of the fine of R 179.2 million (approximately 36 million at 30 September 2023) plus interest accrued thereon until final disposition of the proceedings. 
 In April 2023, we received a favorable ruling from a Texas state court in litigation involving disputed energy management charges related to Winter Storm Uri, a severe winter weather storm that impacted the U.S. Gulf Coast in February 2021. The ruling is subject to appeal and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2023. 
 Other than the matters discussed above, we do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, that are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.

Our core business provides essential gases, related equipment, and applications expertise to customers in dozens of industries, including refining, chemicals, metals, electronics, manufacturing, medical, and food. We also develop, engineer, build, own, and operate some of the world s largest clean hydrogen projects that will support the transition to low- and zero-carbon energy in the heavy-duty transportation and industrial sectors. Additionally, we are the world leader in the supply of LNG process technology and equipment and provide turbomachinery, membrane systems, and cryogenic containers globally. For additional information on our product and service offerings, including production, distribution, and end use, refer to Item 1, Business , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Air Products conducts business in approximately 50 countries and regions throughout the world. Our industrial gases business is organized and operated regionally in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Middle East and India segments and generates the majority of our sales via our on-site and merchant supply modes. Approximately half our total revenue is generated through the on-site supply mode, which is governed by contracts that are generally long-term in nature with provisions that allow us to pass through changes in energy costs to our customers. Our Corporate and other segment includes the results of our sale of equipment businesses, costs for corporate support functions and global management activities, and other income and expenses not directly associated with the regional segments, such as foreign exchange gains and losses. For additional information regarding our supply modes and business segments, refer to Note 6, Revenue Recognition , and Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information , to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 2023 IN SUMMARY 
 In fiscal year 2023, we achieved earnings growth through pricing discipline in our merchant business as well as improved on-site volumes, including higher demand for hydrogen, despite inflation, higher maintenance activities, and higher costs to support our long-term strategy. Due to the structure of our contracts, which generally contain fixed monthly charges and/or minimum purchase requirements, our on-site business generates stable cash flow and consistently contributes about half our total sales, regardless of the economic environment. We also recognized higher income from our equity affiliates due to the contribution of the second phase of the Jazan gasification and power project and positive results from other unconsolidated joint ventures across the regions. 
 Additionally, we successfully secured capital to fund low- and zero-carbon hydrogen growth projects. In March, we issued our inaugural green bonds in concurrent 600 and 700 million debt offerings, making Air Products the first U.S. chemical company to qualify green and blue hydrogen projects as an eligible expenditure category. Additionally, in May, our NEOM Green Hydrogen Company joint venture completed financial close on the world s largest green hydrogen-based ammonia production facility, securing 6.1 billion of non-recourse financing from local, regional, and international banks and financial institutions. This funding is an important strategic milestone that will allow us to continue executing projects that will accelerate the energy transition while creating long-term value for our shareholders. 
 In addition to investing in high return projects, we believe creating shareholder value includes paying quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, which we have increased for 41 consecutive years. In fiscal year 2023, we increased our dividend to 1.75 per share, representing an 8 increase, or 0.13 per share, from the previous dividend of 1.62 per share.

 Fiscal Year 2023 Highlights 
 Sales of 12.6 billion decreased 1 , or 98.6, as lower energy cost pass-through to customers of 6 and unfavorable currency of 3 were mostly offset by higher pricing of 5 and higher volumes of 3 . 
 Operating income of 2.5 billion increased 7 , or 155.8, as our pricing actions and higher volumes were partially offset by higher costs and unfavorable currency. Additionally, we recorded higher charges for business and asset actions in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. Operating margin of 19.8 increased 140 basis points ("bp") from 18.4 in the prior year, which included a positive impact from lower energy cost pass-through to customers in 2023. 
 Equity affiliates' income of 604.3 increased 26 , or 122.8, primarily due to a higher contribution from the Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company ("JIGPC") joint venture, which completed the second phase of the asset purchase associated with the Jazan gasification and power project in January 2023, as well as higher income from our affiliates in Italy and Mexico. The prior year included recognition of the remaining deferred profit associated with air separation units previously sold to Jazan Gas Project Company, which was partially offset by an impairment charge related to two small affiliates in our Asia segment. 
 Net income of 2.3 billion increased 3 , or 72.1, primarily due to favorable pricing, net of power and fuel costs, partially offset by a charge for business and asset actions, higher non-service pension costs, and higher other costs. Net income margin of 18.6 increased 80 bp from 17.8 in the prior year, which included a positive impact from lower energy cost pass-through. 
 Adjusted EBITDA of 4.7 billion increased 11 , or 454.8, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.3 increased 390 bp from 33.4 in the prior year. 
 Diluted EPS of 10.30 increased 2 , or 0.22 per share, and adjusted diluted EPS of 11.51 increased 12 , or 1.26 per share. A summary table of changes in diluted EPS is presented below.

 OUTLOOK 
 The guidance below should be read in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The first pillar of our two-pillar growth strategy is our core industrial gas business, which is supported by a consistent stream of revenue due to the structure of our on-site contracts. We expect new on-site projects, including the natural gas-to-syngas processing facility in Uzbekistan, as well as several new LNG sale of equipment projects to contribute to our results in 2024. To mitigate the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures, we are focused on actions we can control, such as maintaining pricing discipline in our merchant business. Additionally, we expect to see cost improvement in certain areas of our organization as a result of strategic business actions taken earlier in 2023. 
 The second pillar of our strategy is our blue and green hydrogen projects, many of which are already under execution. We anticipate benefits from tax incentives created by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for carbon sequestration and clean hydrogen production in future years once our projects in these areas come on-stream, such as our blue hydrogen and blue ammonia clean energy complex in Louisiana. We are also gaining support from foreign regulators for our projects outside the U.S., including the recently announced blue hydrogen project in the Netherlands. We believe the infrastructure readiness we are preparing now will continue to be a competitive advantage for Air Products, allowing us to create sustainable growth opportunities that deliver value to our shareholders, customers, employees, and communities around the world.

 Sales of 12.6 billion decreased 1 , or 98.6, as lower energy cost pass-through to customers of 6 and unfavorable currency of 3 were mostly offset by higher pricing of 5 and higher volumes of 3 . Lower natural gas prices in the Americas and Europe segments drove the lower energy cost pass-through to our on-site customers. Unfavorable currency was primarily attributable to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Chinese Renminbi. Pricing actions in our merchant business improved sales across each of our regional segments, while the volume improvement was primarily attributable to our on-site business in the Americas and Asia segments.

Table of Conte n t s 

 Cost of Sales and Gross Margin 
 Cost of sales of 8.8 billion decreased 5 , or 505.5, due to lower energy cost pass-through to customers of 791 and a favorable impact from currency of 213, partially offset by higher costs associated with sales volumes of 311 and unfavorable other costs of 188. The unfavorable costs were driven by inflation, project development activities, and planned maintenance. Gross margin of 29.9 increased 340 bp from 26.5 in the prior year primarily due to favorable pricing and lower energy cost pass-through to customers, partially offset by the impact of higher costs. The favorable impact from lower energy cost pass-through to customers was about 200 bp. 
 Selling and Administrative Expense 
 Selling and administrative expense of 957.0 increased 6 , or 56.4, primarily due to higher employee compensation, inflation, and additional costs to support growth, partially offset by a favorable impact from currency. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased to 7.6 from 7.1 in the prior year. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Research and development expense of 105.6 increased 3 , or 2.7. Research and development expense as a percentage of sales of 0.8 was flat versus the prior year. 
 Business and Asset Actions 
 In fiscal year 2023, we recorded a charge of 244.6 204.9 attributable to Air Products after tax, or 0.92 per share) for strategic actions intended to optimize costs and focus resources on our growth projects. Of the expense, 217.6 resulted from noncash charges to write off assets associated with exited projects that were previously under construction. The remaining expense included 27.0 for severance and other benefits associated with position eliminations and restructuring of certain organizations globally. Refer to Note 4, Business and Asset Actions , for additional information. 
 In fiscal year 2022, we divested our small industrial gas business in Russia due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As a result, we recorded a noncash charge of 73.7 61.0 after tax, or 0.27 per share), which included transaction costs and cumulative currency translation losses. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income of 34.8 decreased 38 , or 21.1, primarily due to lower income from the sale of assets and fees charged to our equity affiliates for use of patents and technology as well as an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. 
 Operating Income and Margin 
 Operating income of 2.5 billion increased 7 , or 155.8. Positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of 649 and higher volumes of 58 were partially offset by higher costs of 302 and an unfavorable currency impact of 78. The higher costs were driven by inflation, planned maintenance, and incentive compensation, as well as project development and other costs related to the execution of our growth strategy. Additionally, as discussed above, we recorded higher charges for business and asset actions in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. Operating margin of 19.8 increased 140 bp from 18.4 in the prior year, primarily due to the impact of pricing as well as lower energy cost pass-through to customers, which positively impacted margin by about 100 basis points, partially offset by higher charges for business and asset actions and higher other costs. 
 Equity Affiliates Income 
 Equity affiliates' income of 604.3 increased 26 , or 122.8, primarily due to a higher contribution from the JIGPC joint venture, which completed the second phase of the asset purchase associated with the Jazan gasification and power project in January 2023, as well as higher income from our affiliates in Italy and Mexico. Additionally, the prior year included an impairment charge of 14.8 11.1 after tax, or 0.05 per share) related to two small affiliates in the Asia segment. These impacts were partially offset by the prior year recognition of the remaining deferred profit associated with air separation units previously sold to Jazan Gas Project Company, net of other project finalization costs.

 Interest Expense 
 Fiscal Year Ended 30 September 2023 2022 Interest incurred 292.9 169.0 Less: Capitalized interest 115.4 41.0 Interest expense 177.5 128.0 
 Interest incurred increased 73 , or 123.9, driven by a higher average interest rate on variable-rate instruments in our debt portfolio as well as a higher debt balance, which is largely attributable to the U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes issued in March 2023 under our new Green Finance Framework as well as borrowings on our foreign credit facilities. Capitalized interest increased 74.4 due to a higher carrying value of projects under construction. 
 Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net 
 Other non-operating expense was 39.0 versus income of 62.4 in the prior year primarily due to higher non-service pension costs in 2023, which were driven by higher interest cost and lower expected returns on plan assets for the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. This impact was partially offset by higher interest income on cash and cash items due to higher interest rates. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was 7.4 0.03 per share) and 12.6 0.06 per share) in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. This primarily resulted from the release of unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions taken with respect to the sale of our former Performance Materials Division for which the statute of limitations expired. 
 Net Income and Net Income Margin 
 Net income of 2.3 billion increased 3 , or 72.1, primarily due to favorable pricing, net of power and fuel costs, partially offset by the charge for business and asset actions, higher non-service pension costs, and higher other costs. Net income margin of 18.6 increased 80 bp from 17.8 in the prior year due to the factors noted above as well as lower energy cost pass-through to customers, which positively impacted margin by about 100 bp. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 Adjusted EBITDA of 4.7 billion increased 11 , or 454.8, primarily due to higher pricing, net of power and fuel costs, partially offset by higher costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.3 increased 390 bp from 33.4 in the prior year due to the factors noted above as well as lower energy cost pass-through to customers, which positively impacted margin by about 200 bp. 
 Effective Tax Rate 
 The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 23, Income Taxes , to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate. 
 Our effective tax rate was 19.1 and 18.2 for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2023 and 2022, respectively. During fiscal year 2023, we recorded a charge for business and asset actions of 244.6 204.9 attributable to Air Products after tax). Refer to Note 4, Business and Asset Actions , to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The charge included certain losses for which we could not recognize an income tax benefit and were subject to a valuation allowance of 36.0. Partially offsetting the valuation allowance cost was a 15.9 income tax benefit from a tax election related to a non-U.S. subsidiary. 
 Our effective tax rate for the current year was higher due to lower excess tax benefits on share-based compensation and the discrete tax impact of our business and asset actions discussed above. In addition, certain recurring income tax benefits had less of an impact on our effective tax rate in the current year as they did not increase in proportion to the increase in income. Our current rate is also higher due to nonrecurring benefits in several foreign jurisdictions due to the impact of tax rate changes and productivity credit claims in the prior year. 
 Our adjusted effective tax rate, which does not include the impact of our business and asset actions discussed above, was 18.9 and 18.1 for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 Sales of 5.4 billion were flat as higher volumes of 6 and higher pricing of 6 were offset by lower energy cost pass-through to customers of 11 and an unfavorable currency impact of 1 . The volume improvement was primarily attributable to our on-site business, including better demand for hydrogen. Additionally, we recovered higher costs in our merchant business through continued focus on pricing actions. Energy cost pass-through to our on-site customers was lower due to lower natural gas prices. 
 Operating income of 1.4 billion increased 23 , or 265.3, due to positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of 306 and favorable volumes of 78, partially offset by higher costs of 112 and an unfavorable currency impact of 7. Higher costs were driven by inflation, planned maintenance, and higher incentive compensation. Operating margin of 26.8 increased 490 bp from 21.9 in the prior year primarily due to favorable pricing and lower energy cost pass-through to customers, partially offset by higher costs. The favorable impact from lower energy cost pass-through to customers was about 250 bp. 
 Equity affiliates income of 109.2 increased 11 , or 11.0, driven by an affiliate in Mexico.

 Sales of 3.2 billion increased 2 , or 72.8, due to higher volumes of 3 , positive pricing of 3 , and higher energy cost pass-through to customers of 2 , partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts of 6 . Positive volume contributions from several new traditional industrial gas plants in our on-site business were partially offset by weak economic growth in China and lower activity in the electronics manufacturing industry. Higher power costs across the region were recovered by our merchant pricing actions. In our on-site business, the higher power costs increased energy cost pass-through to our customers. The unfavorable currency impact was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Chinese Renminbi. 
 Operating income of 906.5 increased 1 , or 8.2, due to positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of 59 and higher volumes of 31, partially offset by an unfavorable currency impact of 56 and higher costs of 26. The higher costs were driven by project development, higher planned maintenance, and inflation. Operating margin of 28.2 decreased 40 bp from 28.6 in the prior year as higher costs were partially offset by our pricing actions.

 Sales of 3.0 billion decreased 4 , or 123.0, due to lower energy cost pass-through to customers of 9 and an unfavorable currency impact of 2 , partially offset by higher pricing of 7 . Energy cost pass-through to our on-site customers was lower, reflecting lower natural gas prices across the region. Currency negatively impacted sales due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. The pricing improvement was attributable to our merchant business. Volumes were flat as improvement in hydrogen in our on-site business was offset by lower demand for merchant products. 
 Operating income of 663.4 increased 32 , or 160.0, as higher pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of 275 was partially offset by higher costs of 100 driven by inflation, higher incentive compensation, and planned maintenance, unfavorable business mix of 8, and an unfavorable currency impact of 7. Operating margin of 22.4 increased 610 bp from 16.3 in the prior year due to the factors noted above as well as lower energy cost pass-through to customers, which positively impacted margin by about 100 bp.

 RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 (Millions of U.S. Dollars unless otherwise indicated, except for per share data) 
 We present certain financial measures, other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), on an "adjusted" or "non-GAAP" basis. On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, the adjusted effective tax rate, and capital expenditures. On a segment basis, these measures include adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In addition to these measures, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items, or "non-GAAP adjustments," have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 In many cases, non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude non-GAAP adjustments that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. For example, we exclude the impact of the non-service components of net periodic benefit/cost for our defined benefit pension plans as further discussed below. Additionally, we may exclude certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions, impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. The reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future. 
 When applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions. 
 We provide these non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others to evaluate the performance of our business in the same manner as our management. We believe these measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. However, we caution readers not to consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another. 
 NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENT FOR NON-SERVICE PENSION COST (BENEFIT), NET 
 Our adjusted EPS and the adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of non-service related components of net periodic benefit/cost for our defined benefit pension plans. The prior year non-GAAP financial measures presented above and reconciled below have been recast accordingly to conform to the fiscal year 2023 presentation. Non-service related components are recurring, non-operating items that include interest cost, expected returns on plan assets, prior service cost amortization, actuarial loss amortization, as well as special termination benefits, curtailments, and settlements. The net impact of non-service related components is reflected within Other non-operating income (expense), net on our consolidated income statements. Adjusting for the impact of non-service pension components provides management and users of our financial statements with a more accurate representation of our underlying business performance because these components are driven by factors that are unrelated to our operations, such as recent changes to the allocation of our pension plan assets associated with de-risking as well as volatility in equity and debt markets. Further, non-service related components are not indicative of our defined benefit plans future contribution needs due to the funded status of the plans.

 ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS 
 The table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which we view as a key performance metric. In periods that we have non-GAAP adjustments, we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of each such adjustment because management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance. Per share impacts are calculated independently and may not sum to total diluted EPS and total adjusted diluted EPS due to rounding.

 ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN 
 We define adjusted EBITDA as net income less income from discontinued operations, net of tax, and excluding non-GAAP adjustments, which we do not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non-operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful metrics for management to assess operating performance. Margins are calculated independently for each period by dividing each line item by consolidated sales for the respective period and may not sum to total margin due to rounding.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 
 Capital expenditures is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as the sum of cash flows for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, acquisitions (less cash acquired), investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates, and investment in financing receivables on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Additionally, we adjust additions to plant and equipment to exclude NEOM Green Hydrogen Company NGHC expenditures funded by the joint venture's non-recourse project financing as well as our partners equity contributions to arrive at a measure that we believe is more representative of our investment activities. Substantially all the funding we provide to NGHC is limited for use by the venture for capital expenditures.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We believe we have sufficient cash, cash flows from operations, and funding sources to meet our liquidity needs. As further discussed in the "Cash Flows From Financing Activities" section below, we have the ability to raise capital through a variety of financing activities, including accessing capital or commercial paper markets or drawing upon our credit facilities. 
 As of 30 September 2023, we had 1,497.1 of foreign cash and cash items compared to total cash and cash items of 1,617.0. We do not expect that a significant portion of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates will be subject to U.S. income tax upon repatriation to the U.S. Depending on the country in which the subsidiaries and affiliates reside, the repatriation of these earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes. However, since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items that would be subject to additional taxes outside the U.S.

Business and asset actions of 244.6 included noncash charges to write off assets related to our exit from certain projects previously under construction as well as an expense for severance and other benefits. Refer to Note 4, Business and Asset Actions , to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The impacts associated with our operating leases are reflected within "Other adjustments," which included a lump-sum payment of 209 for a land lease associated with the NGHC joint venture. Working capital accounts resulted in a net use of cash of 424.8. The use of cash of 213.3 within payables and accrued liabilities primarily resulted from lower prices for the purchase of natural gas, a decrease in value of derivatives that hedge intercompany loans, and payments for incentive compensation under the fiscal year 2022 plan. Inventories resulted in a use of cash of 129.4 primarily due to additional packaged gases inventory, including helium. The use of cash of 119.0 within other working capital was primarily driven by the timing of income tax payments. The source of cash of 130.7 from trade receivables was primarily attributable to collection of higher natural gas costs contractually passed through to on-site customers in fiscal year 2023.

 In fiscal year 2022, cash provided by operating activities was 3,170.6. Undistributed earnings of equity method investments of 214.7 reflects activity from the JIGPC joint venture, which began contributing to our results in late October 2021. We received cash distributions of approximately 155 from this joint venture during fiscal year 2022. Other adjustments of 304.9 included adjustments for noncash currency impacts of intercompany balances, deferred costs associated with new projects, contributions to pension plans, and payments made for leasing activities. Working capital accounts resulted in a net use of cash of 115.8. The use of cash of 475.2 within trade receivables included the impacts of higher underlying sales and higher natural gas costs passed through to our on-site customers. The source of cash of 532.5 within payables and accrued liabilities primarily resulted from higher natural gas costs and customer advances for sale of equipment projects. Other working capital accounts resulted in a use of cash of 77.0 primarily due to contract fulfillment costs and the timing of income tax payments.

Table of Conte n t s 

 Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2023 totaled 5,224.4 compared to 4,650.0 in fiscal year 2022. The increase of 574.4 was driven by spending for plant and equipment, which was largely attributable to purchases associated with our low- and zero-carbon hydrogen projects, as well as ongoing maintenance capital spending. Higher spending for plant and equipment was partially offset by lower investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates, as the second phase of our investment in JIGPC of 908 in fiscal year 2023 was lower than the initial investment of 1.6 billion completed in fiscal year 2022. These investments included approximately 130 and 73 in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, received from a noncontrolling partner in one of our subsidiaries. We expect to complete a remaining investment of approximately 115. Refer to Note 9, Equity Affiliates , to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Fiscal year 2023 also included an investment in financing receivables of 665.1, primarily for progress payments towards the purchase of a natural gas-to-syngas processing facility in Uzbekistan. Refer to Note 5, Acquisitions , to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Outlook for Investing Activities 
 It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because we are unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity, which is driven by our assessment of competing opportunities at the time we enter into transactions. These decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a significant effect on our cash used for investing activities. 
 We expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 to be approximately 5.0 billion to 5.5 billion, which is driven by clean hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel projects such as those being executed in California and Louisiana, United States, as well as Alberta, Canada. We anticipate capital expenditures to be funded with our current cash balance, cash generated from continuing operations, and additional financing activities. 
 As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we have committed capital of approximately 15 billion to projects intended to accelerate the energy transition. These low- and zero-carbon hydrogen and other first mover projects demonstrate our commitment to making investments that will make a meaningful difference on climate issues, allowing us to support our customers sustainability journeys, conserve resources, and care for our employees and communities.

 In fiscal year 2023, cash provided by financing activities was 1,609.6. As further discussed below, the source of cash was primarily attributable to long-term debt proceeds of 3,516.2 as well as an increase in commercial paper and short-term borrowings of 268.2. These cash inflows were partially offset by dividend payments to shareholders of 1,496.6 and payments on long-term debt of 615.4. 
 The long-term debt proceeds included proceeds from our inaugural multi-currency green bonds that were issued during the second quarter in concurrent U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate note offerings with aggregate principal amounts of 600 and 700 million, respectively. Consistent with our Green Finance Framework, we have allocated the net proceeds to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, existing or future projects that are expected to have environmental benefits, including those related to pollution prevention and control, renewable energy generation and procurement, and sustainable aviation fuel. We expect to issue our first allocation report in 2024. Additionally, as further discussed below, the NGHC joint venture borrowed approximately 1.4 billion. These proceeds were partially offset by financing fees of approximately 150, which are reflected within "Other financing activities". Refer to the Credit Facilities section below as well as Note 16, Debt , to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Table of Conte n t s 

 In fiscal year 2022, cash used for financing activities was 1,000.6. The use of cash was primarily driven by dividend payments to shareholders of 1,383.3 and payments on long-term debt of 400.0 for the repayment of a 3.0 Senior Note. These uses of cash were partially offset by long-term debt proceeds and short-term borrowings of 766.2 and 17.9, respectively. 
 Financing and Capital Structure 
 Total debt increased from 7,644.8 as of 30 September 2022 to 10,305.8 as of 30 September 2023, primarily due to non-recourse project financing secured by the NGHC joint venture for construction of the NEOM Green Hydrogen project, issuance of our inaugural green U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes, and an increase in outstanding commercial paper. Total debt includes related party debt of 328.3 and 781.0 as of 30 September 2023 and 30 September 2022, respectively. 
 Various debt agreements to which we are a party include financial covenants and other restrictions, including restrictions pertaining to the ability to create property liens and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. As of 30 September 2023, we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements. 
 2021 Credit Agreement 
 We have a five-year 2.75 billion revolving credit agreement maturing 31 March 2026 with a syndicate of banks (the 2021 Credit Agreement ), under which senior unsecured debt is available to us and certain of our subsidiaries. The 2021 Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity and supports our commercial paper program. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2021 Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2023. At this time, we do not expect to access the facility for additional liquidity. 
 The only financial covenant in the 2021 Credit Agreement is a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization (equal to total debt plus total equity) not to exceed 70 . The 2021 Credit Agreement defines total debt as the aggregate principal amount of all indebtedness, excluding limited recourse debt of any project finance subsidiary. Accordingly, this calculation does not consider borrowings associated with NGHC. Total debt to total capitalization was 36.6 and 35.8 as of 30 September 2023 and 30 September 2022, respectively. 
 Foreign Credit Facilities 
 We also have credit facilities available to certain of our foreign subsidiaries totaling 1,596.8, of which 1,041.4 was borrowed and outstanding as of 30 September 2023. The amount borrowed and outstanding as of 30 September 2022 was 457.5. The increase from 30 September 2022 was driven by borrowings on a new variable-rate Saudi Riyal loan facility that matures in October 2026. The interest rate on the facility is based on the Saudi Arabian Interbank Offered Rate plus an annual margin of 1.35 . We entered into this facility in October 2022 and utilized a portion of the proceeds to repay a variable-rate 4.10 Saudi Riyal Loan Facility of 195.6, which was presented within long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet as of 30 September 2022. 
 NEOM Green Hydrogen Project Financing 
 In May 2023, NGHC secured non-recourse project financing of approximately 6.1 billion, which is expected to fund approximately 73 of the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project and will be drawn over the construction period. At the same time, NGHC secured additional non-recourse credit facilities totaling approximately 500 primarily for working capital needs. As of 30 September 2023, the joint venture had borrowed 1.4 billion of the available financing. Refer to Note 3, Variable Interest Entities , to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Dividends 
 The Board of Directors determines whether to declare cash dividends on our common stock and the timing and amount based on financial condition and other factors it deems relevant. In fiscal year 2023, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend to 1.75 per share, representing an 8 increase, or 0.13 per share, from the previous dividend of 1.62 per share. We expect to continue increasing our quarterly dividend as we have done for the last 41 consecutive years. 
 Dividends are paid quarterly, usually during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. On 21 July 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 1.75 per share that was payable on 13 November 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 2 October 2023. On 15 November 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 1.75 per share that is payable on 12 February 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 2 January 2024. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 In fiscal years 2023 and 2022, cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations of 0.6 and 59.6, respectively, resulted from cash received as part of state tax refunds related to the sale of our former Performance Materials Division in fiscal year 2017.

 PENSION BENEFITS 
 We and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants in 2005, after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees. The shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions. For additional information, refer to Note 17, Retirement Benefits , to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Net Periodic Cost (Benefit) 
 The table below summarizes the components of net periodic cost/benefit for our U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans for the fiscal years ended 30 September: 
 2023 2022 Service cost 23.2 39.8 Non-service related costs (benefits) 
 86.8 (44.7) Other 0.9 1.3 Net Periodic Cost (Benefit) 110.9 3.6) 
 Net periodic cost was 110.9 in fiscal year 2023 versus a benefit of 3.6 in the prior year. The increased costs from the prior year were primarily attributable to higher non-service costs, which were driven by higher interest cost and lower expected returns on plan assets due to a smaller beginning balance of plan assets. The net impact of non-service related items are reflected within "Other non-operating income (expense), net" on our consolidated income statements. 
 Service costs result from benefits earned by active employees and are reflected as operating expenses primarily within "Cost of sales" and "Selling and administrative expense" on our consolidated income statements. The amount of service costs capitalized in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was not material. 
 The table below summarizes the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic cost/benefit for the fiscal years ended 30 September: 
 2023 2022 Weighted average discount rate Service cost 5.1 2.4 Weighted average discount rate Interest cost 5.3 2.0 Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets 5.3 5.1 Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase 3.5 3.4 
 2024 Outlook 
 In fiscal year 2024, we expect to recognize pension expense of approximately 120 to 130 primarily driven by approximately 100 to 110 of non-service related costs, including lower estimated expected returns on plan assets due to a smaller beginning balance of plan assets and higher interest cost, partially offset by a decrease in actuarial loss amortization. 
 In fiscal year 2023, we recognized net actuarial losses of 4.4 in other comprehensive income. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets could impact the actuarial gain or loss and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2024.

Table of Conte n t s 

 Pension Funding 
 Funded Status 
 The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to date, including the effects of estimated future salary increases. The plan funded status is calculated as the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets at the end of the period. 
 The table below summarizes the projected benefit obligation, the fair value of plan assets, and the funded status for our U.S. and international plans as of 30 September: 
 2023 2022 Projected benefit obligation 
 3,511.2 3,588.3 Fair value of plan assets at end of year 
 3,433.0 3,526.0 Plan Funded Status 
 78.2) 62.3) 
 The net unfunded liability of 78.2 as of 30 September 2023 increased 15.9 from 62.3 as of 30 September 2022, as increases to the projected benefit obligation from the service and interest cost components of net period pension cost were greater than actuarial gains from higher discount rates. 
 Company Contributions 
 Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses. 
 In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third-party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2023 and 2022, our cash contributions to funded pension plans and benefit payments for unfunded pension plans were 32.6 and 44.7, respectively. 
 For fiscal year 2024, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be 35 to 45. The estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon the timing of retirements. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies , and Note 2, New Accounting Guidance , to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our major accounting policies and information concerning implementation and impact of new accounting guidance. 
 The accounting policies discussed below are those policies that we consider to be the most critical to understanding our financial statements because they require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current and/or future economic and market conditions and their effect based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. If conditions change, actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. 
 Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment 
 Plant and equipment, net at 30 September 2023 totaled 17,472.1, and depreciation expense totaled 1,325.8 during fiscal year 2023. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. 
 Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location. 
 
 44 

Table of Conte n t s 

 The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially when business circumstances change. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, excessive wear and tear, or unanticipated government actions may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. 
 Our regional segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer s facility. These contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term supply contracts are generally matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the associated production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset. 
 Our regional segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases. The depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors actions, etc. 
 In addition, we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business combination. Depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on the age and condition of the assets, the remaining duration of long-term supply contracts served by the assets, and our historical experience with similar assets. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. 
 Impairment of Assets 
 There were no triggering events in fiscal year 2023 that would require impairment testing for any of our asset groups, reporting units that contain goodwill, or indefinite-lived intangibles assets. We completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded there were no indications of impairment. Refer to the Impairment of Assets subsections below for additional detail. 
 Impairment of Assets: Plant and Equipment 
 Plant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Plant and equipment to be disposed of other than by sale may be reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, such as unexpected contract terminations or unexpected foreign government-imposed restrictions or expropriations. Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include: 
 a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping; 
 a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition; 
 an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset; 
 a reduction in revenues that is other than temporary; 
 a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping; or 
 changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets. 
 If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. 
 45 

Table of Conte n t s 

 The assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. The assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management s best estimates at the time of the impairment review and could include probability weighting of cash flow projections associated with multiple potential future scenarios. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. 
 In fiscal year 2023, there was no need to test for impairment on any of our asset groupings as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of our asset groupings may not be recoverable. 
 Impairment of Assets: Goodwill 
 The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price (plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill was 861.7 as of 30 September 2023. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 11, Goodwill , to the consolidated financial statements. 
 We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. The tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. We have five reportable business segments, seven operating segments and 11 reporting units, eight of which include a goodwill balance. Refer to Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information , for additional information. Reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within our regional industrial gases segments. 
 As part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. However, we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
 To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. Our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. The income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit and/or adjusted EBITDA margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Projected revenue growth rates and operating profit and/or adjusted EBITDA assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and/or revised forecasts and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates. 
 If our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. When the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies and/or regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. When both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. 
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test, noting no indications of impairment. The fair value of all our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. 
 
 46 

Table of Conte n t s 

 Future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: long-term economic weakness, decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, changes in the strategy of the reporting unit, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in impairment charges. 
 Impairment of Assets: Intangible Assets 
 Intangible assets, net with determinable lives at 30 September 2023 totaled 297.5 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. See the impairment discussion above under " Impairment of Assets Plant and Equipment " for a description of how impairment losses are determined. 
 Indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2023 totaled 37.1 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. To determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset. 
 Disclosures related to intangible assets other than goodwill are included in Note 12, Intangible Assets , to the consolidated financial statements. 
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles, noting no indications of impairment. 
 Impairment of Assets: Equity Method Investments 
 Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled 4,617.8 at 30 September 2023. The majority of our equity method investments are ventures with other industrial gas companies. Summarized financial information of our equity affiliates is included in Note 9, Equity Affiliates , to the consolidated financial statements. We review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. 
 An impairment loss is recognized in the event that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the carrying value of an investment occurs. We estimate the fair value of our investments under the income approach, which considers the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee, and/or the market approach, which considers market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gas companies. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. 
 In fiscal year 2023, there was no need to test any of our equity affiliate investments for impairment as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable. 
 Revenue Recognition: Cost Incurred Input Method 
 Revenue from equipment sale contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use. We use a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. 
 Accounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimates of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance, schedule delays, technical issues, cost inflation, labor productivity, the complexity of work performed, the availability of materials, and performance of subcontractors. When adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required, any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such change. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined. 
 47 

Table of Conte n t s 

 In addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of engineering, project procurement, and construction activities, our sale of equipment projects within our Corporate and other segment require monitoring of risks associated with schedule, geography, and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract. 
 Changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method unfavorably impacted operating income by approximately 115 in fiscal year 2023 and 30 in fiscal year 2022. 
 We assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress. Our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our contractual revenues and cost forecasts on these projects. 
 Revenue Recognition: On-site Customer Contracts 
 For customers who require large volumes of gases on a long-term basis, we produce and supply gases under long-term contracts from large facilities that we build, own, and operate on or near the customer s facilities. Certain of these on-site contracts contain complex terms and provisions regarding tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements, variable components, pricing provisions, and amendments, which require significant judgment to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition. 
 Income Taxes 
 We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. As of 30 September 2023, accrued income taxes, including the amount recorded as noncurrent, was 240.6, and net deferred tax liabilities were 1,106.4. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2023 were 96.5, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2023 was 551.2. 
 Management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets. 
 Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments. 
 Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in income tax expense. 
 A 1 increase or decrease in our effective tax rate may result in a decrease or increase to net income, respectively, of approximately 29. 
 Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 23, Income Taxes , to the consolidated financial statements.

 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
 The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions, expense, and obligations associated with the defined benefit plans. 
 Actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern. 
 Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 17, Retirement Benefits , to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the U.S. and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. Mortality rates are based on the most recent U.S. and international mortality tables. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and differences in rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. 
 One of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. We measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. The rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. These rates change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. With respect to impacts on pension benefit obligations, a 50 bp increase or decrease in the discount rate may result in a decrease or increase, respectively, to pension expense of approximately 15 per year. 
 The expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the long-term average rate of return to be earned by plan assets reflecting current asset allocations. In determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets may result in a decrease or increase, respectively, to pension expense of approximately 17 per year. 
 We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. This is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses on equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for non-equity investments equals the actual fair value. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets. 
 The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the expected rate of compensation may result in an increase or decrease to pension expense, respectively, of approximately 4 per year.

 Loss Contingencies 
 In the normal course of business, we encounter contingencies, or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on our company. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. 
 Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements, and details are provided in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions to the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation alternative is identified, or our proportionate share of the liability increases. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded. 
 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital. 
 We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and related major accounting policies, refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies , and Note 14, Financial Instruments , to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases. 
 Our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt, including the current portion and amounts owed to related parties; interest rate swaps; cross currency interest rate swaps; and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the "net financial instrument position" and is disclosed in Note 15, Fair Value Measurements , to the consolidated financial statements. Our net financial instrument position increased from a liability of 6,898.6 at 30 September 2022 to a liability of 8,990.8 at 30 September 2023. The increase was primarily due to NEOM Green Hydrogen Project financing and the issuance of U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes during the fiscal year. 
 The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions as of the valuation date, such as interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatility.

Table of Conte n t s 

 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our debt portfolio as of 30 September 2023, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 80 fixed-rate debt and 20 variable-rate debt. Our debt portfolio as of 30 September 2022, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 79 fixed-rate debt and 21 variable-rate debt. 
 The sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp parallel move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2023, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 728 and 364 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2023 and 2022, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 845 and 425 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional 21 and 16 of interest incurred per year at 30 September 2023 and 2022, respectively. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by 21 and 16 per year at 30 September 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 The sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2023 and 2022, with all other variables held constant. A 10 strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of 308 and 165 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in sensitivity is primarily due to the issuance of Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes during the fiscal year. 
 The primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are the Euro and U.S. Dollar and Chinese Renminbi and U.S. Dollar. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset or liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis. 
 The majority of our sales are denominated in foreign currencies as they are derived outside the United States. Therefore, financial results will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Chinese Renminbi and the Euro represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings. We estimate that a 10 reduction in either the Chinese Renminbi or the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately 55 and 20, respectively.

 MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 Air Products management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting, which is defined in the following sentences, is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 
 (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 
 (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. Our processes contain self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. 
 Management has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that, as of 30 September 2023, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued its opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of 30 September 2023 as stated in its report which appears herein.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated income statements, comprehensive income statements, statements of equity, and statements of cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 54 

Table of Conte n t s 

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Revenue Recognition On-site Customer Contracts Refer to Notes 1 and 6 to the Financial Statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 On-site industrial gas customer contracts involve large capital investments to serve customers who require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand. The Company builds, owns and operates facilities on or near the customer s facilities to produce and supply the customer with gases under a long-term arrangement. Typically, these contracts have 15- to 20-year terms and contain fixed monthly charges and/or minimum purchase requirements. Revenue associated with these contracts is generally recognized over time during the period in which the Company delivers or makes available the agreed upon quantity of gases. In addition, certain on-site industrial gas contracts contain complex terms and provisions such as tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements, pricing provisions, and variable components that are specific to a customer arrangement, including certain contracts with related parties. These arrangements may require greater judgment in determining when contractual requirements have been met, impacting the timing and amount of revenue to be recorded. 
 We identified revenue recognition for certain on-site industrial gas customer contracts with complex terms and provisions as a critical audit matter because of the judgments necessary for management to evaluate these contract terms, including amendments, in order to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized. This required a high degree of auditor judgment when performing procedures to audit management s determination of the amount and timing of revenue recognition and evaluating the results of those procedures. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to revenue recognition for certain on-site industrial gas customer contracts with complex terms and provisions included the following procedures, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of the Company s controls related to the amount and timing of revenue recognition, including controls over the evaluation of complex terms and provisions in certain on-site industrial gas customer contracts. 
 We evaluated the terms included within original customer contracts and related amendments to assess the accounting for provisions such as minimum payment requirements, pricing provisions, settlement terms, and variable components that require management to apply judgment in determining revenue recognition associated with the contract. 
 We evaluated customer transactions and agreed the amount of revenue recognized to underlying contracts, customer invoices, and cash receipts. 
 We inquired of personnel who oversee operations, customer relations, and revenue recognition as to the presence of contract amendments, and interpretation of contract terms. 
 We considered the nature of transactions with related parties and any potential impact on revenue recognition.

 The measurement of environmental liabilities is based on an evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual site and considers factors such as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. An environmental liability related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of the following types of costs: site investigation and testing costs, remediation costs, post-remediation monitoring costs, natural resource damages, and outside legal fees. These liabilities include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that we have reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. They do not consider any claims for recoveries from insurance or other parties and are not discounted. 
 As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the amount of projected cost is reviewed, and the liability is adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. Management has an established process in place to identify and monitor our environmental exposures. An environmental accrual analysis is prepared and maintained that lists all environmental loss contingencies, even where an accrual has not been established. This analysis assists in monitoring our overall environmental exposure and serves as a tool to facilitate ongoing communication among our technical experts, environmental managers, environmental lawyers, and financial management to ensure that required accruals are recorded and potential exposures disclosed. 
 Due to inherent uncertainties involved in evaluating environmental exposures, actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates. Refer to Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies , for additional information on our environmental loss contingencies. 
 The accruals for environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, primarily as part of other noncurrent liabilities.

 billion engineering, procurement, and construction ("EPC") agreement with Air Products named as the main contractor and system integrator for the facility. As of 30 September 2023, we had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately billion for open purchase orders related to construction of the project. 
 Air Products has one-third of the voting interests in the NGHC joint venture; however, substantially all the activities of the joint venture involve or are conducted on behalf of Air Products. Since we have disproportionately few voting rights relative to our economic interests in the joint venture, we determined that NGHC is a variable interest entity. In addition, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of NGHC since we have the power to unilaterally direct certain significant activities, including key design and construction decisions, and we share power with our joint venture partners related to other activities that are significant to the economic performance of NGHC. Therefore, we consolidate NGHC within the Middle East and India segment. 
 Project Financing 
 In May 2023, NGHC secured non-recourse project financing of approximately billion, which is expected to fund about of the project and will be drawn over the construction period. At the same time, NGHC secured additional non-recourse credit facilities totaling approximately primarily for working capital needs. Under the financing, the assets of NGHC can only be used to settle obligations of the joint venture, and creditors of NGHC do not have recourse to the general credit of Air Products.

 We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. The impairment test for goodwill involves calculating the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing that value to the carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as a goodwill impairment charge, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test and determined that the fair value of all our reporting units exceeded their carrying value.

These contracts are used to economically hedge foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily working capital. The primary objective of these forward exchange contracts is to protect the value of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to their receipt or settlement. This portfolio of forward exchange contracts consists of many different foreign currency pairs, with a profile that changes from time to time depending on our business activity and sourcing decisions.

 It is our policy to identify, on a continuing basis, the need for debt capital and to evaluate the financial risks inherent in funding the Company with debt capital. Reflecting the result of this ongoing review, we manage our debt portfolio and hedging program with the intent to (1) reduce funding risk with respect to borrowings made by us to preserve our access to debt capital and provide debt capital as required for funding and liquidity purposes, and (2) manage the aggregate interest rate risk and the debt portfolio in accordance with certain debt management parameters.

 Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features 
 Certain derivative instruments are executed under agreements that require us to maintain a minimum credit rating with both Standard Poor s and Moody s.

The net liability position of derivatives with credit risk-related contingent features was and as of 30 September 2023 and 2022, respectively. Because our current credit rating is above the various pre-established thresholds, collateral has been posted on these liability positions. 
 Counterparty Credit Risk Management 
 We execute financial derivative transactions with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions, all of which are investment grade at this time. Some of our underlying derivative agreements give us the right to require the institution to post collateral if its credit rating falls below the pre-established thresholds with Standard Poor s, Moody s, or Fitch.

 The net actuarial gains and losses represent the actual changes in the estimated obligation and plan assets that have not yet been recognized in the consolidated income statements and are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Actuarial losses arising during fiscal year 2023 are primarily attributable to lower than expected returns on plan assets that were partially offset by higher discount rates. Accumulated actuarial gains and losses that exceed a corridor are amortized over the average remaining service period of active U.S. participants, which was approximately as of 30 September 2023.

 In fiscal year 2023, the expected return for U.S. plan assets was based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets. In determining the estimated long-term asset class returns, we take into account historical long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as other economic and market factors, and input from our actuaries and investment advisors. 
 In fiscal year 2023, the expected rate of return for international plan assets was based on a weighted average return for plans outside the U.S., which vary significantly in size, asset structure and expected returns. The expected asset return for the U.K. plan, which represents approximately of the assets of our International plans, was and was derived from expected equity and debt security returns.

 Other Postretirement Benefits 
 We provide other postretirement benefits consisting primarily of healthcare benefits to certain U.S. retirees who meet age and service requirements. The healthcare benefit is a continued medical benefit until the retiree reaches age 65. Healthcare benefits are contributory, with contributions adjusted periodically. The retiree medical costs are capped at a specified dollar amount, with the retiree contributing the remainder. The cost of these benefits was not material in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021.

This fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Justice, following an investigation beginning in 2003, which alleged violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases. The fines are based on a percentage of our total revenue in Brazil in 2003. 
 We have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in October 2010 with the Brazilian courts. On 6 May 2014, our appeal was granted and the fine against Air Products Brasil Ltda. was dismissed. CADE has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending. We, with advice of our outside legal counsel, have assessed the status of this matter and have concluded that, although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible, such a judgment is not probable. As a result, provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements. In the event of an adverse final judgment, we estimate the maximum possible loss to be the full amount of the fine of R million (approximately at 30 September 2023) plus interest accrued thereon until final disposition of the proceedings. 
 Additionally, in April 2023, we received a favorable ruling from a Texas state court in litigation involving disputed energy management charges related to Winter Storm Uri, a severe winter weather storm that impacted the U.S. Gulf Coast in February 2021.

 sites on which a final settlement or remediation has not been achieved where we, usually along with others, have been designated a potentially responsible party by environmental authorities or are otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation, including cleanup activity at certain of our current and former manufacturing sites. We continually monitor these sites for which we have environmental exposure. 
 Accruals for environmental loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2023 and 30 September 2022 included an accrual of and , respectively, primarily as part of other noncurrent liabilities . The environmental liabilities will be paid over a period of up to . We estimate the exposure for environmental loss contingencies to range from to a reasonably possible upper exposure of as of 30 September 2023. 
 Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Using reasonably possible alternative assumptions of the exposure level could result in an increase to the environmental accrual. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to the reasonably possible upper exposure level could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation alternative is identified, or a significant increase in our proportionate share occurs. We do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year. 
 Pace 
 At 30 September 2023, of the environmental accrual was related to the Pace facility. 
 In 2006, we sold our Amines business, which included operations at Pace, Florida, and recognized a liability for retained environmental obligations associated with remediation activities at Pace. We are required by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection ("FDEP") and the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("USEPA") to continue our remediation efforts. We recognized a before-tax expense of in fiscal year 2006 in results from discontinued operations and recorded an environmental accrual of in continuing operations on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 During the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we completed an updated cost review of the environmental remediation status at the Pace facility. The review was completed in conjunction with requirements to maintain financial assurance per the Consent Order issued by the FDEP discussed below. Based on our review, we expect ongoing activities to continue for 30 years. Additionally, we will require near-term spending to install new groundwater recovery wells and ancillary equipment, in addition to future capital to consider the extended time horizon for remediation at the site. As a result of these changes, we increased our environmental accrual for this site by in continuing operations on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized a before-tax expense of in results from discontinued operations in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. There have been no significant changes to the estimated exposure range related to the Pace facility since the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. 
 We have implemented many of the remedial corrective measures at the Pace facility required under 1995 Consent Orders issued by the FDEP and the USEPA. Contaminated soils have been bioremediated, and the treated soils have been secured in a lined on-site corrective action management unit. Several groundwater recovery systems have been installed to contain and remove contamination from groundwater. We completed an extensive assessment of the site to determine the efficacy of existing measures, what additional corrective measures may be needed, and whether newer remediation technologies that were not available in the 1990s might be suitable to more quickly and effectively remediate groundwater. Based on assessment results, we completed a focused feasibility study that has identified alternative approaches that may more effectively remove contaminants. We continue to review alternative remedial approaches with the FDEP and completed additional field work during 2021 to support the design of an improved groundwater recovery network with the objective of targeting areas of higher contaminant concentration and avoiding areas of high groundwater iron which has proven to be a significant operability issue for the project. The design of the optimized recovery system was initiated in fiscal year 2023 with construction expected to begin in fiscal year 2025. In the first quarter of 2015, we entered into a new Consent Order with the FDEP requiring us to continue our remediation efforts at the Pace facility, along with the completion of a cost review every 5 years.

 of the environmental accrual was related to the Piedmont site. 
 On 30 June 2008, we sold our Elkton, Maryland, and Piedmont, South Carolina, production facilities and the related North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives businesses. In connection with the sale, we recognized a liability for retained environmental obligations associated with remediation activities at the Piedmont site. This site is under active remediation for contamination caused by an insolvent prior owner. 
 We are required by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control ("SCDHEC") to address both contaminated soil and groundwater. Numerous areas of soil contamination have been addressed, and contaminated groundwater is being recovered and treated. The SCDHEC issued its final approval to the site-wide feasibility study on 13 June 2017 and the Record of Decision for the site on 27 June 2018, after which we signed a Consent Agreement Amendment memorializing our obligations to complete the cleanup of the site. Remediation has started in accordance with the design, which includes in-situ chemical oxidation treatment, as well as soil vapor extraction to remove volatile organic compounds from the unsaturated soils beneath the impacted areas of the plant. We estimate that source area remediation and groundwater recovery and treatment will continue through 2029. Thereafter, we expect this site to go into a state of monitored natural attenuation through 2047. 
 We recognized a before-tax expense of in 2008 as a component of income from discontinued operations and recorded an environmental liability of in continuing operations on the consolidated balance sheets. There have been no significant changes to the estimated exposure. 
 Pasadena 
 At 30 September 2023, of the environmental accrual was related to the Pasadena site. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2012, management committed to permanently shutting down our polyurethane intermediates ("PUI") production facility in Pasadena, Texas. In shutting down and dismantling the facility, we have undertaken certain obligations related to soil and groundwater contaminants. We have been pumping and treating groundwater to control off-site contaminant migration in compliance with regulatory requirements and under the approval of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ("TCEQ"). We estimate that the pump and treat system will continue to operate until 2042. 
 We continue to perform additional work to address other environmental obligations at the site. This additional work includes remediating, as required, impacted soils, investigating groundwater west of the former PUI facility, continuing post closure care for two closed RCRA surface impoundment units, and maintaining engineering controls. Additionally, we have conducted an interim corrective action to treat impacted soils as recommended in the TCEQ 2019 Annual Report. In 2012, we estimated the total exposure at this site to be . There have been no significant changes to the estimated exposure. 
 Asset Retirement Obligations 
 Our asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with long-term on-site supply contracts under which we have built a facility on land owned by the customer and are obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. The retirement of assets includes the contractually required removal of a long-lived asset from service and encompasses the sale, removal, abandonment, recycling, or disposal of the assets as required at the end of the contract term. These obligations are primarily reflected within "Other noncurrent liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets. The timing and/or method of settlement of these obligations are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within our control.

 equity contributions or payments have been made since the inception of the guarantees discussed below. The fair value of these guarantees is not material. 
 We issued performance guarantees as a condition of project financing associated with the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project that would require us to pay up to approximately billion in the event of nonperformance in our role as EPC contractor. Our exposure will decline over time before expiring in November 2028. Refer to Note 3, Variable Interest Entities, for additional information regarding the project. 
 We are party to an equity support agreement and operations guarantee related to an air separation facility constructed in Trinidad for a venture in which we own . At 30 September 2023, maximum potential payments under joint and several guarantees were . Exposures under the guarantees will be completely extinguished by 2024. 
 We also have a long-term sale of equipment contract with the JIGPC joint venture to engineer, procure, and construct the industrial gas facilities that will supply gases to Aramco. We provided bank guarantees to the joint venture to support our performance under the contract. As of 30 September 2023, our maximum potential payments were . 
 Unconditional Purchase Obligations 
 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total 
 Approximately billion of our unconditional purchase obligations relate to open purchase orders for plant and equipment, of which approximately billion relates to the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to reschedule, cancel, or otherwise modify based on our business needs. We have estimated the timing of these payments in the table above; however, timing of actual satisfaction of the obligations may vary. 
 Approximately billion of our unconditional purchase obligations relate to helium and rare gases. The majority of these obligations occur after fiscal year 2028. Helium purchases include crude feedstock supply to helium refining plants in North America as well as refined helium purchases from sources around the world. As a rare byproduct of natural gas production in the energy sector, these helium sourcing agreements are medium- to long-term and contain take-if-tendered provisions. The refined helium is distributed globally and sold as a merchant gas, primarily under medium-term requirements contracts. While contract terms in our helium sourcing contracts are generally longer than our customer sales contracts, helium is a rare gas used in applications with few or no substitutions because of its unique physical and chemical properties. 
 Our unconditional purchase obligations also include commitments for power and natural gas supply as well as feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. Our long-term sales contracts to customers are generally matched to the term of these obligations and provide recovery of price increases. As a result, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

 Deferred Stock Units 
 We have granted deferred stock units to executives, selected employees, and outside directors. These deferred stock units entitle the recipient to one share of common stock upon vesting, which is conditioned, for employee recipients, on continued employment during the deferral period and may be conditioned on achieving certain performance targets. We grant deferred stock unit awards with a two - to five -year deferral period that are subject to payout upon death, disability, or retirement. Deferred stock units issued to outside directors are paid after service on the Board of Directors ends at the time elected by the director (not to exceed after service ends). We generally expense the grant-date fair value of these awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period; however, expense recognition is accelerated for retirement eligible individuals who meet the requirements for vesting upon retirement. We have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than to estimate them. Forfeitures have not been significant historically.

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are included within the consolidated balance sheets as follows: 
 2023 2022 Deferred Tax Assets Other noncurrent assets Deferred Tax Liabilities Deferred income taxes Net Deferred Income Tax Liability 
 Deferred tax liabilities related to "Intangible assets" decreased primarily due to the impact of capitalizing research and development expenditures for U.S tax purposes. Deferred tax liabilities related to "Plant and equipment" increased due to the impact of accelerated tax depreciation deductions in excess of book depreciation, primarily in the United States. The increase was partially offset with book charges in excess of tax related to our business and asset actions that included certain costs for which we could not recognize an income tax benefit and were subject to a valuation allowance. 
 Deferred tax assets for "Tax loss carryforwards" increased primarily due to losses in certain Chinese subsidiaries. A portion of these losses were subject to a valuation allowance for which we could not recognize an income tax benefit. The deferred tax components for "Reserves and accruals" and "Other" were impacted by changes in tax deferred deductions and the timing of revenue recognition for local tax and accounting purposes.

Exhibit 4.3 
 
 AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. 
 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES REGISTERED 
 UNDER SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

 Description of Common Stock 
 
 The following is a description of the general terms of the shares of our common stock. This description does not include all of the terms of our common stock and should be read together with our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (our Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (our Bylaws ), each of which are incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit is a part, and applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL ). We encourage you to read our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, for additional information. 
 
 General 
 
 We are authorized to issue up to 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 1.00 per share common stock ), and up to 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 1.00 per share. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol APD. 
 
 Voting 
 
 Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all matters requiring a vote of the stockholders. A majority of the votes cast is required for stockholders to elect directors in uncontested elections, while in contested elections directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast. All other matters put to a stockholder vote generally require the approval of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on the matter and present in person or represented by proxy. Stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 Holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends, in cash, securities, or property, as may from time to time be declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding preferred stock. 
 
 Rights Upon Liquidation 
 
 In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, the holders of common stock will be entitled to share equally in our assets available for distribution after payment in full of all debts and after the holders of any outstanding preferred stock have received their liquidation preferences (including accrued and unpaid dividends) in full. 
 
 Statutory Provisions 
 
 Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a defined set of transactions between a Delaware corporation and an interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is generally defined as a person who, together with any affiliates or associates of such person, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 15 or more of the outstanding voting shares of a corporation. This provision may prohibit business combinations between an interested stockholder and a corporation for a period of three years after the date the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. The term business combination is broadly defined to include mergers, consolidations, sales or other dispositions of assets of the corporation or of any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary which assets have an aggregate market value equal to 10 or more of either the aggregate market value of all the assets of the corporation determined on a consolidated basis or the aggregate market value of all the outstanding stock of the corporation, and some other transactions that would increase the interested stockholder s proportionate share ownership in the corporation. 
 
 This prohibition is effective unless 
 
 the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by the corporation s board of directors prior to the time the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
 
 the interested stockholder acquired at least 85 of the voting stock of the corporation, other than stock held by directors who are also officers or by qualified employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer, in the transaction in which it becomes an interested stockholder or 

the business combination is approved by a majority of the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2 3 of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. 
 
 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions 
 
 Vacancies, and newly-created directorships resulting from any increase in the size of our board, may be filled by a majority vote of all remaining directors, even if the directors then on the board do not constitute a quorum or only one director is left in office. In addition, the board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. These provisions, together with the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL (as discussed above), could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or the removal of existing management, of deterring potential acquirers from making an offer to our stockholders and of limiting any opportunity to realize premiums over prevailing market prices for our common stock in connection therewith. This could be the case even if a majority of our stockholders could benefit from such a change in control or offer.

 As discussed above, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, in one or more classes or series. Undesignated preferred stock may enable our board of directors to render it more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a tender offer, proxy contest, merger or otherwise, and to thereby protect the continuity of our management. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock. For example, any preferred stock issued may rank prior to our common stock as to dividend rights, liquidation preference or both, may have full or limited voting rights and may be convertible into shares of common stock. As a result, the issuance of shares of preferred stock may discourage bids for our common stock or may otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock or any existing preferred stock. In some instances the preferred stock could be issued and have the effect of preventing a merger, tender offer or other takeover attempt that our board of directors opposes.

 The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of our common stock are subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock which we may issue.

 However, upon the occurrence of certain conditions specified in the applicable Indenture, past events of default may be waived by the holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the affected securities, except for defaults in the payment of principal of, or any premium or interest on, such Notes or with respect to any covenant or provision which may not be amended without the approval of each holder affected.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may determine not to pursue the forfeiture and or recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation from any person if the Committee determines that such forfeiture and or recovery would be impracticable due to any of the following circumstances (i) the direct expense paid to a third party (for example, reasonable legal expenses and consulting fees) to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered (following a reasonable attempt by the Company Group to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the documentation of such attempt(s), and the provision of such documentation to the NYSE), or (ii) recovery would likely cause any otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of Company Group, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.

 No person shall be indemnified, insured or reimbursed by the Company Group in respect of any loss of compensation by such person in accordance with this Policy, nor shall any person receive any advancement of expenses for disputes related to any loss of compensation by such person in accordance with this Policy, and no person shall be paid or reimbursed by the Company Group for any premiums paid by such person for any third-party insurance policy covering potential recovery obligations under this Policy. For this purpose, indemnification includes any modification to current compensation arrangements or other means that would amount to de facto indemnification (for example, providing the person a new cash award which would be cancelled to effect the recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation). In no event shall the Company Group be required to award any person an additional payment if any Restatement would result in a higher incentive compensation payment. 
 5. Miscellaneous 
 This Policy generally will be administered and interpreted by the Committee, provided that the Board may, from time to time, exercise discretion to administer and interpret this Policy, in which case, all references herein to Committee shall be deemed to refer to the Board. Any determination by the Committee with respect to this Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all interested parties. Any discretionary determinations of the Committee under this Policy, if any, need not be uniform with respect to all persons, and may be made selectively amongst persons, whether or not such persons are similarly situated. Each Executive Officer shall be required to execute the acknowledgement in Exhibit B of this Policy as soon as practicable, but no later than thirty (30) days, after the date on which the employee is designated as an Executive Officer provided , however , that failure to execute such acknowledgement shall have no impact on the enforceability of this Policy. 
 This Policy is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as it may be amended from time to time, and any related rules or regulations promulgated by the SEC or the NYSE, including any additional or new requirements that become effective after the Effective Date which upon effectiveness shall be deemed to automatically amend this Policy to the extent necessary to comply with such additional or new requirements. 
 
 The provisions in this Policy are intended to be applied to the fullest extent of the law. To the extent that any provision of this Policy is found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be applied to the maximum extent permitted and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Policy shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Policy. Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy is not dependent upon the Company Group satisfying any conditions in this Policy, including any requirements to provide applicable documentation to the NYSE. 
 The rights of the Company Group under this Policy to seek forfeiture or reimbursement are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights of recoupment, or remedies or rights other than recoupment, that may be available to the Company Group pursuant to the terms of any law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement, the Company s Compensation Recoupment Policy or any other policy, code of conduct, employee handbook, employment agreement, equity award agreement, or other plan or agreement of the Company Group. 
 6. Amendment and Termination 
 To the extent permitted by, and in a manner consistent with applicable law, including SEC and NYSE rules, the Committee may terminate, suspend or amend this Policy at any time in its discretion.
