statements. The Registrant has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations and projections about future events.
These forward- looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about the Registrant that may
cause its actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels

The
Company, f/k/a HIPSO Multimedia, Inc., a Florida corporation, was incorporated in April 2005. The Company entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement on November 30, 2011, providing for the acquisition of intellectual property rights comprised of an Internet and mobile service
platform whose purpose is to empower or capitalize on the growth of the neighborhood, local economy (the Buildablock Assets ). 

Effective
March 7, 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of the Buildablock Assets. In connection with the completion of the acquisition,
the Company effected a reverse st ck split oft e Company s outstanding shares of common stock, par value 0.00001, on a one-for-eight
(1:8) basis (which occurred on March 7, 2012) and issued an aggregate of 8,755,484 shares of common s to ck effective March 7, 2012,
representing 50 of the Company s then-outstandmg shares, after givmg effect to the one-for-eight reverse stock split and issuance
of the shares. 

Upon
the closing of the transaction, Gary Oberman and Bartek Bulzak were elected to the Company s Board of Directors, Mr. Oberman was
appointed President and Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Bulzak was appointed Chief Technology Officer. 

Effective
February 24, 2012, the name of the Company was changed to Buildablock Corp. 

Business 

Summary .
Buildablock.com is an Internet service platform whose mission is to act as a transactional catalyst between buyers and sellers while
leveraging a growing collection of patented, sophisticated user friendly tools. Growing beyond the scope of aggregation sites or group
buying catalogs, Buildablock.com offers consumers maximum value for their purchasing dollar by combining group buying leverage, social
media interactivity and automated negotiating tools. Buildablock.com s dashboard of buying tools and follow-on services represent
a new paradigm in supply chain interaction for both retailers and consumers alike. The Company expects that ease of customer acquisition
and diverse, recurring revenue streams will combine to return exceptional value to the Company s shareholders. 

Recent
Activities. In January 2013, the Company launched its e-commerce website, Buildablock.com and the site is now live and fully integrated. 

In
the Company s press release announcing the launch, the Company s CEO, Gary Oberman, stated, we are excited by the
live launch of our e-commerce website. We believe that group buying using the Buildablock platform is the wave of the future since it
provides for negotiated discounting and user empowerment since it is the customer that chooses products for discounting by just uploading
them onto our site. As just one example of how our economies of scale work, by consolidating large blocks of fuel buyers that number
in the thousands, the Buildablock platform can approach large fuel providers to negotiate fleet pricing for its members. This is a very
compelling application of our business model that can provide the opportunity for Buildablock users to save money on gas. 

This
press release further stated that the Company had progressed into the marketing phase where initiatives will include merchant awareness
programs and buyer incentive campaigns. One such program is its joint venture relationship with Linen Chest, Canada s leading retailer
in home fashion, with over 28 stores. Linen Chest is a very strong Canadian brand with an emerging digital presence that had been looking
for an online solution to help drive traffic to its physical stores and increase online sales without the need for deep discounting. 

Sheldon
Liebner, President of the Linen Chest, was quoted in the Company s press release, stating, Buildablock s unique group
bidding methodology ensures maximum traffic through negotiated price management. We had entertained doing business with fixed discounters
like Groupon, but found very little user engagement during the sales process, which limits customer loyalty. With Buildablock, our view
is that the user experience will be very engaging, which will maintain maximum value to both the buyer and the seller alike. Buildablock
users completed several transactions with Linen Chest in the early phase of its live launch, which was easily facilitated and which Linen
Chest reports drove new traffic to both its website and physical stores. Buildablock is the only platform we found that delivers high
quality, free advertising without degrading our brand. This is very encouraging news for our firm as we transition our way across the
digital landscape . 

3 

From
this alliance with Linen Chest, the Company was able to obtain essential user feedback through its soft launch in order to finalize systems
and procedures and prepare for its live launch. Buildablock is now focused upon increasing its shopper population through various programs
and initiatives. Since Buildablock s social login requirement is similar to that of other leading social networking sites, the
Company expects to gain exposure to the friends networks of new subscribers it gained via marketing efforts already undertaken, which
could lead to over 400,000 potential new subscribers by way of referral. 

The
Company views the social networking element as a key to enhancing the shopper experience and expects to go live with its mobile application
in the near future. The Company is intent on increasing the consumer and merchant adoption of the Buildablock platform and remains confident
in its ultimate success of its vibrant and exciting e-commerce platform. 

A
Unique Shopping Platform. Buildablock.com is an online shopping platform that revolutionizes conventional online shopping. The site
brings together great ideas, such as group discounts, wish lists, online negotiations, and more, into a unique venue that empowers consumers
to save on the items they want from the merchants they choose. 

When
a Buildablock.com user finds an item he or she likes, whether online or in a retail store, the Buildablock.com user simply posts basic
details about it on Buildablock.com and shares the information on social media. The Company calls that action a Wink . Then,
others with the same interest can join the Wink to form a buyer group. Once a certain number of buyers have joined the Wink, Buildablock.com
automatically opens a negotiation with the merchant to win a substantial discount for everyone in the buyer group. 

The
Buildablock Advantage. Buildablock.com is capable of saving users money when it comes to buying the things users really want to purchase.
While arranging terrific deals for users will always be Buildablock.com s primary objective, Buildablock.com is not one-dimensional.
Rather, Buildablock.com empowers both shoppers and merchants, by acting as a mediator between shoppers and merchants.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS Back to Table of Contents 

Investing
in our common stock will provide an investor with an equity ownership interest. Shareholders will be subject to risks inherent in our
business. The performance of our shares will reflect the performance of our business relative to, among other things, general economic
and industry conditions, market conditions and competition. The value of the investment may increase or decrease and could result in
a loss. An investor should carefully consider the following factors as well as other information contained in this annual report on Form
10-K for the year ended November 30, 2012. 

This
annual report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ
materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including the risk factors described
below and the other factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 

Risk
factors related to our business 

With
the disposition of Valtech, the Company commenced operating in the development stage as it develops its purchased intellectual property.
The Company has no revenues and nominal assets other than cash which was raised during May 2012 as part of a private placement. New management
has had some preliminary discussions regarding further capitalization of the Company. These plans include the raising of capital through
the equity markets to fund future operations and generating adequate revenues for the new business of the Company. Even if the Company
raises sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generates revenues, there can be no assurance that the revenues will
be sufficient to enable it to develop business to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations. These matters
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. However, the accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded
assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
new and retain existing customers, generate and sustain a revenue base sufficient to meet operating expenses, and achieve profitability,
if ever. 

Our
auditor has raised doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company has lost money in every quarter since the inception of its business. As of November 30, 2012, our accumulated loss was 1,884,979.
In April 2012, the related party loans with the four principal shareholders of the Company were assumed by Valtech, upon the sale back
to Valtech along with the accrued interest on those loans. Currently there is a 0 balance due those shareholders. The amount outstanding
prior to the sale was 1,928,319. The loans did bear interest at an annual rate of 10 for individual amounts exceeding 150,000 (CDN ).
Interest expense for the years ended November 30, 2012 and 2011 were 35,361 and 97,401, respectively, and are reflected in operations
from discontinued operations. Accrued interest on these loans prior to the sale was 329,395. The accrued interest along with the notes
were sold in April 2012, and the balance is 0 as of November 30, 2012. 

The
Company may not be successful in implementing its business plan. 

While
the Company s business model and strategy of offering triple play Telecommunications Services is similar to those
being utilized by many existing providers of telecommunication services, the Company may not be successful, for many reasons, including
but not limited to insufficient resources to compete in its present market or in expanded markets in Canada or elsewhere. If the assumptions
underlying the business model are not valid or if the Company is unable to implement the business plan, achieve predicted levels of market
penetration or obtain the desired level of pricing of services for sustained periods, the Company may not be successful. The Company
focuses on selling directly to consumers and through hotels and apartment buildings. It may never be able to achieve significant market
acceptance, favorable operating results or profitability. 

The
Company has a concentration of credit risk. 

On
August 31, 2011, 6,372, or 76 of the Company s accounts receivable was with three customers. In addition, there was one customer
who represented approximately 66 of the revenue for the nine months ended August 31, 2011. This customer is considered a major customer
of the Company. 

The
Company expects that its losses will continue for the foreseeable future. 

The
Company has incurred losses and experienced negative cash flow from operations since it commenced its Telecommunications Services business.
It expects to continue to incur significant losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future. If revenue does
not grow as it expects or if its ability to raise capital is insufficient or operating expenditures exceed its expectations, then the
Company s business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will face materially adverse effects. 

5 

Competitive
forces may result in the decrease of the price for the Company s Telecommunication Services. 

Prices
for communications services have historically decreased over time. The Company expects that prices for its Telecommunications Services
may decrease after the market for such services becomes saturated. While the Company believes that the market for Telecommunication Services
shall continue to grow, the Company cannot predict with any certainty the number of years before which saturation occurs. At such time
that market saturation occurs, the Company may have to reduce prices in order to remain competitive. The inability to sell its Telecommunication
Services at desired pricing levels would significantly impair its ability to achieve profitability. 

The
actual amount and timing of future capital requirements will depend upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to: 

- 
 the
 number of new markets it enters and the timing of entry; 
 
 - 
 the
 rate and price at which customers purchase services; 
 
 - 
 the
 level of marketing required to attract and retain customers; and 
 
 - 
 opportunities
 to invest in or acquire complementary businesses. 

Failure
to manage growth could have a detrimental effect on the Company s business. 

The
Company anticipates that the number and rate of installations for new customers will continue to increase provided that the Company is
able to raise sufficient capital. However, rapid growth would place a significant strain on the Company s management, financial
controls, operations, personnel and other resources. If the Company fails to manage its anticipated rapid growth, its business could
be materially adversely affected. If the Company is unable to provide its existing customers with adequate service and if it does not
institute adequate financial and reporting systems, managerial controls and procedures, its financial condition will be adversely affected.
It is currently implementing operational support systems to bill customers, process customer orders and coordinate with vendors and contractors.
To manage growth effectively, it must successfully implement these systems on a timely basis and continually expand and upgrade these
systems as our operations expand. 

The
Company s success depends in large part on its retention of executive officers. 

The
Company is managed by a small number of executive officers. Competition for qualified executives in the telecommunications industry is
intense, and there are a limited number of persons with comparable experience. The Company depends upon its executive officers, and,
in particular, Rene Arbic, President and Chief Executive Officer, to execute its business strategy and manage employees. While Company
does not have employment agreements with nor does it have key person life insurance policies on any of its executive officers,
Rene Arbic has an employment agreement with Valtech, the Company s operating subsidiary. The loss of these key individuals would
have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. 

If
the Company fails to recruit and hire qualified personnel in a timely manner or to retain its employees, it will not be able to execute
its business strategy. 

The
Company s strategy is to continue expanding its presence in Montreal and in Quebec Province. It also plans to expand its service
areas to other provinces in Canada. In order to execute this strategy, it must identify, hire, train and retain highly qualified technical,
sales, marketing and customer service personnel. If it cannot hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, it will not
be able to expand as planned. The Company may be unable to identify, hire or retain employees with experience in the telecommunications
industry. Any failure to attract suitable employees would adversely affect its business. 

The
Company may make acquisitions of complementary businesses in the future which may disrupt its business and be dilutive to existing shareholders. 

The
Company intends to consider acquisitions of businesses in the future. Acquisitions of businesses and technologies involve numerous risks,
including the diversion of the attention of management, difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations, loss of key employees from
the acquired company and difficulties in transitioning key customer relationships. In addition, acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances
of equity securities, the incurrence of additional debt, large one-time expenses and the creation of goodwill or other intangible assets
that result in significant amortization expense. Any of these factors could materially harm the Company s business or operating
results. 

The
Company s quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly, causing its stock price to be volatile. 

The
Company cannot accurately forecast quarterly revenue and operating results, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.
If quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of its common stock
could fall substantially. Its quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which
are outside our control, including: 

- 
 the
 amount and timing of expenditures relating to the rollout of services; 
 
 - 
 the
 rate at which it is able to attract and retain customers; 
 
 - 
 the
 availability of future financing to continue expansion; 
 
 - 
 technical
 difficulties; 
 
 - 
 the
 introduction of new services or technologies by our competitors and 
 
 - 
 pressures
 on the pricing of services. 

6 

The
Company s principal shareholders and management own a significant percentage of its capital stock and are able to exercise significant
influence over the Company. 

The
Company s executive officers and directors and principal shareholders together beneficially own a majority of the total common
stock of the Company. Accordingly, these stockholders, as a group, will be able to determine the composition of the board of directors
and will retain the power to approve all matters requiring shareholder approval and will continue to have significant influence over
the Company s affairs. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the
Company or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of our company, which in turn could have a material
and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices
for their shares of common stock. 

Risk
factors related to the market for our common stock 

There
is no assurance that an active trading market will be sustained for our common stock. 

Our
common stock became eligible for quotation on the FINRA OTCBB under the symbol HPSO on August 8, 2008. Further, there can
be no assurance regarding the market price of our shares. In addition, the liquidity of any trading market in our common stock, and the
market price quoted for the shares of common stock, may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for securities generally
and by changes in our financial performance or prospects for companies in our industry generally. As a result, you cannot be sure that
an active trading market will develop or be sustained for our shares. 

State
blue sky registration; potential limitations on resale of our securities. 

It
is the intention of the management to seek coverage and publication of information regarding the Company in an accepted publication which
permits a manual exemption. This manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without being registered
if the Company issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state. However, it is not
enough for the security to be listed in a recognized manual. The listing entry must contain (1) the names of issuers, officers, and directors,
(2) an issuer s balance sheet, and (3) a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for
the most recent fiscal year of operations. Furthermore, the manual exemption is a nonissuer exemption restricted to secondary trading
transactions, making it unavailable for issuers selling newly issued securities. 

Most
of the accepted manuals are those published in Standard and Poor s, Moody s Investor Service, Fitch s Investment Service,
and Best s Insurance Reports, and many states expressly recognize these manuals. A smaller number of states declare that they recognize
securities manuals but do not specify the recognized manuals. The following states do not have any provisions and therefore do
not expressly recognize the manual exemption: Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont
and Wisconsin. 

Dividends
unlikely. 

We
do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends, if any, will be contingent upon our future revenues
and earnings, capital requirements and general financial condition. The payment of any dividends will be within the discretion of our
board of directors. It is our intention to retain all earnings for use in the business operations and accordingly, we do not anticipate
that the Company will declare any dividends in the foreseeable future. 

Possible
Issuance of Additional Securities. 

Our
Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.00001. As of November 30, 2012,
we had 23,937,979 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. We may issue additional shares of common stock in connection with any
financing activities, as compensation for services or in connection with any future acquisitions. To the extent that additional shares
of common stock are issued, our shareholders would experience dilution of their respective ownership interests in the Company. The issuance
of additional shares of common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise
additional capital through the sale of our equity securities. 

Compliance
with Penny Stock Rules. 

Our
securities are considered a penny stock as defined in the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, since the price of our
shares of common stock is less than 5. Unless our common stock will otherwise be excluded from the definition of penny stock, 
the penny stock rules apply with respect to our common stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer prior to a transaction in
penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC that provides
information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer
with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its sales person in the transaction,
and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. In addition, the penny
stock rules require that the broker-dealer, not otherwise exempt from such rules, must make a special written determination that the
penny stock is suitable for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure rules
have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock
rules. So long as the common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, it may become more difficult to sell such securities. Such requirements,
if applicable, could additionally limit the level of trading activity for our common stock and could make it more difficult for investors
to sell our common stock.

3. LEGAL PROCEEDING Back to Table of Contents 

On
April 7, 2008, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Thomas Klein and Arshad Shaw (the Consultants ), pursuant
to which each Consultant was issued 300,000 restricted shares of the Company s common stock, granted options to purchase 500,000
shares and options to purchase additional shares during the period commencing May 1, 2008 through October 1, 2008. As a result of the
failure of Consultants to provide the services required under the consulting agreement, the Company terminated the consulting agreement
on August 28, 2008. 

The
Company commenced a lawsuit against the Consultants and the former transfer agent for its common stock and filed an amended complaint
on February 3, 2009, alleging, among other things, non-performance by the Consultants of their obligations under the consulting agreement
and their failure to pay for the initial 500,000 options that each exercised. 

On
August 30, 2009, the Court entered a default judgment against the defendants which provide for an injunction against the transfer agent
ordering it not to lift restrictions on the certificates evidencing the 300,000 restricted shares of common stock issued to and the 500,000
shares underlying the options granted to each Consultant. On January 26, 2011, the successor transfer agent cancelled the restricted
shares in the Consultants names. On March 1, 2011, attorneys for the Consultants filed a motion seeking legal fess from the Company
not to exceed 

 1,762.50. 

The
Company is not a party to any other litigation and does not believe that any litigation is pending or threatened.

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report.
The following discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ
materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include,
but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the section entitled Risk Factors .

Overview 

In
June 2008, we acquired our wholly-owned subsidiary, Valtech Communications Inc. Valtech in a reverse merger transaction,
issuing 40 million restricted shares to the Valtech shareholders. 

Valtech
offers low-cost, highly reliable triple-play service of Digital Phone, Digital Voice, High-Speed Internet and Digital TV backed by fast,
friendly and live customer service Telecommunication Services ). Our present plan is to expand our bundled services by
providing an end-to- end IPTV solution consisting of IPTV middleware, video on demand, network based PVR, IPTV head ends, content protection,
IPTV infrastructure, system integration and IPTV applications such as games. In order to expand our services to include end-to-end IPTV
service, the Company is dependent upon its ability to raise sufficient capital to fund its agreement with Ericsson. To date, the Company
has been unable to meet its obligations under the Ericsson agreement and at present no agreement with Ericsson has been negotiated and
no negotiations with Ericsson are on-going. 

We
intend to use our limited resources to market our services to new residential and commercial building complexes and existing hotel chains.
Further, we intend to market our bundled Telecommunication Services in industry publications and intend to develop our website and promote
its presence in order to increase web traffic and possible sales to new clients (www.valtech.ca). 

Our
management believes that the trend in our business is toward greater convergence to high speed Internet and high definition television.
We believe that our bundled Telecommunication Services are competitive in terms of reliability and pricing as compared to the services
offered by incumbent operators. Since we have no patent protection, it is possible that a well-funded company could enter the field and
diminish our prospective business growth. We face uncertainties regarding our future growth because we must compete on price and quality
of service with traditional communications companies with far longer operating histories, more established customer relationships, greater
financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases and greater brand or name recognition. Furthermore, companies that
may seek to enter our markets may expose us to severe price competition and future technological developments could make us less competitive. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all highly liquid fixed income investments with maturities of three months or less, to
be cash equivalents. On November 30, 2012, the Company had 362,007 in cash and cash equivalents. At November 30, 2011, the company had
 0 in cash. 

Accounts
Receivable. Management periodically reviews the current status of existing receivables and management s evaluation of periodic
aging of accounts. The Company accounts receivable for the years ended November 30, 2012 and 2011 were 0 and 26,147 an respectively. 

Deferred
Costs. Deferred costs as of November 30, 2012 and 2011, are reflected in assets held under discontinued operations. There was 0
and 71,100 charged to operations for amortization expense for the year ended November 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which are
reflected in discontinued operations. 

Revenue
Recognition. Through April 30, 2012, the Company through Valtech received revenue from subscribers to its triple play network in
which it provided digital TV, voice over internet protocol (VoIP), and high speed internet access, all via fiber optic cable. The Company
billed its subscribers on a monthly basis and recognized the monthly revenue based upon the specific plan selected by the subscriber.
The Company additionally provided contracted services to wire commercial buildings with fiber optic cable in order to provide for similar
services. Valtech was sold on April 30, 2012. For reporting periods ended after April 30, 2012, revenues for Valtech are reported net
of operating expenses as gain or loss from discontinued operations. 

Buildablock
is a development stage company and has not yet recorded any revenues. Buildablock plans to recognize revenue from sales when the following
criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and
collectability is reasonably assured. 

Fixed
Assets: Fixed assets as of November 30, 2012 and 2011, are reflected in assets held under discontinued operations. There was 0
and 4,997 charged to operations for depreciation expense for the years ended November 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which are
reflected in discontinued operations. 

Results
of Operations. 

Comparison
of the years ended November 30, 2012 and 2011 

Revenues:
 Our revenues for the year ended November 30, 2012 were 0 compared to 134,422for year ended November 30, 2011. The Company s
revenues decreased by 143,422, which represents a 100 decrease from the prior year. The Company s decrease in revenues is mainly
attributable to the sale of Valtech. 

Cost
of Sales: Cost of Sales for the year ended November 30, 2012 was 0 compared to 301,379 for year ended November 30, 2011. The Company s
cost of sales decrease was 301,379, which represents a 100 decrease from prior year. Thus, the decrease in the cost of sales was directly
related to the decrease in wirings and installations as well as equipment. 

Depreciation
and Amortization: For the year ended November 30, 2012 we recorded 0 in depreciation and amortization expenses compared to
 132,490 during the year ended November 30, 2011. 

General
and Administrative Expenses: General and Administrative Expenses for the year ended November 30, 2012 was 1,121,464 compared to
 429,616 for year ended November 30, 2011. The Company s general and administrative expenses increase was 691,848, which
represents a 161 increase from the prior year mainly due to increased non-cash compensation expenses. 

11 

Interest
Expense: The Company s interest expense for the year ended November 30, 2012 was 0 compared to 131,402 for year ended November
30, 2010. The decrease of 131,402 were due to the fact that the related party loans with the four principal shareholders of the Company
were assumed by Valtech, upon the sale back to Valtech along with the accrued interest on those loans. Currently there is a 0 balance
due those shareholders. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

During
the year ended November 30, 2012, our net cash increased by 362,007. During the year ended November 30, 2012 and 2011, net cash used
in operating activities was 1,083,641and 388,545, respectively. This cash was used to fund our operations for the periods, adjusted
for non-cash expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities. 

We
had no investing activities in the years ended November 30, 2012 and 2011.

cash provided by financing activities was (1,486,449) during the year ended November 30, 2012 compared to 355,851 net cash provided
by financing activities during the year ended November 30, 2011. The net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended November
30, 2012 resulted from proceeds of 1,486,730 related to the issuance of stoc. The net cash provided by financing activities for the
year ended November 30, 2011 resulted from proceeds of 355,851 related to the issuance of stock. 

The
Company has only limited capital. Additional financing is necessary for the Company to continue as a going concern. 

Our
continued operations will depend on whether we are able to raise additional funds through third parties, such as equity and debt financing,
as well as additional loans from our affiliated shareholders. However, there can be no assurance that such additional funds will be available
on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance that any additional funding that we do obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs
in the long term. We will continue to fund operations from cash on hand and through the similar sources of capital previously described.
We can give no assurances that any additional capital that we are able to obtain will be sufficient to fully fund our growth plan. 

Current
and Future Financing Needs 

We
have incurred an accumulated deficit of 1,884,979 through November 30, 2012. We have incurred negative cash flow from operations since
we started our Telecommunication Services business. We may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts than we currently
anticipate. Potential sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales of our shares or debt and other sources.
We may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long-term capital requirements. We
do not have any committed sources of financing at this time, and it is uncertain whether additional funding will be available when we
need it on terms that will be acceptable to us, or at all. If we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities
convertible into common stock, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we are not able to obtain financing
when needed, we may be unable to carry out our business plan. As a result, we may have to significantly limit our operations and our
business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed. 

Effect
of Exchange Rate on Cash. 

During
2012, the Company reported a loss of 59 due to changes in the exchange rate compared to a gain of 19,689 in 2011. A loss reflects an
increase in the value of the Canadian dollar as compared to the United States dollar. 

Cash
end of Year. The Company s cash increased by 362,007 to 362,007 at the end of November 30, 2012 compared to an decrease of
 13,005 at the end of November 30, 2011. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of November 30, 2012 we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated
under the Securities Act of 1934. 

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments 

The
Company leases its office space from a related party. See also footnote 7 in the consolidated financial statements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. The critical accounting policies that affect our more significant estimates and assumptions
used in the preparation of our financial statements are reviewed and any required adjustments are recorded on a monthly basis.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
May 2011, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure
Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs . FASB ASU 2011-04 amends and clarifies the measurement and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC
820 resulting in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements, clarification
of how to apply existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements, and changes to certain principles and requirements for measuring
fair value and disclosing information about fair value measurements. The new requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2011. The Company plans to adopt this amended guidance on October 1, 2012 and at this time does not anticipate that it will
have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 

In
June 2011, FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income , which amends the disclosure and presentation requirements
of Comprehensive Income. Specifically, FASB ASU No. 2011-05 requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented
either in 1) a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or 2) two separate but consecutive statements, in which the first
statement presents total net income and its components, and the second statement presents total other comprehensive income and its components.
These new presentation requirements, as currently set forth, are effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2012, with early adoption
permitted. The Company plans to adopt this amended guidance on October 1, 2012 and at this time does not anticipate that it will have
a material impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 

In
September 2011, FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment , which amended goodwill impairment guidance to provide
an option for entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination
that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. After assessing the totality
of events and circumstances, if an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less
than its carrying amount, performance of the two-step impairment test is no longer required. This guidance is effective for annual and
interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. Adoption
of this guidance is not expected to have any impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 

There
were other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific
industries and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

on a one-for-eight basis (which occurred on March 7, 2012) and issued an aggregate of shares of common stock effective
March 7, 2012, representing of the Company s outstanding shares after giving effect to the one-for-eight reverse stock split

and Mr. Bulzak was appointed Chief Technology Officer. Effective February 24, 2012, the name of the Company was changed to Buildablock
Corp. 

On
June 5, 2012, the Company formed a Canadian subsidiary, Buildablock Canada Inc. Buildablock Canada ). Since inception,
Buildablock Canada has had little activity. The Company anticipates that Buildablock Canada will engage in research and development activities. 

Effective
July 1, 2009, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 105-10, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles - Overall ASC 105-1 0 ). ASC 105-10 establishes the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification (the Codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied
by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Rules and interpretive releases
of the SEC under authority offederal securities laws are also sources of authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants. All guidance contained
in the Codification carries an equal level of authority. The Codification superseded all existing n on-SEC accounting and reporting
standards. All other non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification is non-authoritative. The FASB
will not issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Positions or Emerging Issue Task Force Abstracts. Instead, it will issue
Accounting Standards Updates ASUs ). The FASB will not consider ASUs as authoritative in their own right. ASUs will serve
only to update the Codification, provide background information about the guidance and provide the bases for conclusions on the change(s)
in the Codification. References made to FASB guidance throughout this document have been updated for the Codification. 

Going
Concern 

With
the disposition of Valtech, the Company commenced operating in the development stage as it develops its purchased intellectual property.
The Company has no revenues and nominal assets other than cash which was raised during May 2012 as part of a private placement. New management
has had some preliminary discussions regarding further capitalization of the Company. These plans include the raising of capital through
the equity markets to fund future operations and generating adequate revenues for the new business of the Company. Even if the Company
raises sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generates revenues, there can be no assurance that the revenues will
be sufficient to enable it to develop business to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations. These matters
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. However, the accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded
assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company plans to record as revenue the net amount it retains fr m the sale of produ ts, excluding any applicab e taxes, after remitting
the payment to the merchant minus the transaction fees. Revenue will be recorded on a net basis because the Company plans to act as an
agent of the merchant in the transaction. 

The
Company plans that the merchant will be the primary obligor in these transactions,_ will be s bject to inventory risk, and will have
latitude in establishing prices. The Company plans to perform a service by actmg as the agent of the merchant which will be responsible
for fulfillment, and therefore revenue is planned to be recorded on a net basis. 

years. 

When
assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting
gain or loss is recognized in income for the period. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to income as incurred; significant
renewals and betterments are capitalized. Deduction is made for retirements resulting from renewals or betterments. 

reverse split which occurred March 7, 2012. Common stock equivalents were not included in the computation
of diluted earnings per share when the Company reported a loss because to do so would be antidilutive for periods presented. 

In
June 2011, FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which amends the disclosure and presentation requirements
of Comprehensive Income. Specifically, ASU No. 2011-05 requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented
either in 1) a single continuous statement_ of compreh nsive income or 2) two separate but consecutive statements, in which the first
statement presents total net mcome and its components, and the second statement presents total other comprehensive income and its components. 

The
Company adopted this amended guidance, which did not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows
or financial position. 

In
September 2011, FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which amended goodwill impairment guidance to provide an option
for entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination
that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. After assessing the totality
of events and circumstances, if an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less
than its carrying amount, performance of the two-step impairment test is no longer required. This guidance is effective for annual and
interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. 

There

industries and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

square feet of office space owned by a company that is owned by a shareholder of the Company. The
occupancy is on a month-to-month basis, without a lease and without payment ofrent. The Company has occupied the space since February
1, 2008. Accordingly, a rent expense was recorded at the fair value of the applicable rent and with an offset to additional paid-in capital.

Agreement 

In
July 2009, the Company s subsidiary, Valtech Communications, Inc. entered into a written agreement with Groupe Canvar Inc. (a related

will remain with Valtech in connection with the sale of Valtech in April 2012 (see Note 12).

On
June 15, 20 l 0, the Company entered into an Engagement Agreement with DME Securities LLC DME to raise in

terminated on May 31, 2011. 

On
August 18, 20 l 0, the Company executed an equity financing commitment ofup to from Dutchess Capital through its Dutchess

In
connection with the financing, Notre-Dame Capital Inc. would receive a cash fee equal to of the gross proceeds raised under the offering
plus warrants of the raised funds. Each warrant would entitle Notre-Dame Capital Inc. to purchase one share of common stock. The warrants
would be exercisable at the financing price for a period of three years after the closing of the financing. In addition to the proposed
financing, Notre-Dame Capital Inc. and its affiliates would purchase common shares of the Company from the directors of the Company.
No money was raised under this proposed financing and the agreement was cancelled.

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness
of those internal controls. As defined by the SEC, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by our principal executive
officer/principal financial officer, who is also the sole member of our Board of Directors, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2011. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control- Integrated
Framework. Based on our assessment and those criteria, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of November 30, 2011. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only Management s
report in this annual report. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors identified in connection with the evaluation required
by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the fourth quarter ended November 30, 2011 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
