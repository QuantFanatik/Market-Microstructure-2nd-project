 11 

Table of Contents 

 We estimate that reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how will continue to be our principal method of protecting our trade secrets and other proprietary technologies. We generally own (or have permissive licenses for) the intellectual property provided by third-party contractors, even though we hire such contractors to help develop our proprietary software and to provide various fulfillment services. Our proprietary software is not significantly dependent on any third-party software, although our software does utilize open-source code. Notwithstanding the use of this open-source code, we do not believe our usage requires public disclosure of our own source code nor do we believe the use of open-source code will have a material impact on our business. 
 We register some of our product names, slogans and logos in the United States. In addition, we require our employees, contractors and many of those with whom we have business relationships to sign non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements. Neither intellectual property laws, contractual arrangements, nor any of the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property, can ensure that third parties will not exploit our technologies or develop similar technologies. 
 Our proprietary publishing system provides an advanced set of integrated tools for design, service, and modifications to support our mobile web app services. Our mobile web app builder software enables easy and efficient design, end user modification and administration, and includes a variety of other tools accessible by our team members. 
 Human Capital Resources

We recognize that attracting, motivating and retaining talent at all levels is vital to continuing our growth and success. We offer industry-competitive wages and benefits; we are committed to maintaining a workplace environment that promotes employee productivity and satisfaction. 
 
 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 In the following paragraphs, the Company describes some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition (including capital and liquidity), or prospects or the value of or return on an investment in the Company. These risks and uncertainties, however, are not the only ones faced by the Company. Other risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to the Company that it has failed to identify, or that it currently considers immaterial may adversely affect the Company as well. Except where otherwise noted, the risk factors address risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company as well as its subsidiaries. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with Item 7 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to the Financial Statements located in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY GENERALLY 
 Our results of operations could fluctuate due to factors outside of our control. 
 Our operating results have historically fluctuated significantly, and we could continue to experience fluctuations or declining operating results due to factors that may or may not be within our control. Such factors include the following: 
 fluctuating demand for our products and services; 
 changes in economic conditions and the amount of consumers discretionary spending; 
 changes in technologies favored by consumers; 
 customer refunds or cancellations; 
 our ability to continue to bill our customers through existing means; 
 market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our services or products; 
 new product offerings or price competition (or pricing changes) by us or our competitors; 
 with respect to our retail segment, the opening of new stores by competitors in our markets; 
 with respect to our manufacturing segment, changes in import tariffs; 
 the amount and timing of expenditures for the acquisition of new businesses and the expansion of our operations, including the hiring of new employees, capital expenditures, and related costs (including 
 12 

Table of Contents 

 wage cost increases due to historically low unemployment rates and staffing shortages in certain industries); 
 inflationary trends, including recent steep increases in the costs of consumer goods (as measured by CPI), including rising prices for gasoline, may dampen consumer spending at our retail establishments; 
 the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting adverse economic conditions the pandemic has had and may continue to have on our business, financial condition and results of operations; 
 technical difficulties or failures affecting our technical and operating systems in general; and 
 the fixed nature of a significant amount of our operating expenses. 
 Our obligations under our consolidated indebtedness are significant. 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 152.8 million of total consolidated principal indebtedness outstanding consisting of (in 000's): 
 Notes Payable Revolver loans 56,779 Equipment loans 15,486 Term loans 14,290 Other notes payable 15,789 Subtotal notes payable 102,344 Related Party Notes Payable Isaac Capital Group, LLC, 12.5 interest rate, matures May 2025 2,000 Spriggs Investments, LLC, 10 interest rate, matures July 2024 2,000 Spriggs Investments, LLC for Flooring Liquidators, 12 interest rate, matures July 2024 1,000 Isaac Capital Group, LLC revolver, 12 interest rate, matures April 2024 1,000 Isaac Capital Group, LLC for Flooring Liquidators, 12 interest rate, matures January 2028 5,000 Subtotal related party notes payable 11,000 Sellers Notes Payable - Related Party Seller of Flooring Liquidators, 8.24 interest rate, matures January 2028 34,000 Seller of PMW, 8.0 interest rate, matures July 2028 2,500 Seller of Kinetic, 7. interest rate, matures September 2027 3,000 Subtotal sellers notes payable 39,500 Total indebtedness 152,844 
 These financial obligations may have significant negative consequences for us, including: 
 limiting our ability to satisfy our obligations; 
 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate; 
 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; 
 increasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our ability to react to, changing market conditions, changes in our industry and economic downturns; 
 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, acquisitions, general corporate or other obligations; 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 subjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds and make capital expenditures and other investments; 
 restricting our and our wholly-owned subsidiaries ability to make dividend payments and other payments; 
 limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make principal and/or interest payments on our outstanding debt; 
 exposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under certain of our credit facilities; and 
 causing our failure to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our current or future indebtedness, which could cause a default under such indebtedness and which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Because of our floating rate credit facilities, we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes. 
 Our financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, as our floating rate credit facilities are subject to floating interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. Due to our current borrowings under our floating rate credit facilities, or if we were to increase our floating rate credit borrowings, an increase in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As of the year ended September 30, 2023, our amount of floating rate credit borrowings was approximately 56.8 million. 
 If we do not effectively manage our growth and business, our management, administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
 We have expanded our Company over the past few years through the acquisition of different businesses in different industries. We intend to acquire additional businesses (possibly in different sectors) in the future. Significant expansion of our present operations will be required to capitalize on potential growth in market opportunities, will require us to add additional management personnel, and will require us to continue to upgrade our financial and management systems and controls and information technology infrastructure. Any further expansion will also place a significant strain on our existing management, operational, and financial resources. Additionally, due to changing conditions in financial markets, financing may be more difficult or expensive to obtain at rates and terms that are acceptable to the Company. 
 Although we currently have no material long-term need for capital expenditures at our existing operating subsidiaries, we will likely be required to make increased capital expenditures to fund our anticipated growth of operations, infrastructure, and personnel. In the future, we may need to seek additional capital through the issuance of debt (including convertible debt) or equity, depending upon the results of our operations, market conditions, or unforeseen needs or opportunities. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including: 
 the pace of expansion of our operations; 
 our response to competitive pressures; and 
 future acquisitions of complementary products, technologies or businesses. 
 The sale of equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that any financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 
 If we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, fail to remediate a material weaknesses, or fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be adversely affected. 
 The effectiveness of any controls or procedures is subject to certain inherent limitations, and as a result, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will prevent or detect misstatements. Even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting will provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluations of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 14 

Table of Contents 

 If we fail to remediate a material weakness, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, management could be required to expend significant resources and we could fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, and be subject to fines, penalties, investigations or judgements, all of which could negatively affect investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price. 
 Our failure to comply with various applicable federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations could have a material, adverse impact on our business. 
 Various federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations govern our relationships with our employees. These laws and regulations relate to matters, such as employment discrimination, wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, family leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers compensation rules, healthcare laws and regulations (including with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic), and anti-discrimination and anti-harassment laws. Complying with these laws and regulations subjects us to substantial expense and non-compliance could expose us to significant liabilities. We have previously been subject to litigation regarding certain of these matters and may be subject to similar cases in the future. We could suffer losses from these and similar cases, and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. In addition, several states and localities in which we operate (as well as the federal government) have from time-to-time enacted minimum wage increases, changes to eligibility for overtime pay, changes to paid sick leave, changes to mandatory vacation accruals, and changes to other similar requirements. These changes have increased our labor costs and may have a further negative impact on our labor costs in the future. 
 A significant number of our employees are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage. Federal, state and local proposals that increase minimum wage requirements or mandate other employee matters will likely, to the extent implemented, materially increase our labor and other costs. Several states in which we operate have approved minimum wage increases that are above the federal minimum. As more jurisdictions implement minimum wage increases, our labor costs will continue to increase. Our ability to respond to minimum wage increases by increases in our prices depends on the willingness of our customers to pay higher prices and our perceived value relative to our competitors. Our distributors and suppliers could also be affected by higher minimum wages, benefit standards, and compliance costs, which would result in higher costs for goods and services that they supply to us. 
 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately. 
 Our success depends both on our internally developed technology and licensed third-party technology. We rely on a variety of trademarks, service marks, and designs to promote our brand names and identity. We also rely on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures, and trademark, copyright, trade secrecy, unfair competition, and other intellectual property laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our products and services. The commercially reasonable steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property and may not prevent our competitors from gaining access to our intellectual property and proprietary information. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that courts will always uphold our intellectual property rights or enforce the contractual arrangements that we have entered into to obtain and protect our proprietary technology. 
 Third parties, including our partners, contractors, or employees may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, and other proprietary rights. Any such infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, financial condition, liquidity, cash flow, profitability, and results of operations generally. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights, which may result in the dilution of the brand identity of our services and the pricing of our services. 
 We may decide to initiate litigation in order to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial expense and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products or services infringe or misappropriate their intellectual property rights. Any such claim or litigation against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and harm our reputation. In addition, such claims or litigation could force us to do one or more of the following: 
 cease selling or using any of our products and services that incorporate the subject intellectual property, which would adversely affect our revenue; 
 attempt to obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed or misappropriated, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and 
 15 

Table of Contents 

 attempt to redesign or, in the case of trademark claims, rename our products or services to avoid infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may be costly and time-consuming and fail to gain market acceptance. 
 Even if we were to prevail, such claims or litigation could be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend and could result in the diversion of our management s time and attention. These expenses and diversion of managerial resources could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, financial condition, cash flow, profitability, and results of operations generally. 
 We may be subject to intellectual property claims that create uncertainty about ownership or use of technology essential to our business and divert our managerial and other resources. 
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. Third parties may, in the future, claim our current or future services, products, trademarks, technologies, business methods or processes infringe their intellectual property rights, or challenge the validity of our intellectual property rights. We may be subject to patent infringement claims or other intellectual property infringement claims that would be costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain critical technologies or business methods. We may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine the priority of inventions. 
 The defense and prosecution, if necessary, of intellectual property suits, interference proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings can become very costly and may divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. We may not prevail in any of these suits or proceedings. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could require us to pay substantial compensatory and exemplary damages, could restrain us from using critical technologies, business methods or processes, and could result in us losing, or not gaining, valuable intellectual property rights. 
 Furthermore, due to the voluminous amount of discovery frequently conducted in connection with intellectual property litigation, some of our confidential information could be disclosed to competitors during this type of litigation. In addition, public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation could be perceived negatively by investors, and thus have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. 
 Data breaches involving customer or employee data stored by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues. 
 We collect and store confidential information with respect to our customers and employees. A compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses with which we interact could result in information related to our customers or employees being obtained by unauthorized persons. Any such breach of our systems could lead to fraudulent activity resulting in claims and lawsuits against us or other operational problems or interruptions in connection with such breaches. Any breach or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. While we also seek to obtain assurances that others with whom we interact will protect confidential information, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by others may be compromised. If a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, cash flows and liquidity and possibly, subject us to additional legal, regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace. 
 Also, the interpretation and enforcement of data protection laws in the United States and abroad are uncertain and, in certain circumstances, contradictory. These laws may be interpreted and enforced in a manner that is inconsistent with our policies and practices. If we are subject to data security breaches or government-imposed fines, we may have a loss in sales or be forced to pay damages or other amounts, which could adversely affect profitability, or be subject to substantial costs related to compliance. 
 Tax matters, including the changes in corporate tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives. 
 We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other state and local taxing authorities with respect to our tax filings. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. 
 We also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, or other changes in the application or interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations. 
 We are involved in an ongoing SEC investigation, which could divert management s focus, result in substantial investigation expenses and have an adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 On August 2, 2021, the SEC filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada naming the Company and two of its executive officers - Jon Isaac, the Company s current President and Chief Executive Officer, and Virland Johnson, the Company s former Chief Financial Officer, as defendants (collectively, the Company Defendants as well as certain other related third parties (the SEC Complaint ). The SEC Complaint alleges various financial, disclosure, and reporting violations related to income and earnings per share data, purported undisclosed stock promotion and trading, purported inaccurate disclosure regarding beneficial ownership of common stock, and undisclosed executive compensation from 2016 through 2018. The violations are brought under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5; Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-14, 13a-13, 13b2-1, 13b2-2; Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-3; and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions against the Company Defendants, permanent officer-and-director bars, disgorgement of profits, and civil penalties. The foregoing is only a general summary of the SEC Complaint, which may be accessed on the SEC s website at https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2021/lr25155.htm. 
 
 On October 1, 2021, the Company Defendants and third-party defendants moved to dismiss the SEC complaint. On September 7, 2022, the court denied the Company Defendants motion to dismiss, but granted one of the third-party defendant s motions to dismiss, granting the SEC leave to file an amended complaint. On September 21, 2022, the SEC filed an amended complaint to which the Company Defendants filed an answer on October 11, 2022, denying liability. The court subsequently entered a discovery scheduling order and the parties exchanged initial disclosures. The parties participated in a mediation in June 2023. The mediation was not successful and the case is currently in the midst of discovery. Discovery deadlines have been extended because counsel for JanOne and Virland Johnson moved to withdraw on August 18, 2023, which motion the court granted on October 2, 2023. JanOne and Virland Johnson have until January 4, 2024, to obtain new counsel, after which time the Company anticipates depositions will commence. 
 
 The SEC complaint has been costly to defend and has and may continue to divert our management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Further, we may not prevail in the SEC complaint. An adverse determination of the SEC complaint against any of the Company Defendants including the Company and certain of our executive officers could require us to pay substantial fines and damages, could restrain certain executive officers from providing director and officer services to the Company, and could negatively affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows . 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY 
 We may not be able to identify, acquire or establish control of, or effectively integrate previously acquired businesses, which could materially adversely affect our growth. 
 As part of our business strategy, we intend to pursue a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of new businesses, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures. Although we regularly evaluate such opportunities, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities successfully, obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms or at all to fund such strategic transactions, complete any such acquisitions and integrate the acquired businesses with our existing businesses, or manage profitable acquired businesses or strategic investments. 
 The acquisition of a company or business is accompanied by a number of risks, including: 
 failure of due diligence during the acquisition process; 
 adverse short-term effects on reported operating results; 
 the potential loss of key partners or key personnel in connection with, or as the result of, a transaction; 
 the impairment of relationships with clients of the acquired business, or our own customers, partners or employees, as a result of any integration of operations or the expansion of our offerings; 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 the recording of goodwill and intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges; 
 the diversion of management s time and resources; 
 the risk of entering into markets or producing products where we have limited or no experience, including the integration or removal of the acquired or disposed products with or from our existing products; and 
 the inability properly to implement or remediate internal controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at businesses that prior to our acquisition were not subject to federal securities laws and may have lacked appropriate controls, procedures and policies. 
 The acquisition of new businesses is costly and such acquisitions may not enhance our financial condition. 
 Our growth strategy is to acquire companies and identify and acquire assets and technologies from companies in various industries that have a demonstrated history of strong earnings potential. The process to undertake a potential acquisition is time-consuming and costly. We expend significant resources to undertake business, financial, and legal due diligence on our potential acquisition target and there is no guarantee that we would acquire a target company after we complete due diligence. 
 Our acquisitions could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or convertible debt securities, significant write-downs of goodwill, and other intangible assets and exposure to undisclosed or potential liabilities of the acquired companies. To the extent that the goodwill arising from the acquisitions carried on the financial statements does not pass the goodwill impairment test, excess goodwill will be charged to, and reduce, future earnings. 
 Because we do not intend to use our own employees or members of management to run the daily operations at our acquired companies, business operations might be interrupted if employees at the acquired businesses were to resign, or be terminated. 
 As part of our acquisition strategy, we do not use our own employees or members of our management team to operate the acquired companies. Key members of management at these acquired companies have been in place for several years and have established relationships with their customers. Competition for executive-level personnel is strong and we can make no assurance that we will be able to retain these key members of management for any period of time. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of these key members of management and provided incentives to stay with the business after it has been acquired, if such key persons were to resign, we might face impairment of relationships with remaining employees or customers, which might cause long-term customers to terminate their relationships with the acquired companies, which may, in turn, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR RETAIL-ENTERTAINMENT AND RETAIL-FLOORING SEGMENTS 
 Economic conditions in the U.S. could adversely affect demand for the products we sell. 
 Sales of products are driven, in part, by discretionary spending by consumers. Consumers are typically more likely to make discretionary purchases, including purchasing movies, games, music, flooring, and other discretionary products when there are favorable economic conditions. Consumer spending may be affected by many economic factors outside of our control, such as a decline in consumer confidence in current and future economic conditions, levels of employment, consumer debt levels, and inflation. These and other economic factors could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Technological advances in the delivery and types of video, video games and PC entertainment software, as well as changes in consumer behavior related to these new technologies, could lower sales. 
 While it is currently possible to download video, video game content, and music to the current generation of video and gaming systems, downloading is somewhat constrained by bandwidth capacity and video game and movie file sizes. However, broadband speeds are increasing and downloading technology is becoming more prevalent and continues to evolve rapidly. The current game consoles from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo have facilitated download technology. If these consoles and other advances in technology continue to expand our customers ability to access and download the current format of video, music and games and incremental content from their games and videos through these and other 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 sources, our customers may no longer choose to purchase videos, DVDs, video games and music in our stores or they may reduce their purchases in favor of other forms of video, digital, and game delivery. As a result, our sales and earnings could decline. 
 Vintage Stock may not compete effectively as browser, mobile and social video viewing and gaming becomes more popular. 
 Listening to music, gaming, and viewing video and digital content continues to evolve rapidly. The popularity of browser, mobile and social viewing and gaming have increased greatly, and this popularity is expected to continue to grow. Browser, mobile and social video viewing, listening to music and gaming are accessed through hardware other than the game consoles and traditional hand-held video and game devices we currently sell. If there is continued growth in popularity of browser, mobile and social viewing and gaming, our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be impacted negatively. 
 Sales of video games containing graphic violence may decrease as a result of actual violent events or other reasons, and Vintage Stock s, and our, financial results may be adversely affected as a result. 
 Many popular video games contain material with graphic violence. These games receive an M or T rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board. As actual violent events occur and are publicized, or for other reasons, public acceptance of graphic violence in video games may decline. Consumer advocacy groups may increase their efforts to oppose sales of graphically-violent video games and may seek legislation prohibiting their sales. As a result, our sales of those games may decrease, which could negatively impact our results of operations. 
 As a seller of certain consumer products, we are subject to various federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and statutes related to product safety and consumer protection. 
 While we take steps to comply with these laws, there can be no assurance that they will be in compliance, and failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties that could have a negative impact on their respective businesses, financial condition, and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Each of them may also be subject to involuntary or voluntary product recalls or product liability lawsuits. Direct costs or reputational damage associated with product recalls or product liability lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, could have a negative impact on future revenues and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. 
 International events could delay or prevent the delivery of products to our suppliers. 
 Some of our suppliers rely on foreign sources to manufacture a portion of the products or raw materials that we purchase from them. As a result, any event causing a disruption of imports, including natural disasters, supply chain disruptions or the imposition of import restrictions or trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available, which could lower their sales and profitability and, indirectly, ours. 
 If we are unable to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms, our revenue growth may decline. 
 All of our retail stores are located in leased premises. If the cost of leasing existing stores increases, we can't be certain that we will be able to maintain its existing store locations as leases expire. In addition, we may not be able to enter into new leases on favorable terms or at all, or may not be able to locate suitable alternative sites or additional sites for new store expansion in a timely manner. Its revenues and earnings may decline if it fails to maintain existing store locations, enter into new leases, locate alternative sites, or find additional sites for new store expansion. 
 An adverse trend in sales during the winter and holiday selling season could impact our financial results. 
 Our retail business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with a major portion of Vintage Stock s sales realized around various holidays and other days, including Black Friday, President s Day, tax refund season, Memorial Day, July 4 th , and Labor Day. Any adverse trend in sales during these times could negatively impact their results of operations and, indirectly, ours. 
 Results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. 
 Results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon several factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to: 
 the timing and allocations of new product releases; 
 the timing of new store openings or closings; 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 shifts in the timing or content or certain promotions or service offerings; 
 the effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we are operating; 
 acquisition costs and the integration of companies we acquire or invest in; and 
 the costs associated with the exit of unprofitable markets or stores. 
 These and other factors could affect its business, financial condition and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, and this makes the prediction of our financial results on a quarterly basis difficult. Also, it is possible that our quarterly financial results may be below the expectations of public market analysts. 
 Failure to manage our new store openings effectively could lower our sales and profitability. 
 Our growth strategy depends in part upon opening new stores and operating them profitably. Their ability to open new stores and operate them profitability depends upon a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include the ability to: 
 identify new store locations, negotiate suitable leases and build out the stores in a timely and cost-efficient manner; 
 hire and train skilled associates; 
 integrate new stores into existing operations; and 
 increase sales at new store locations. 
 If we fail to manage new store openings in a timely and cost-efficient manner, our growth or profits may decrease. 
 If our management information systems fail to perform or are inadequate, our ability to manage our business could be disrupted. 
 We rely on computerized inventory and management systems to coordinate and manage the activities in our stores and distribution centers. We use inventory replenishment systems to track sales and inventory. Our ability to rapidly process incoming shipments of new products and deliver them to all of our stores enables us to meet peak demand and replenish our stores to keep them in stock at optimal levels and to move inventory efficiently. If our inventory or management information systems fail to perform these functions adequately, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if operations in any of our distribution centers were to shut down or be disrupted for a prolonged period of time or if these centers were unable to accommodate the continued store growth in a particular region, our business would suffer. 
 We may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges which could negatively impact our future results of operations and financial condition. 
 We have previously recorded significant goodwill. Because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. We also have long-lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets which we review both on an annual basis as well as when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If a determination is made that a significant impairment in value of goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets has occurred, such determination could require us to impair a substantial portion of our assets. Asset impairments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Specific to our Retail-Flooring Segment 
 The floor covering industry may face supply chain restrictions based upon legislation enacted limiting imports from certain global regions. 
 The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (the UFLPA ), effective June 21, 2022, provides a rebuttable presumption that goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China are prohibited from U.S. importation. Imports of polyvinyl chloride PVC ), a major component in the production of luxury vinyl flooring and sourced from the Xinjiang region, may be examined pursuant to the UFLPA under 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 the presumption it was produced using forced labor. A disruption in the import of PVC could have an impact on our supply chain and inventory levels, thereby negatively impacting our operating results. 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR FLOORING MANUFACTURING SEGMENT 
 The floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, such as consumer confidence and income, corporate and government spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and demand for housing. Significant or prolonged declines in the U.S. or global economies could have a material adverse effect on the Company s flooring manufacturing business. 
 Downturns in the U.S. and global economies, along with the residential and commercial markets in such economies, negatively impact the floor covering industry and our flooring manufacturing business. Although difficult economic conditions have improved in the U.S., there may be additional downturns in the future that could cause the industry to deteriorate. A significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial remodeling or new construction activity could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Marquis may be unable to predict customer preferences or demand accurately, or to respond to technological developments. 
 Marquis operates in a market sector where demand is strongly influenced by rapidly changing customer preferences as to product design and technical features. Failure to respond quickly and effectively to changing customer demand or technological developments could materially adversely affect Marquis business, financial condition and results of operations and, indirectly, ours. 
 Marquis faces intense competition in the flooring industry that could decrease demand for its products or force it to lower its prices, which could have a material adverse effect on its business operations and prospects, financial condition, liquidity, cash flow, profitability, and results of operations generally. 
 The floor covering industry is highly competitive. Marquis faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors, many of whom have greater financial and operational resources than it. Maintaining its competitive position may require substantial investments in its product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network, and sales and marketing activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for our products or force it to lower its prices. Moreover, a strong U.S. dollar, combined with lower fuel costs, may contribute to more attractive pricing for imports that compete with Marquis products, which may put pressure on its pricing. The occurrence of one or more of these factors could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations and, indirectly, ours. 
 In periods of rising costs, Marquis may be unable to pass raw materials, energy and fuel-related cost increases on to its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on its business operations and prospects, financial condition, liquidity, cash flow, profitability, and results of operations. 
 The prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs vary significantly with market conditions. Although Marquis generally attempts to pass on increases in raw material, energy, and fuel-related costs to its customers, its ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures, and market conditions for its products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered. During such periods of time, the occurrence of such events may materially adversely affect Marquis business, financial condition, and results of operations and, indirectly, ours. 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR STEEL MANUFACTURING SEGMENT 
 The demand for steel manufacturing segment's products may decrease if manufacturing in North America declines or if automakers, who manufacture their products in the U.S., do not introduce new models or their sales decline. 
 The products manufactured by our steel manufacturing segment typically follow the North American (primarily, the U.S.) manufacturing cycle, with a large emphasis on automotive manufacturing. If North American (primarily, the U.S.) manufacturing is transferred offshore, then the need for our products to make tools and dies will decrease, which will have a negative impact on the steel manufacturing segment s business, financial condition (including, without limitation, its liquidity), results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we rely heavily on the sale of our products to automakers who purchase our products when they retool production lines in connection with the introduction of new models. If those automakers do not introduce a new model in any given year, our sales may decrease which will have a negative impact on 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 our business, financial condition (including, without limitation, our liquidity), results of operations, and cash flows and, indirectly, ours. 
 Limited availability, or volatility in prices of raw materials and energy may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins. 
 Our steel manufacturing segment and other steel producers have periodically faced problems obtaining sufficient raw materials in a timely manner, and sometimes at all, due to a limited number of suppliers, delays, defaults, severe weather conditions, force majeure events (including public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain issues and disruptions), shortages, or transportation problems (such as shortages of barges, vessels, rail cars or trucks, or disruption of rail lines, waterways, or natural gas transmission lines), resulting in production curtailments. As a result, we may be exposed to risks concerning pricing and availability of raw materials from third parties, as well as supply and logistics constraints moving its own raw materials to its plants. In addition, if the already limited number of suppliers consolidate, it would limit our steel manufacturing segment s negotiating power for raw material purchases. 
 We have in the past, and may in the future, purchase raw materials from sources even when they are at above market prices. Additionally, any future decreases in iron ore, scrap, natural gas and oil prices may place downward pressure on steel prices. If steel prices decline, our steel manufacturing segment s profit margins could temporarily be reduced, as higher cost inventory is turned over. 
 Shortages of qualified and trainable labor, increased labor costs, or our steel manufacturing segment s failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results. 
 Our steel manufacturing segment depends on skilled or trainable drug-free labor for the manufacture of its products. Its continued success depends on the active participation of its key employees. Our steel manufacturing segment, like other companies that rely on a trained blue-collar workforce, receives pressure from other manufacturers regarding the labor pool. Our steel manufacturing segment, aside from competing with other manufacturers, also competes with non-industrial blue-collar professions for labor. Should a significant employer move into our geographical area, such employer could draw from the current labor pool and require a substantial increase in training expense. 
 Our operational footprint, unplanned equipment outages, and other unforeseen disruptions may adversely impact our results of operations. 
 Our steel manufacturing segment has adjusted its business model over time to utilize its equipment and manufacturing facility fully. Production depends on running at a moderate rate of capacity. Outages due to power outages, weather, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), or machine outages affect its capability to produce at the level necessary to meet customer demand or at all. 
 It is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances, such as union and other foreign tariffs, free trade agreements, trade regulations, laws, and policies. Our steel manufacturing segment is also exposed to similar risks involving major customers and suppliers, such as force majeure events of raw materials suppliers that have occurred and may occur in the future. Availability of raw materials and delivery of products to customers could be affected by logistical disruptions, such as shortages of barges, ocean vessels, rail cars or trucks, or unavailability of rail lines or of the locks on the Great Lakes or other bodies of water. To the extent that lost production could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage, our sales and our unit production costs could be adversely affected. 
 Our production and distribution workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations. 
 Precision Marshall s manufacturing employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement through the United Steelworkers and its warehouse and distribution workforce employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement through the International Association of Aeronautical and Machinists. These agreements were successfully renegotiated during 2021 without a work stoppage, and were extended through September 2026 and April 2026, respectively. Future negotiations prior to the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements may result in labor unrest for which a strike or work stoppage is possible. Strikes and/or work stoppages could negatively affect Precision Marshall s operational and financial results and may increase operating expenses and, indirectly, ours.

Table of Contents 

 We rely on third parties for transportation services, and increases in costs or the availability of transportation may adversely affect our business and operations 
 Our steel manufacturing segment s business depends on the transportation of a large number of products. It relies primarily on third parties for transportation of its products, as well as delivery of its raw materials. Any increase in the cost of the transportation of our raw materials or products, as a result of increases in fuel or labor costs, higher demand for logistics services, consolidation in the transportation industry, or otherwise, may adversely affect our steel manufacturing segment s results of operations, as it may not be able to pass such cost increases on to its customers. 
 If any of these transportation service providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, it might be unable to manufacture and deliver its products in response to customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, it might be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost or at any cost, as there are a limited number of suppliers worldwide for our steel manufacturing segment s raw materials. 
 In addition, such failure of a third-party transportation provider could harm our steel manufacturing segment's reputation, negatively affect its customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of operations and, indirectly, ours. 
 We face risks relating to changes in U.S. and foreign tariffs, trade agreements, laws, and policies 
 Our steel manufacturing segment s business depends on manufacturing products in North America. If tariffs were to rise disproportionally on raw materials compared to finished goods, we would be at risk for manufacturers to cease purchasing the products from it and instead purchasing products from third parties who are not subject to such tariffs, trade agreements, laws, and/or policies. 
 The steel industry is highly cyclical, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Steel consumption is highly cyclical and generally follows economic and industrial conditions both worldwide and in regional markets. This volatility makes it difficult to balance the procurement of raw materials and energy with global steel prices, our steel production and customer product demand. Our steel manufacturing segment has implemented strategic initiatives to produce more variable results during periods of economic and market downturns; but, this may not be enough to mitigate the effect that the volatility inherent in the steel industry has on our results of operations. 
 Additionally, our steel manufacturing segment s business is reliant on certain other industries that are cyclical in nature. Precision Marshall sells to distributors, who, in turn, sell to the automotive, appliance, defense, and construction-related industries. Some of these industries exhibit a great deal of sensitivity to general economic conditions and may also face meaningful fluctuations in demand based on a number of factors outside of our control, including regulatory factors, economic conditions, and raw material and energy costs. As a result, downturns, or volatility in any of the markets served could adversely affect our steel manufacturing segment s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and, indirectly, ours. 
 Compliance with existing and new environmental regulations, environmental permitting and approval requirements may result in delays or other adverse impacts on planned projects, our results of operations and cash flows. 
 Steel producers in the U.S., along with their customers and suppliers, are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations concern the generation, storage, transportation, disposal, emission or discharge of pollutants, contaminants and hazardous substances into the environment, the reporting of such matters, and the general protection of public health and safety, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. Steel producers in the European Union ("EU") are subject to similar laws. These laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent. The ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision. Additionally, compliance with certain state and local requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs. Compliance with current or future regulations could entail additional costs for additional systems and could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with the requirements may result in administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, revocation of permits to conduct business or construct certain facilities, substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances. 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 In addition, our steel manufacturing segment outsources all disposal of waste material, non-compliance by third party providers could result in additional costs to defend environmental claims or additional costs to replace the outsourced entities. 
 There can be no assurance that future approvals, licenses and permits will be granted or that our steel manufacturing segment will be able to maintain and renew the approvals, licenses, and permits it currently holds. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, compliance with the environmental permitting and approval requirements may be costly and time consuming and could result in delays or other adverse impacts on planned projects, our results of operations and cash flows. 
 Increasing pressure to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from steelmaking operations to comply with U.S. and EU regulations as well as societal expectations could increase costs to manufacture future raw materials or reduce the amount of materials being manufactured. 
 Precision Marshall relies on raw material sources in the EU and U.S. Tightening of those requirements in the EU and/or sources in the U.S. could deter steel produces from producing the raw material for our products or result in significant price increases of our raw material. 
 GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 We depend on key persons and the loss of any key person could adversely affect our operations. 
 The future success of our business is dependent on our senior leadership team members. Our senior leadership team members have extensive sales and marketing, engineering, product development, manufacturing and finance backgrounds in the various industries our subsidiaries operate. If one or more of our key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to easily replace them, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit and train new personnel. The loss of our key personnel could severely disrupt our business and its financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to attract or retain the key personnel needed to achieve our business objectives. 
 Adverse developments in our ongoing legal proceedings or future legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or stock price. 
 We have been, and may continue to be subject to investigations, arbitration proceedings, audits, regulatory inquiries and similar actions, including matters related to intellectual property, employment, securities laws, disclosures, tax, accounting, class action and product liability, as well as regulatory and other claims related to our business and our industry, which we refer to collectively as legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, or whether ongoing investigations will be resolved favorably or ultimately result in charges or material damages, fines or other penalties, enforcement actions, bars against serving as an officer or director, or regulation by the SEC, or civil or criminal proceedings against us or members of our senior management. 
 Legal proceedings in general, and securities and class action litigation and regulatory investigations in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Our insurance, to the extent maintained, may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us and we are unable to predict how long the legal proceedings to which we are currently subject will continue. An unfavorable outcome of any legal proceeding may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, prospects, or our stock price. Any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our stakeholders. Furthermore, publicity surrounding ongoing legal proceedings, even if resolved favorably for us, could result in additional legal proceedings against us, as well as damage our image. 
 Due to our concentrated stock ownership, public stockholders may have no effective voice in our management and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected. 
 As of December 11, 2023, Isaac Capital Group LLC ICG ), together with Jon Isaac, our President and CEO and the President and sole member of ICG, control approximately 48.8 of the outstanding voting power of our company (assuming the exercise of all outstanding and exercisable warrants held by them). Jon Isaac has the sole power to vote the shares of our common stock owned by ICG. As a result, Jon Isaac, both individually and through ICG, is able to exercise significant influence over all matters that require us to obtain stockholder approval, including the election of directors to our Board and approval of significant corporate transactions that we may consider, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets. Moreover, such a concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us. This significant concentration of share ownership may also adversely affect the trading price 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with concentrated stock ownership. 
 Because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your shares of common stock for a price greater than your purchase price for your shares. 
 We may retain future earnings, if any, for future operation, expansion, and debt repayment and, with the exception of dividends payable on shares of our Series E Preferred Stock, we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. Therefore, any return on your investment would likely come only from an increase in the market value of our common stock. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price. 
 Certain provisions of Nevada law, in our organizational documents and in contracts to which we are party may prevent or delay a change of control of our company. 
 We are subject to the Nevada anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prevent Nevada corporations from engaging in a merger, consolidation, sales of its stock or assets, and certain other transactions with any stockholder, including all affiliates and associates of the stockholder, who owns 10 or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock, for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired 10 or more of the corporation s voting stock, except in certain situations. In addition, our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws include a number of provisions that may deter or impede hostile takeovers or changes of control or management. These provisions include the following: 
 the authority of our Board of Directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, and privileges of these shares, without stockholder approval; 
 stockholders must comply with advance notice requirements to transact any business at the annual meeting; 
 all stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called meeting of stockholders and not by written consent, unless such action or proposal is first approved by our Board of Directors; 
 special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or the President of our Company; 
 a director may be removed from office only for cause by the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power entitled to vote at an election of directors; 
 our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to alter, amend or repeal our bylaws; 
 newly-created directorships and vacancies on our Board of Directors may only be filled by a majority of remaining directors, and not by our stockholders; and 
 cumulative voting is not allowed in the election of our directors. 
 These provisions of Nevada law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change of control of our company and may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.

 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We evaluate the performance of our operations based on financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and other non-cash or nonrecurring charges. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of the business, including the business ability to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures, and to service its debt. Additionally, this measure is used by management to evaluate operating results and perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also a measure that is customarily used by financial analysts to evaluate a 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 company s financial performance, subject to certain adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash flows from operations, as defined by GAAP, and should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss and is indicative neither of our results of operations, nor of cash flows available to fund all of our cash needs. It is, however, a measurement that the Company believes is useful to investors in analyzing its operating performance. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities, and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. As companies often define non-GAAP financial measures differently, Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by the Company, should not be compared to any similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of net income, the closest GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA is provided below.

The increase is primarily due to the acquisitions of Kinetic during June 2022 and PMW during July 2023, partially offset by a decrease of 6.4 million from Precision Marshall. The decrease by Precision Marshall was due to reduced customer demand as a result of general economic conditions. 
 Corporate and Other revenue decreased by approximately 6.8 million, or 73.2 , to approximately 2.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to approximately 9.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the shutdown and deconsolidation of SW Financial in May 2023. 
 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue increased by approximately 50.5 million, or 26.7 for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenues was 67.5 for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 65.9 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to inflationary cost increases, as well as the acquisition of PMW, which historically has generated lower margins, partially offset by the acquisition of Flooring Liquidators, which historically has generated higher margins. 
 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative expense increased by approximately 32.1 million or 58.9 , for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the acquisitions of Kinetic in June 2022, Flooring Liquidators in January 2023, and PMW in July 2023, which collectively contributed 33.8 million of general and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for Flooring Liquidators was approximately 27.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, and was primarily comprised of compensation, rent, and amortization expense. 
 
 Selling and Marketing Expense 
 Selling and marketing expense increased by approximately 1.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to convention and trade show activity in our Flooring Manufacturing segment and Retail-Flooring segment due to the acquisition of Flooring Liquidators.

 Interest Expense, net 
 Interest expense, net increased by approximately 8.5 million or 202.7 , for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily due to increased debt balances related to the acquisitions of Flooring Liquidators, Kinetic, and PMW, and to fund operations, and also higher interest rates during the period. 
 
 Gain on Bankruptcy Settlement 
 During the year ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a gain of approximately 11.4 million due to the discharge of certain obligations relating to the ApplianceSmart bankruptcy. No similar gains or losses were recognized during the year ended September 30, 2023.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and funds available under our asset-based revolver lines of credit will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, pay our scheduled loan payments, allow for the repurchase of shares under our share buyback program, and pay dividends on our shares of Series E Preferred Stock as declared by the Board of Directors, for at least the next 12 months. 
 We have the following five asset-based revolver lines of credit: (i) Texas Capital Bank Revolver Loan TCB Revolver utilized by Vintage Stock, (ii) Bank of America Revolver Loan BofA Revolver utilized by Marquis, (iii) two Fifth Third Bank Revolver Loans Fifth Third Revolvers ), one utilized by Precision Marshall and the other by PMW, and (iv) Eclipse Business Capital Revolver Loan Eclipse Revolver utilized by Flooring Liquidators.

 As of September 30, 2023, we had total cash availability of approximately 37.1 million, comprised of approximately 4.3 million in cash, as well as approximately 32.8 million of available borrowing under our revolving credit facilities. As we continue to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions to expand and grow our business, we regularly monitor capital market conditions and may raise additional funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. The amount, nature and timing of any borrowings or sales of debt or equity securities will depend on our

 operating performance and other circumstances; our then-current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 The Company s cash at September 30, 2023 was approximately 4.3 million compared to approximately 4.6 million at September 30, 2022, a decrease of approximately 300,000. Net cash provided by operations was approximately 26.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to net cash provided by operations of approximately 6.4 million for the same period in 2022. The increase is primarily due to a reduction in purchases of inventory, a reduction in income taxes receivable, as well as an increase in accrued liabilities during the period. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company has reclassified approximately 8.2 million from operating activities to financing activities in its consolidated statement of cash flows for the period, which relates to proceeds received from a failed sales and leaseback transaction as part of the Kinetic acquisition. The reclassification decreased fiscal year 2022 cash generated from operating activities from 14.6 million as previously reported to 6.4 million as adjusted. 
 Our primary sources of cash inflows are from customer receipts from sales on account, factored accounts receivable proceeds, and net remittances from directory services customers processed in the form of ACH billings. Our most significant cash outflows include payments for raw materials and general operating expenses, including payroll costs and general and administrative expenses that typically occur within close proximity of expense recognition. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Our cash flows used in investing activities of approximately 64.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment and our acquisitions of Flooring Liquidators, PMW, and Cal Coast Carpets. Our cash flows used in investing activities of approximately 40.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment and our acquisitions of Kinetic and Better Backers. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Our cash flows provided by financing activities of approximately 37.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of approximately 15.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of notes payable, net proceeds from revolver loans of approximately 13.7 million, proceeds from failed sales and leaseback transactions of 12.7 million, and proceeds from the issuance of related party debt of 7.0 million, partially offset by payments on notes payable and finance leases of approximately 10.5 million, and purchases of treasury stock of approximately 1.0 million. Proceeds from borrowings under revolver loans, the issuance of notes payable and related party notes payable was primarily associated with the acquisitions of Flooring Liquidators and PMW. 
 Our cash flows provided by financing activities of approximately 33.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily consisted in net proceeds from revolver loans of approximately 21.6 million, approximately 17.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of notes payable, and proceeds from a failed sales and leaseback transaction of approximately 8.2 million, partially offset by payments on notes payable and finance leases of approximately 10.6 million, and purchases of treasury stock of approximately 2.7 million. Proceeds from borrowings under revolver loans and the issuance of notes payable was primarily associated with the acquisition of Kinetic. 
 Currently, the Company is not issuing common shares for liquidity purposes. We prefer to use asset-based lending arrangements and mezzanine financing together with Company provided capital to finance acquisitions and have done so historically. Occasionally, as our Company history has demonstrated, we will issue stock and derivative instruments linked to stock for services and/or debt settlement. 
 Working Capital 
 We had working capital of approximately 85.0 million as of September 30, 2023 as compared to approximately 78.4 million as of September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily due to the net assets received from the acquisitions of Flooring Liquidators and PMW, increases in accounts receivable and inventories, partially offset by increases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt and the current portion of operating lease obligations.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 
 Live Ventures Incorporated 
 Las Vegas, Nevada 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Live Ventures Incorporated (the "Company") as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of (loss) income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP"). 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired Precision Metal Works, Inc. ("PMW"), a Kentucky-based Metal Stamping and Value-Added Manufacturing Company. PMW was acquired for a net purchase price of approximately 27 million. As part of its purchase price allocation, the Company determined 3.6 million should be allocated to customer relationship and trade name intangible assets and approximately 13.6 million to property, plant, and equipment. 
 In addition, the Company acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Flooring Liquidators, Inc., Elite Builder Services, Inc., 7 Day Stone, Inc., Floorable, LLC, K2L Leasing, LLC, and SJ K Equipment, Inc. (collectively, "Flooring Liquidators"). Flooring Liquidators is comprised of leading retailers and installers of floors, carpets, and countertops to consumers, builders, and contractors in California and Nevada. Flooring Liquidators was acquired for a net purchase price of approximately 78.7 million. As part of its purchase price allocation, the Company determined approximately 21 million should be allocated to customer relationship and trade name intangible assets. 
 We identified the Company's valuation of the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management used in the estimate of the preliminary acquisition date 
 F-1 

Table of Contents 

 fair value, including forecasts of future revenues and expenses and the selection of the discount rates. Auditing management's forecasts of future revenues and expenses as well as the selection of the discount rates involved a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort, including the use of our valuation specialists, as changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the preliminary acquisition date fair value of the acquired intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment. 
 Our audit procedures related to the Company's estimate of the preliminary acquisition date fair value of the intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment included the following, among others: 
 We read the purchase agreements to understand and evaluate the terms of the transaction to determine that the acquisition met the requirements of a business combination. 
 We evaluated the analysis of the initial allocation of the purchase price accounting as well as the determination of the balance sheet classification of each component of the transaction. 
 We obtained the Company's third-party expert valuation report to gain an understanding of the processes and key assumptions for estimating the fair value of intangible assets and other acquired assets and liabilities. 
 We utilized our valuation specialists to evaluate the adequacy and appropriateness of the methodologies and assumptions, including the weighted-average cost of capital and the discount rate, used by the Company's third-party valuation expert in developing the estimated fair value of the intangible assets, property, plant, and equipment, and other assets and liabilities. 
 We assessed the reasonableness of management's cash flow forecasts based on historical results, revenue growth assumptions and expected inflation. 
 We performed independent calculations to test the reasonableness and mathematical accuracy of the fair values concluded on by the Company. 
 We evaluated the qualifications of the Company's third-party valuation expert based on credentials, reputation and experience. 
 We assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. 
 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2021.

 Flooring and Steel Manufacturing Segments 
 The Flooring Manufacturing Segment derives revenue primarily from the sale of carpet and hard surface flooring products, including shipping and handling amounts. The Steel Manufacturing Segments derives revenue primarily from the sale of steel plates, ground flat stock and drill rods, and tooling, including shipping and handling amounts. Revenue for these segments generally contain a single performance obligation and is recognized at the point title passes to the customer. At the time revenue is recognized, the Company records a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based primarily on historical experience and any known trends or conditions that exist at the time revenue is recognized. Revenues are recorded net of taxes collected from customers. All direct costs are either paid and or accrued for in the period in which the sale is recorded. 
 Spare Parts 
 For spare parts sales, the Company transfers control and recognizes a sale when it ships the product to the customer or when the customer receives product based upon agreed shipping terms. Each unit sold is considered an independent, unbundled performance obligation. The Company has no additional performance obligations other than spare parts sales that are material in the context of the contract. The amount of consideration received and revenue recognized varies due to sales incentives and returns offered to customers. When customers retain the right to return eligible products, the Company reduces revenue for the estimate of the expected returns, which is primarily based on an analysis of historical experience.

 ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure control and Procedures . We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision, and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, as of September 30, 2023, we concluded that the Company's disclosure, controls, and procedures were effective. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 The Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, do not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures or the Company s internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, regardless of how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. These inherent limitations include the following: judgements in decision-making can be faulty, and control and process breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes, controls can be circumvented by individuals, acting alone or in collusion with each other, or by management override. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 
 
 Our management assessed the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO of 2013 regarding Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment using those criteria, as of September 30, 2023, our management (with the participation of the Company s CEO and CFO) under the oversight of the Board of Directors, concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective at the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Tony Isaac does not receive any compensation from the Company other than compensation equivalent to that paid to the independent members of the Board. 
 Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 
 To the best of our knowledge, there have been no events under any bankruptcy act, no criminal proceedings and no judgments, injunctions, orders, or decrees material to the evaluation of the ability and integrity of any director during the past ten years other than the following: (i) filing by ApplianceSmart, Inc., of a voluntary petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code, at which time Jon Isaac was serving as its President, Chief Executive Officer, and director, and Virland Johnson, our former Chief Financial Officer, was serving as a director of ApplianceSmart, Inc., from which it emerged on February, 28, 2022; and, (ii) a civil complaint filed by the SEC naming the Company, Jon Isaac, Tony Isaac, and the Company s then-CFO, Virland Johnson, among other parties, as defendants (see below for more information). 
 SEC Investigation 
 On August 2, 2021, the SEC filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada naming the Company and two of its executive officers - Jon Isaac, the Company s current President and Chief Executive Officer, and Virland Johnson, the Company s former Chief Financial Officer, as defendants (collectively, the Company Defendants as well as certain other related third parties (the SEC Complaint ). The SEC Complaint alleges various financial, disclosure, and reporting violations related to income and earnings per share data, purported undisclosed stock promotion and trading, purported inaccurate disclosure regarding beneficial ownership of common stock, and undisclosed executive compensation from 2016 through 2018. The violations are brought under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5; Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-14, 13a-13, 13b2-1, 13b2-2; Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-3; and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions against the Company Defendants, permanent officer-and-director bars, disgorgement of profits, and civil penalties. The foregoing is only a general summary of the SEC Complaint, which may be accessed on the SEC s website at https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2021/lr25155.htm. 
 
 On October 1, 2021, the Company Defendants and third-party defendants moved to dismiss the SEC complaint. On September 7, 2022, the court denied the Company Defendants motion to dismiss, but granted one of the third-party defendant s motions to dismiss, granting the SEC leave to file an amended complaint. On September 21, 2022, the SEC filed an amended complaint to which the Company Defendants filed an answer on October 11, 2022, denying liability. The

 court subsequently entered a discovery scheduling order and the parties exchanged initial disclosures. The parties participated in a mediation in June 2023. The mediation was not successful and the case is currently in the midst of discovery. Discovery deadlines have been extended because counsel for JanOne Inc. and Virland Johnson moved to withdraw on August 18, 2023, which motion the court granted on October 2, 2023. JanOne Inc. and Virland Johnson have until January 4, 2024, to obtain new counsel, after which time the Company anticipates depositions will commence. 
 Board Independence 
 The Company is required by Nasdaq listing standards to have a majority of independent directors. Each year, the Board reviews the relationships that each director has with the Company and with other parties to determine whether each director qualifies as an independent director under Nasdaq listing standards and applicable rules of the SEC. Only those directors who do not have any of the categorical relationships that preclude them from being independent within the meaning of applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules and whom the Board affirmatively determines have no relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director are considered to be independent directors. The Board reviewed a number of factors to evaluate the independence of each of its members. These factors include its members current and historic relationships with the Company and its competitors, suppliers, and customers; their relationships with management and other directors; the relationships their current and former employers have with the Company; and the relationships between the Company and other companies of which a member of the Company s Board of Directors is a director or executive officer. 
 
 After evaluating these factors, the Board of Directors has determined that a majority of the members of the Board, namely Messrs. Butler, Gao, and Sickmeyer, do not have any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities as directors and that each such director is an independent director of the Company within the meaning of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) and the related rules of the SEC. On November 8, 2022, the Company commenced its compensation to Fidelitas Development, of which Mr. Sickmeyer is the sole owner and Chief Executive Officer, for certain marketing consulting services that it provided to the Company. On February 22, 2023, Fidelitas Development received its final compensation for those services for an aggregate of approximately 22,000. While the services provided by Fidelitas Development did not impact Mr. Sickmeyer s status as an independent director, the Board determined that Mr. Sickmeyer was not considered independent solely for purposes of his service on the Audit Committee during the approximate three and one-half-month compensation period. During that period, the Audit Committee took unanimous action and the Board believes that Mr. Sickmeyer s service on the Audit Committee was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
 
 The Board of Directors held three meetings during the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 Board Committees 
 Audit Committee 
 The purpose of our Audit Committee is to assist the Board in overseeing (i) the integrity of our Company s accounting and financial reporting processes, the audits of our financial statements, as well as our systems of internal controls regarding finance, accounting, and legal compliance; (ii) our Company s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; (iii) the qualifications, independence, and performance of our independent public accountants; and (iv) our Company s financial risk. In carrying out this purpose, the Audit Committee maintains and facilitates free and open communication between the Board, the independent public accountants, and our management. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, Messrs. Gao (Chair), Butler, and Sickmeyer served on our Audit Committee. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, each member of the committee, except as described under "Board Independence", satisfied the independence standards specified in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules and the related rules of the SEC and was determined by the Board to be financially literate with accounting or related financial management experience. The Board has also determined that Mr. Gao is an audit committee financial expert as defined under SEC rules and regulations and qualifies as a financially sophisticated audit committee member as required under Rule 5605(c)(2)(A) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The Board has adopted a charter for the Audit Committee, a copy of which is posted on our website at ir.liveventures.com/governance-docs. The Audit Committee met five times during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. 
 Compensation Committee 
 The purpose of the Compensation Committee is to (i) discharge the Board s responsibilities relating to compensation of the Company s directors and executives; (ii) produce an annual report on executive compensation for inclusion in the Company s proxy statement, if necessary; and (iii) oversee and advise the Board on the adoption of policies that govern the Company s compensation programs, including stock and benefit plans. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, Messrs. Butler (Chair) and Gao served on the Compensation Committee. Mr. Sickmeyer began serving on the Compensation Committee beginning in June 2023. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, each member of the 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 committee satisfied the independence standards specified in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules and the related rules of the SEC. In addition, each of the current members of the Compensation Committee is a non-employee director under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act and an outside director for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). The Board has adopted a charter for the Compensation Committee, a copy of which is posted on our website at ir.liveventures.com/governance-docs. The Compensation Committee met two times during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. 
 Governance and Nominating Committee 
 The purpose of the Governance and Nominating Committee is to (i) identify individuals who are qualified to become members of the Board, consistent with criteria approved by the Board, and to select, or to recommend that the Board select, the director nominees for the next annual meeting of stockholders or to fill vacancies on the Board; (ii) develop and recommend to the Board a set of corporate governance principles applicable to our Company; and (iii) oversee the evaluation of the Board and its committees. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, Messrs. Butler (Chair), Gao, and Sickmeyer served on the Governance and Nominating Committee. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, each member of the committee satisfied the independence standards specified in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules and the related rules of the SEC. The Board has adopted a charter for the Governance and Nominating Committee, a copy of which is posted on our website at ir.liveventures.com/governance-docs. The Governance and Nominating Committee met two times during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Governance and Nominating Committee is charged with establishing and periodically reviewing the criteria and qualifications for Board membership and the selection of candidates to serve as directors of our Company. In determining whether to nominate a candidate for director, the Governance and Nominating Committee considers the following criteria, among others: 
 the candidate s integrity and ethical character; 
 the candidate s expertise, business and industry experience, judgement, diversity, age, and length of service; 
 whether the candidate is independent under applicable SEC and rules and regulations; 
 whether the candidate has any conflicts of interest that would materially impair his or her ability to exercise independent judgment as a member of the Board or otherwise discharge the fiduciary duties owed by a director to Live Ventures and our stockholders; and 
 the candidate s ability to represent all of our stockholders without favoring any particular stockholder group or other constituency of Live Ventures. 
 The Governance and Nominating Committee has the authority to retain a search firm to identify director candidates and to approve any fees and retention terms of the search firm s engagement, although it has not recently engaged such a firm. 
 
 Although the Governance and Nominating committee has not specified any minimum criteria or qualifications that each director must meet, it conducts its nominating process in a manner designed to ensure that the Board continues to meet applicable requirements under SEC and Nasdaq rules (including, without limitation, as they relate to the composition of the Audit Committee). 
 The Governance and Nominating Committee will consider director candidates recommended by our stockholders under criteria similar to those used to evaluate candidates nominated by the committee (including those listed above). In considering the potential candidacy of persons recommended by stockholders, however, the committee may also consider the size, duration, and pecuniary interest of the recommending stockholder (or group of stockholders) in our common stock. 
 The Board believes that the continuing service of qualified incumbent directors promotes stability and continuity in the boardroom, giving our Company the benefit of the familiarity and insight into our Company s affairs that its directors have accumulated during their tenure, while contributing to the Board s ability to work as a collective body. Accordingly, the process of the Governance and Nominating Committee for identifying nominees reflects the practice of re-nominating incumbent directors who continue to satisfy the committee s criteria for membership on the Board, who it believes will continue to make important contributions to the Board, and who consent to continue their service on the Board.

 ITEM 11. Executive Compensation 
 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 Overview 
 The purpose of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis CD A is to provide material information about the Company s compensation philosophy, objectives, and other relevant policies and to explain and put into context the material elements of compensation of our named executive officers (in this CD A, referred to as the NEOs ). For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, our NEOs were: 
 Jon Isaac, President and Chief Executive Officer 
 Thomas Sedlak, Chief Executive Officer of Precision Industries, Inc. 
 Eric Althofer, Chief Operating Officer 
 
 Biographical information regarding our NEOs is presented in Item 10 Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance. 
 The Compensation Committee 
 The Compensation Committee reviews the performance and compensation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and the Company s other executive officers. Additionally, the Compensation Committee reviews compensation of outside directors for service on the Board and for service on committees of the Board and administers the Company s stock plans. 
 Role of Executives in Determining Executive Compensation 
 Our President and Chief Executive Officer provides input to the Compensation Committee regarding the performance of the other NEOs and offers recommendations regarding their compensation packages in light of such performance, however the Compensation Committee is ultimately responsible for determining their compensation. 
 Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
 The Compensation Committee and the Board believe that the Company s compensation programs for its executive officers should reflect the Company s performance and the value created for its stockholders. In addition, we believe the compensation programs should support the goals and values of the Company and should reward individual contributions to the Company s success. Specifically, the Company s executive compensation program is intended to: 
 attract and retain the highest caliber executive officers; 
 drive achievement of business strategies and goals; 
 motivate performance in an entrepreneurial, incentive-driven culture; 
 closely align the interests of executive officers with the interests of the Company s stockholders; 
 promote and maintain high ethical standards and business practices; and 
 reward results and the creation of stockholder value.

 Factors Considered in Determining Compensation; Components of Compensation 
 The Compensation Committee makes executive compensation decisions on the basis of total compensation, rather than on individual components of compensation. The Compensation Committee attempts to create an integrated total compensation program structured to balance both short and long-term financial and strategic goals. Our compensation should be competitive enough to attract and retain highly skilled individuals. In this regard, we utilize a combination of two to four of the following types of compensation to compensate our executive officers: 
 base salary; 
 performance bonuses, which may be earned annually depending on the Company s achievement of pre-established goals; 
 cash bonuses given at the discretion of the Board of Directors; and 
 equity compensation, consisting of restricted stock and/or stock options. 
 The Compensation Committee periodically reviews each executive officer s base salary and makes appropriate recommendations to the Board of Directors. Salaries are based on the following factors: 
 the Company s performance for the prior fiscal years and subjective evaluation of each executive s contribution to that performance; 
 the performance of the particular executive in relation to established goals or strategic plans; and 
 competitive levels of compensation for executive positions based on information drawn from compensation surveys and other relevant information. 
 Performance bonuses and equity compensation are awarded based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. Restricted stock is granted under the Company s stockholder-approved equity incentive plan and is priced at 100 of the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. Incentive and/or non-qualified stock options are generally granted under the Company s stockholder-approved equity incentive plan, as well, with the exercise price of such options set forth in the award agreement for such options. These grants are made with a view to linking executives compensation to the long-term financial success of the Company. 
 Use of Benchmarking and Compensation Peer Groups 
 The Compensation Committee did not utilize any benchmarking measure in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and traditionally has not tied compensation directly to a specific profitability measurement, market value of the Company s common stock, or benchmark related to any established peer or industry group. Salary increases are based on the terms of each NEO s employment agreement, if applicable, and correlated with the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee s assessment of each NEO s performance. The Company also generally seeks to increase or decrease compensation, as appropriate, based upon changes in an executive officer s functional responsibilities within the Company. Historically, the Compensation Committee has not used outside consultants in determining the compensation of the NEOs, and no such consultants were engaged during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.

 RECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY AWARDED COMPENSATION 

I. OVERVIEW 
 
 In accordance with the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market (the Nasdaq Rules ), Section 10D and Rule 10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ( Rule 10D-1 ), the Board of Directors (the Board of Live Ventures Incorporated (the Company has adopted this Policy for the Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation (this Policy to provide for the recovery of erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation from Executive Officers. All capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in Section VIII, below. 
 
 II. RECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY AWARDED COMPENSATION 
 
 A. In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company will reasonably promptly recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received in accordance with the Nasdaq Rules and Rule 10D-1 as follows 
 
 1. After an Accounting Restatement, the Compensation Committee (if composed entirely of independent directors, or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of independent directors serving on the Board) (the Committee shall determine the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received by each Executive Officer and shall promptly notify each Executive Officer with a written notice containing the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation and a demand for repayment or return of such compensation, as applicable. 
 
 (a) For Incentive-based Compensation based on (or derived from) the Company s stock price or total stockholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable Accounting Restatement 
 
 i. The amount to be repaid or returned shall be determined by the Committee based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the Company s stock price or total stockholder return upon which the Incentive-based Compensation was Received and 
 
 ii. The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of such reasonable estimate and provide the relevant documentation as required to Nasdaq. 
 
 2. The Committee shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on the particular facts and circumstances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in Section II.B. below, in no event may the Company accept an amount that is less than the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of an Executive Officer s obligations hereunder. 
 
 3. To the extent that the Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Company for any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received under any duplicative recovery obligations 

established by the Company or applicable law, it shall be appropriate for any such reimbursed amount to be credited to the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy. 
 
 4. To the extent that an Executive Officer fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company when due, the Company shall take all actions reasonable and appropriate to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the applicable Executive Officer. The applicable Executive Officer shall be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 
 
 B. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take the actions contemplated by Section II.A. above if the Committee (which, as specified above, is composed entirely of independent directors or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board) determines that recovery would be impracticable and any of the following two conditions are met 
 
 1. The Committee has determined that the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before making this determination, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such attempt(s) and provide such documentation to Nasdaq 
 
 2. Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations thereunder.

Further, the Company shall not enter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive-based Compensation that is granted, paid, or awarded to an Executive Officer from the application of this Policy or that waives the Company s right to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered into before, on or after the Effective Date of this Policy). 
 
 V. ADMINISTRATION AND INTERPRETATION 
 
 This Policy shall be administered by the Committee, and any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding on all affected individuals. The Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy and for the Company s compliance with the Nasdaq Rules, Rule 10D-1, and any other applicable law, regulation, rule, or interpretation of the SEC or Nasdaq promulgated or issued in connection therewith. 
 
 2 

VI. AMENDMENT TERMINATION 
 
 The Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary. Notwithstanding anything in this Section VI to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after considering any actions taken by the Company contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule, or Nasdaq Rule. 
 
 VII. OTHER RECOVERY RIGHTS 
 
 This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and, to the extent required by applicable law or guidance from the SEC or Nasdaq, their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal representatives. The Committee intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent required by applicable law. Any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan, or any other agreement or arrangement with an Executive Officer shall be deemed to include, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, an agreement by the Executive Officer to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Company under applicable law, regulation, or rule or pursuant to the terms of any policy of the Company or any provision in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan, agreement, or other arrangement.
