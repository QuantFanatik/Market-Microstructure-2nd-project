Visium was incorporated in Nevada as Jaguar Investments, Inc. during October 1987. During March 2003, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company merged with Freight Rate, Inc., a development stage company in the logistics software business. During May 2003, the Company changed its name to Power2Ship, Inc. During October 2006, the Company merged with a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, Fittipaldi Logistics, Inc., a Nevada corporation, with the Company surviving but its name changed to Fittipaldi Logistics, Inc. effective November 2006. During December 2007, the Company merged with a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, NuState Energy Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation, with the Company surviving but renamed NuState Energy Holdings, Inc. effective December 2007. In March 2018, the Company brought in a new management team and changed its name to Visium Technologies, Inc. Visium is a provider of cyber security visualization, big data analytics and automation that operates in the traditional cyber security space, as well as in the Internet of Things and data analytics spaces. In March 2019, Visium entered into a software license agreement with MITRE Corporation to license a patented technology known as CyGraph, a tool for cyber warfare analytics, visualization and knowledge management. CyGraph is a military-grade, highly scalable big data analytics tool for cyber security, based on graph database technology. The development of the technology was sponsored by the US Army and is currently in use by the U.S. Army Cyber Command. CyGraph provides advanced analytics for cybersecurity situational awareness that is scalable, flexible and comprehensive. Visium has completed significant proprietary product development efforts to commercialize CyGraph, which the Company has rebranded as TruContext TM . The commercialization efforts included adding functionality to the core technology to make it a native cloud application, adding multi-user and multi-tenant capability, enhancing the graphical user interface, GUI to make the application more intuitive to use, and adding enhanced dashboard and reporting capabilities. TruContext would typically be deployed by an enterprise and be used by the security analyst to intuitively understand the massive amount of data flowing through the network environment, giving the analyst actionable information in real-time to ensure that the network is protected from threats. The analyst will understand the relationships of the assets in the data center, the communication patterns, and cybersecurity exposures, in real-time. TruContext provides visualization, advanced cyber monitoring intelligence, threat hunting, forensic and root cause analysis, data modeling, analytics, and automation to help reduce risk, simplify security, and deliver better security outcomes. Our mission is to help people see and understand data, empowering decision-makers to make more informed and more timely decisions. Our solutions put the power of data into the hands of everyday people, allowing a broad population of business users to engage with their data, ask questions, solve problems, and create value. Our products dramatically reduce the complexity and expense associated with traditional business intelligence applications. Our software allows people to access information, perform analysis, and share results without assistance from technical specialists. By putting powerful analytical technology directly into the hands of people who make decisions with data, we accelerate the pace of informed and intelligent decision-making. Our TruContext platform enables our customers to reduce or streamline their siloed and layered security products, simplifying operations while providing a comprehensive solution. Our solution automates certain previously manual tasks, freeing up personnel to focus on their most important objectives. TruContext can be deployed in a broad range of use cases such as cyber security threat intelligence and forensics, IT/OT critical infrastructure security, supply chain analytics, anti-fraud, law enforcement, compliance, and health care. For example, a breach of your network might go undetected for months, as was the case with the Solar Winds hack that occurred in 2019-2020. In that case the hackers went undetected for 14 months. A Solar Winds type breach may not be preventable, but with TruContext analyzing streaming network data in real-time, this hack would almost certainly have been identified and remediated very quickly by the affected enterprise. TruContext is a very effective tool for proactively and iteratively searching through networks to detect and isolate advanced threats that evade existing security solutions. Should a breach occur, TruContext can quickly perform forensics and root cause analysis, identifying when an incident occurred, how it occurred, and the downstream effects of the incident to the network. One of the top challenges faced by Security practitioners is to keep up with the increase in new cyber attacks while investigating and remediating existing threats. Time is of the essence while investigating potential threats and determining the scope and root-cause of a potential reach. Shortage of resources and experienced personnel continues to limit the ability of companies to conduct thorough investigations. Root cause analysis and forensics are key to intelligently securing the network. TruContext directly addresses these challenges by: Providing real-time comprehensive visualized information on security events, that allow the cyber warrior to immediately pinpoint the root cause of the breach; and know with certainty the priority and required remediation. 4 Table of Contents The real-time ingestion of and visualization of massive amounts of data simplifies the cyber effort, allowing the cyber analyst to intuitively understand the security posture of the organization at a glance. Using TruContext makes the cyber analyst significantly more productive by eliminating false positives and prioritizing threat events. TruContext ingests cyber data from any source , making the data generated by other cyber tools easily understood and actionable. TruContext give the security analyst the ability to combine, layer, filter, and query data with a no-code user interface in a way that no other analytics platform can do. There are some sophisticated and powerful cybersecurity tools currently available, but they all lack one thing providing a comprehensive contextualized understanding of the data. Analysts have too many tools that don t communicate, creating silos of data/information. TruContext brings all the information for a comprehensive visualization. On average, according to CrowdStrike, the time from breach to harm caused by threat actors is 98 minutes making the ability to: 1. Identify malicious hacks in real time; and 2. Perform threat hunting critically important for the security analyst. Using the MITRE ATT CK framework, along with other open source intelligence information, TruContext can hunt threats beyond the physical network boundary so that the analyst fully understands his security posture in real time. TruContext leverages MITRE s ATT CK framework, which is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community. A use case example for TruContext would be in the event sensitive data is being exfiltrated from your network to an external IP address. TruContext has the capability to identify this activity and provide alerts that would allow the cyber analyst to quickly remediate the problem. Another example for TruContext would be the analysis of millions of unemployment insurance claims by a state government that identifies patterns to identify potential fraud. If 30 claims are submitted that are tied to a single bank account, or address, or social security number, TruContext would be able to identify these anomalies in real-time. TruContext offers new methods of uncovering fraud rings and other complex scams with a high level of accuracy through advanced contextual link analysis, and is capable of stopping advanced fraud scenarios in real time. This is currently a significant problem in every state, costing billions of dollars annually. One last example of how TruContext can be used by law enforcement in the context of police investigations. TruContext can analyze highly connected data in real time from any source and make connections which help police solve crime. Connections are quickly made between persons, objects, locations, and events (the POLE model), generating insights into patterns of behaviors and incidents. Using real-time data with TruContext helps investigators be proactive and prevent crime or other incidents, rather than only reacting after an incident has occurred. Visium currently plans to generate revenue in three (3) primary ways: through a virtual appliance model , primarily targeted to the Federal government, charging an annual seat license, with the seat license fee increasing based on the size of the network environment ; through a SaaS model , charging a recurring monthly license fee for TruContext based on the size of the network environment and the number of TruContext Identifiers (nodes); and through professional services to support and deliver cybersecurity solutions and services to its customers, billed on an hourly basis, and delivered through a service contract for implementation and data science services. Partnership Ecosystem We work with a number of technology alliance partners to design go-to-market strategies that combine our platform with products or services provided by our technology alliance partners. These partner integrations deliver more secure solutions and an improved end user experience to their customers. Our technology alliance partnerships focus on security analytics, network and infrastructure security, threat platforms and orchestration, and automation. Visium heavily relies on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers. For example, we host many of our products using third-party data center facilities, and we do not control the operation of these facilities. In addition, we rely on certain technology that we license from third parties, including third-party commercial software and open-source software, which is used with certain of our solutions. 5 Table of Contents Competition The markets for our solutions are highly competitive, and we expect both the requirements and pricing competition to increase, particularly given the increasingly sophisticated attacks, changing customer preferences and requirements, current economic pressures, and market consolidation. Competitive pressures in these markets may result in price reductions, reduced margins, loss of market share and inability to gain market share, and a decline in sales, any one of which could seriously impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We may face competition due to changes in the manner that organizations utilize IT assets and the security solutions applied to them, such as the provision of privileged account security functionalities as part of public cloud providers infrastructure offerings, or cloud-based identity management solutions. Limited IT budgets may also result in competition with providers of other advanced threat protection solutions such as McAfee, LLC, Palo Alto Networks, Splunk Inc., and Dynatrace. We also may compete, to a certain extent, with vendors that offer products or services in adjacent or complementary markets to privileged access management, including identity management vendors and cloud platform providers such as Okta and Tableau. Employees At September 20, 2023, we had 8 full time employees. Our principal offices are located at 4094 Majestic Lane, Suite 360, Fairfax, Virginia 22033. We currently operate in a virtual office arrangement. Our telephone number is (703) 273-0383. Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink under the symbol VISM . Recent Developments Item 1A. Risk Factors The common shares of our Company are considered speculative. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this annual report in evaluating our Company and our business before purchasing our common shares. Our business, operating or financial condition could be harmed due to any of the following risks: Management and our auditors have raised substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern . Our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. Since inception we have experienced recurring net losses which losses caused an accumulated deficit of approximately 59.9 million as of June 30, 2023. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We currently have a working capital deficit and negative cash flow from operations and are uncertain if and when we will be able to pay our current liabilities. Our working capital deficit was approximately 4.25 million as of June 30, 2023. This deficit consists of 9,982 in current assets, offset by 4,263,000 in current liabilities. In addition, we had negative cash flow from operations for the year ended June 30, 2023 of approximately 523,900. We do not have any liquid or other assets that can be liquidated to pay our current liabilities while we continue to incur additional liabilities to our officer and certain service providers who are working to prepare the documents required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to enable our common shares to be registered for trading. Since we currently have limited operations, the only ways we have of paying our current liabilities are to issue our common or preferred shares to our creditors or to issue unsecured promissory notes which may include certain features such as convertibility into common or preferred shares or warrants to purchase additional common or preferred shares in the future. 6 Table of Contents We had 1,865,600 of convertible notes, notes payable, and accrued interest payable as of June 30, 2023, of which 1,547,893 of this amount is past due, and we do not have the funds necessary to pay these obligations. In addition to funding our operating expenses, we need capital to pay various debt obligations totaling approximately 1,547,893 as of June 30, 2023 which are either currently past due or which are due in the current fiscal year. Currently, there is 899,903 principal amount of the convertible notes payable which is past due, 205,000 principal of the notes payable which is past due, and 442,990 of accrued interest which is past due. The interest on the past due principal amounts will continue to accrue monthly at their stated rates. Holders of past due notes do not have a security interest in our assets. The existence of these obligations provides additional challenges to us in our efforts to raise capital to fund our operations. In the event we consummate a transaction with a profitable company, we may not be able to utilize our net operating loss carryover which may have a negative impact on your investment. If we enter into a combination with a business that has operating income, we cannot assure you that we will be able to utilize all or even a portion of our existing net operating loss carryover for federal or state tax purposes following such a business combination. If we are unable to make use of our existing net operating loss carryover, the tax advantages of such a combination may be limited, which could negatively impact the price of our stock and the value of your investment. These factors will substantially increase the uncertainty, and thus the risk, of investing in our shares. Economic conditions may affect our ability to obtain financing and to complete a merger or acquisition. Due to general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries, and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital which we will need. In the presence of these economic conditions, we may have difficulty raising sufficient capital to support the investigation of potential business opportunities, and to consummate a merger or acquisition. These factors substantially increase the uncertainty, and thus the risk, of investing in our shares. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus COVID-19 emerged and has subsequently spread worldwide. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic resulting in federal, state, and local governments mandating various restrictions, including travel restrictions, restrictions on public gatherings, stay at home orders and advisories and quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus. As the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and rapidly changing, the full extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company s operation and financial performance is currently unknown and depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, its impact on capital and financial markets. There are a number of factors related to our common stock which may have an adverse effect on our shareholders. Shareholders interests in our Company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share if we issue additional shares or raise funds through the sale of equity securities. In the event that we are required to issue additional shares, enter into private placements to raise financing through the sale of equity securities or acquire business interests in the future from the issuance of shares of our common stock to acquire such interests, the interests of existing shareholders in our Company will be diluted and existing shareholders may suffer dilution in their net book value per share depending on the price at which such securities are sold. If we do issue additional shares, it will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all existing shareholders. We have certain provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and there are other provisions under Florida law, that may serve to make a takeover of our Company more difficult. Provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent a takeover which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders. Provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects, which include when and by whom special meetings of our stockholders may be called, and may delay, defer, or prevent a takeover attempt. In addition, certain provisions of Florida law also may be deemed to have certain anti-takeover effects which include that control of shares acquired in excess of certain specified thresholds will not possess any voting rights unless these voting rights are approved by a majority of a corporation s disinterested stockholders. Voting power of our shareholders is highly concentrated by insiders. Our officers and directors control, either directly or indirectly, a substantial portion of our voting securities. As of June 30, 2023, our executive officer and directors beneficially owns 4,640,950 shares of Common Stock, or approximately 16 of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. In addition, our executive officer owns the only issued and outstanding share of Series AA Convertible Preferred Stock which entitles him to 51 of the Common votes on any matter requiring a shareholder vote. Therefore, our management may significantly affect the outcome of all corporate actions and decisions for an indefinite period of time including the election of directors, amendment of charter documents and approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. 7 Table of Contents Our common stock is quoted in the over the counter market on the OTC Pink. Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink. OTC Pink offers a quotation service to companies that are unable to list their securities on an exchange or for companies, such as ours, whose securities are not eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. The requirements for quotation on the OTC Pink are considerably lower and less regulated than those of the OTC Bulletin Board or an exchange. Because our common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink, it is possible that even fewer brokers or dealers would be interested in making a market in our common stock which further adversely impacts its liquidity. The tradability of our common stock is limited under the penny stock regulations which may cause the holders of our common stock difficulty should they wish to sell their shares. Because the quoted price of our common stock is less than 5.00 per share, our common stock is considered a penny stock, and trading in our common stock is subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, broker/dealers who recommend low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special sales practice requirements. The broker/dealer must make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written consent prior to the transaction. SEC regulations also require additional disclosure in connection with any trades involving a penny stock, including the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and its associated risks. These requirements severely limit the liquidity of securities in the secondary market because few broker or dealers are likely to undertake these compliance activities and this limited liquidity will make it more difficult for an investor to sell his shares of our common stock in the secondary market should the investor wish to liquidate the investment. In addition to the applicability of the penny stock rules, other risks associated with trading in penny stocks could also be price fluctuations and the lack of a liquid market. Item 1B.

The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview The Company was incorporated in Nevada as Jaguar Investments, Inc. during October 1987. During March 2003, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company merged with Freight Rate, Inc., a development stage company in the logistics software business. During May 2003, the Company changed its name to Power2Ship, Inc. During October 2006, the Company merged with a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, Fittipaldi Logistics, Inc., a Nevada corporation, with the Company surviving but its name changed to Fittipaldi Logistics, Inc. effective November 2006. During December 2007, the Company merged with a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, NuState Energy Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation, with the Company surviving but renamed NuState Energy Holdings, Inc. effective December 2007. In March 2019, the Company changed its name to Visium Technologies, Inc. Since February 12, 2018 Mark Lucky has served as Chairman and CEO. He also currently serves as CFO. The Company s headquarters is located at 4094 Majestic Lane, Suite 360, Fairfax, VA 22124. Since February 2018, the Company has focused on creating a world-class cybersecurity/digital risk management company, with a focus on network security, threat visualization, pinpoint threat identification, and big-data analytics. Our solutions address the growing security and compliance complexities and risks resulting from the increasing adoption of cloud computing and the proliferation of geographically dispersed IT assets. In March 2019, Visium entered into a software license agreement with MITRE Corporation to license a patented technology, known as TruContext, a tool for cyber warfare analytics, visualization, and knowledge management. TruContext is a military-grade highly scalable big data analytics tool for Cybersecurity, based on graph database technology. The development of the technology was sponsored by, and is currently in use by US Army Cyber Command. TruContext provides advanced analytics for cybersecurity situational awareness that is scalable, flexible, and comprehensive. Visium has completed significant proprietary product development efforts to commercialize TruContext. During fiscal 2022 the Company rebranded TruContext as TruContext TM to reflect the enhanced version of the software tool which resulted from significant proprietary development of the software. 10 Table of Contents Results of Operations Development Expense For the year ended June 30, 2023, development expense totaled 214,965 as compared to 361,298 for the year ended June 30, 2022, a decrease of 146,333 or approximately 40.5 . Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses For the year ended June 30, 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses were 2,198,639 as compared to 4,316,191 for the year ended June 30, 2022, a decrease of 2,117,552 or approximately 49 . For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 selling, general and administrative expenses consisted of the following: 2023 2022 Increase/ (Decrease) Change Accounting expense 87,521 61,283 26,238 43 Consulting fees 135,020 44,575 90,445 203 Salaries 1,007,364 1,001,435 5,929 1 Legal and professional fees 41,150 488,995 (447,845 (91 Travel expense 13,318 15,512 (2,194 (14 Occupancy expense 2,569 1,702 867 51 Telephone expense 4,611 4,037 574 14 Marketing expense 2,465 203,527 (201,062 (99 Website expense 61 34,505 (34,444 (100 Investor relations expense 13,688 - 13,688 N/A Stock based consulting expense 74,226 385,329 (311,103 (81 Stock based compensation 782,275 1,936,633 (1,154,358 (60 Other 34,371 138,658 (104,287 (75 2,198,639 4,316,191 (2,117,552 (49 The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2023, when compared with the prior year, is primarily due to a decrease in stock-based consulting expense of 311,103, stock based compensation of 1,154,358, a decrease in marketing expense of 201,062 and a decrease in legal and professional fees of 447,845, offset by an increase in consulting fees of 90,445, and an increase in accounting expense of 26,238. 11 Table of Contents Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability Years ended June 30, 2023 2022 Gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities 17,363 1,119 Changes in fair value of derivative liabilities results from the changes in the fair value of the derivative liability due to the application of ASC 815, resulting in either income or expense, depending on the difference in fair value of the derivative liabilities between their measurement dates. The increase in fair value of derivative liabilities recognized during fiscal 2023 is primarily due to a change in accounting estimate related to the accounting for derivative liabilities as a result of a decrease in share price. Derivative Liability Expense Years Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Change Derivative liability expense 62,773 - N/A The Company issued convertible notes in January 2023 and June 2023 which provisions contained variable price conversion terms, resulting in a derivative liability expense, measured as of the issuance date of the notes. Interest Expense Years Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Change Interest Expense 334,847 705,075 (53 Interest expense represents the stated interest of notes and convertible notes payable as well as the amortization of debt discount. The decrease in interest expense during fiscal 2023 is primarily due to higher discount amortization expense of 468,344 in fiscal 2022. Loss on extinguishment of debt Years Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Change Loss on extinguishment of debt 516,987 - N/A In September 2022 we issued 138,667 warrants with a five year life, and a fixed exercise price of 1.35 per share, as part of a modification to three outstanding convertible notes payable. The Company evaluated these amendments under ASC 470-50, Debt - Modification and Extinguishment , and concluded that the issuance of these warrants in exchange for deferring the interim interest payments that were due resulted in significant and consequential changes to the economic substance of the debt and thus resulted in accounting for these modifications as an extinguishment of the debt. Under ASC 470-50, the issuance of these warrants resulted in a loss on the extinguishment of debt, as follows: Value of warrants issued 186,972 Write-off of unamortized debt discount 317,953 Loss on extinguishment of debt 504,925 12 Table of Contents During the year ended June 30, 2023 we recorded a loss on the conversion of convertible note totaling 12,062, which is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as loss on extinguishment of debt. A recap of the Loss on extinguishment of debt follows: Loss on extinguishment of debt related to warrants 504,925 Loss on extinguishment of debt related to note conversions 12,062 516,987 Gain on Debt Write-Off Years Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Gain on debt write off/conversions - 187,930 Liquidity and Capital Resources Balance at June 30, 2023 2022 Cash 9,982 136,990 Accounts payable and accrued expenses (845,502 (596,464 Accrued compensation (1,371,879 (614,589 Notes, convertible notes, and accrued interest (1,865,630 (1,684,199 At June 30, 2023 our total assets consisted of cash. At June 30, 2022 100 our total assets consisted of cash. We do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures. The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have ready access to sufficient funds to meet commitments and effectively implement our growth strategy. Our primary sources are financing activities such as the issuance of notes payable and convertible notes payable. In the past, we have mostly relied on debt and equity financing to provide for our operating needs. We were unable to generate sufficient funds from operations to fund our ongoing operating requirements through June 30, 2023. As of September 20, 2023, we had approximately 100,000 on hand. We may need to raise funds to enhance our working capital and use them for strategic purposes. If such need arises, we intend to generate proceeds from either debt or equity financing. We intend to finance our operations using equity financing. We do not anticipate incurring capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will need to raise approximately 180,000 per year in the near term to finance the recurring costs of being a publicly traded company. 13 Table of Contents Going Concern Ther accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company has used net cash in its operating activities of 523,886 and 2,224,576 during the years ended June 30 2023 and 2022, respectively, and has a working capital deficit of approximately 4.3 million and 2.8 million at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, to fund possible future acquisitions, and to generate profitable operations in the future, once a merger with an operating company is consummated. Management plans may continue to provide for its capital requirements by issuing additional equity securities and debt and the Company will continue to find possible acquisition targets. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances that, if achieved, the Company will have sufficient funds to execute its business plan or generate positive operating results.

Cash from financing activities was obtained through the sale of common stock that netted the Company 40,250, the sale of convertible notes that netted the Company 140,000, and the sale of promissory notes that netted the Company 190,000. Year ended June 30, 2022 Net cash used in operations in fiscal year 2022 increased by 1,525,536 or 192 from fiscal year 2021. This cash was obtained through the sale of common stock that netted the Company 1,500,000, and three convertible notes that netted the Company 1,170,000. 14 Table of Contents Capital Raising Transactions Issuance of Convertible Notes Payable We generated net proceeds of 140,000 and 1,170,000 during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, from the issuance of convertible notes payable. Convertible Notes Payable The Company had convertible promissory notes aggregating approximately 937,576 and 1,074,487 outstanding at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The accrued interest amounted to approximately 228,831 and 261,300 at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There is no provision in the note agreements for adjustments to the interest rates on these notes in the event of default. The convertible notes payable bear interest at rates ranging between 10 and 18 per annum. Interest is generally payable monthly. The Convertible Notes Payable are generally convertible at rates ranging between 0.20 and 22,500,000 per share, at the holders option. Balance at Balance at June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Convertible notes payable 937,576 1,487,431 Discount on convertible notes - (412,944 Notes payable, net of discount 937,576 1,074,487 Notes Payable The Company had promissory notes aggregating approximately 380,013 at June 30, 2023 and 205,000 at June 30, 2022. The related accrued interest amounted to approximately 224,000 and 226,300 at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There is no provision in the note agreements for adjustments to the interest rates on these notes in the event of default. The notes payable bear interest at rates between 0 and 16 per annum. Interest is generally payable monthly. 205,000 of these notes have matured as of June 30, 2023. We generated net proceeds of 190,000 during fiscal 2023 from the issuance of short-term notes payable. Common Stock Warrants In January and February 2021, we issued 39,371 warrants with a two-year life, and fixed exercise prices ranging from 0.0055 to 0.02 per share. An additional 9,239,130 warrant shares were issued due to repricing certain warrants with a 0.02 exercise price to a 0.0115 exercise price. In September 2022, we issued 138,667 warrants with a five year life, and a fixed exercise price of 1.35 per share, as part of a modification to three outstanding convertible notes payable. The Company evaluated these amendments under ASC 470-50, Debt - Modification and Extinguishment , and concluded that the issuance of these warrants in exchange for deferring the interim interest payments that were due resulted in significant and consequential changes to the economic substance of the debt and thus resulted in accounting for these modifications as an extinguishment of the debt. Under ASC 470-50, the issuance of these warrants resulted in a loss on the extinguishment of debt, as follows: Value of warrants issued 186,972 Write-off of unamortized debt discount 317,953 Loss on extinguishment of debt 504,925 15 Table of Contents A summary of the status of the Company s outstanding common stock warrants as of June 30, 2023 and changes during the fiscal year ending on that date is as follows: Number of Weighted Average Warrants Exercise Price Common Stock Warrants Balance at beginning of year 5,049 14.85 Granted 138,667 1.35 Granted due to repricing 5,048,426 0.0169 Exercised (68,755 1.35 Forfeited (8,180 1.35 Balance at end of period 5,115,207 0.025 Warrants exercisable at end of period 5,115,207 0.025 Derivative Liability The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments on its balance sheet at fair value. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Climate Change Our opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations. Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our understanding of the results of our business operations. We discuss the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations throughout Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. In the ordinary course of business, we have made a number of estimates and assumptions in preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. The following critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We consider the following accounting policies to be those most important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial condition: Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB ), Accounting Standards Codification ASC ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). Revenues are recognized when control is transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods. Revenue recognition is evaluated through the following five steps: (i) identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; (ii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determination of the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognition of revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied. The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control is transferred upon delivery to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products. In the event any discounts, sales incentives, or similar arrangements are agreed to with a customer, such amounts are estimated at time of sale and deducted from revenue. Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. 16 Table of Contents Convertible Instruments - The Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815. ASC 815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments in accordance with EITF 00-19. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional (as that term is described). The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) in accordance with the provisions of ASC 470 20 Debt with Conversion Options Accordingly, the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records when necessary deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. The Company believes the certain conversion features embedded in convertible notes payable are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the Company s stock price. Accordingly, the Company has recognized derivative liabilities in connection with such instruments. The Company uses judgment in determining the fair value of derivative liabilities at the date of issuance at every balance sheet thereafter. The Company uses judgment in determining which valuation is most appropriate for the instrument (e.g., Cox, Ross Rubinstein Binomial Tree valuation model), the expected volatility, the implied risk-free interest rate, as well as the expected dividend rate. Share-Based Compensation We compute share-based payments in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation and related interpretations. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at the fair value of the share-based payments. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the grants. Restricted stock awards are granted at the discretion of the compensation committee of our board of directors (the Board of Directors ). These awards are restricted as to the transfer of ownership and generally vest over the requisite service periods (vesting on a straight line basis). The fair value of a stock award is equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the grant date. We estimate the fair value of stock options and warrants by using the Cox, Ross Rubinstein Binomial Tree model. The Cox, Ross Rubinstein valuation model requires the development of assumptions that are inputs into the model. These assumptions are the expected stock volatility, the risk free interest rate, the expected life of the option, the dividend yield on the underlying stock and the expected forfeiture rate. Expected volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected term of the option. Risk free interest rates are calculated based on continuously compounded risk free rates for the appropriate term. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of equity based payment awards requires the input of the subjective assumptions described above. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of equity based payment awards represent management s best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment. We are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. We account for share based payments granted to non employees in accordance with ASC 505 50, Equity Based Payments to Non Employees. We determine the fair value of the stock based payment as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more readily determinable. If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either (1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date at which the counterparty s performance is complete. Derivative Instruments We enter into financing arrangements that consist of freestanding derivative instruments or are hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivative features. We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure such derivative instruments at fair values with gains or losses recognized in earnings. Embedded derivatives that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract are bifurcated and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss in earnings. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are estimated using various techniques (and combinations thereof) that are considered consistent with the objective measuring fair values. In selecting the appropriate technique, the nature of the instrument, the market risks that it embodies and the expected means of settlement are considered. Estimating fair values of derivative financial instruments requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors. In addition, option-based techniques (such as the Cox, Ross Rubinstein model) are highly volatile and sensitive to changes in the trading market price of our common stock. Since derivative financial instruments are initially and subsequently carried at fair values, our income (expense) going forward will reflect the volatility in these estimates and assumption changes. 17 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Not applicable. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The information required by this item is included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, who at June 30, 2023 was also our principal executive and financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, including ensuring that such material information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023. In making this assessment, our management used criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Guidance for Smaller Public Companies. During our assessment of the design and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, management identified the following material weaknesses: While we have processes in place, there are no formal written policies and procedures related to certain financial reporting processes; There is no formal documentation in which management specified financial reporting objectives to enable the identification of risks, including fraud risks; Our Board of Directors consists of six members, however, we lack the resources and personnel to implement proper segregation of duties or other risk mitigation systems. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected by us in a timely manner. A significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the registrant s financial reporting. We intend to gradually improve our internal control over financial reporting to the extent that we can allocate resources to such improvements. We intend to prioritize the design of our internal control over financial reporting starting with our control environment and risk assessments and ending with control activities, information and communication activities, and monitoring activities. Although we believe the time to adapt in the next year will help position us to provide improved internal control functions into the future, in the interim, these changes caused control deficiencies, which in the aggregate resulted in a material weakness. Due to the existence of these material weaknesses, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2023. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit smaller reporting companies to provide only the management s report in this annual report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The Audit Committee will also prepare the report that SEC rules require be included in our annual proxy statement.

A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is available on our website at www.visiumtechnologies.com under Investor Relations . Compensation Committee .

The Compensation Committee was appointed by the Board to discharge the Board s responsibilities relating to: compensation of our executives, equity-based compensation plans, including, without limitation, stock option and restricted stock plans, in which officers or employees may participate and arrangements with executive officers relating to their employment relationships with our company, including employment agreements, severance agreements, supplemental pension, or savings arrangements, change in control agreements and restrictive covenants.

Such persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. To our knowledge, based solely on our review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required to be filed during fiscal 2022, we believe that for fiscal 2023, all required reports were filed on a timely basis under Section 16(a), except for Dr Esaka, who had not yet filed his initial Form 3 or subsequent Form 4 and Form 5. 21 Table of Contents Code of Ethics We have adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct to provide guiding principles to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer or controller of our company in the performance of their duties.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Visium Technologies, Inc (the Company) as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Explanatory Paragraph Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses as of June 30, 2023. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company had a net loss of 3,310,848 and net cash used in operating activities of 523,886, and had negative working capital of 4,253,314. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters. We have served as the Company s auditor since 2017. October 5, 2023 F-2 Table of Contents VISIUM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. For the year ended June 30, 2023 we had a net loss of , had net cash used in operating activities of and had negative working capital of . These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date of this filing. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, to fund possible future acquisitions, and to generate profitable operations in the future. Management plans to provide for the Company s capital requirements by continuing to issue additional equity and debt securities. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances that, if achieved, the Company will have sufficient funds to execute its business plan or generate positive operating results. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. F-7 Table of Contents Cash and Cash Equivalents Concentration of Credit Risks .

Because it is indeterminate whether there is a sufficient number of authorized and unissued shares exists at the assessment date, the Company calculates a derivative liability associated with the warrants in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815-40-25. Accounting for Derivative Warrant Liability The Company s derivative warrant instruments have been measured at fair value at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, using the Cox, Ross Rubinstein Binomial Tree valuation model. The Company recognizes the derivative liability related to those warrants that contain price protection features in its consolidated balance sheet as liabilities. The liability is revalued at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recognized currently in the consolidated statements of operations. The initial recognition and subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative warrant liability have no effect on the Company s cash flows. Derivative liability convertible notes The Company has certain convertible notes with variable price conversion terms. Upon the issuance of these convertible notes and as a consequence of their conversion features, the convertible notes give rise to embedded derivative liabilities. The Company s derivative liabilities related to its convertible notes payable have been measured at fair value at June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 using the Cox, Ross Rubinstein Binomial Tree valuation model.
