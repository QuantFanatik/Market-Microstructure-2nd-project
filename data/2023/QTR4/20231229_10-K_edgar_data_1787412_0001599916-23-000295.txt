History 

We
were ori ginally incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 30, 2019, under the name Business
Solutions Plus, Inc. 

On

Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director. 

On
February 9, 2021, the Company filed, with the Secretary of State of Nevada NSOS ), Restated Articles of Incorporation. 

On
March 4, 2021, Business Solutions Plus, Inc., (the Company or Successor announced on Form 8-K plans to participate
in a holding company reorganization the Reorganization or Merger with InterActive Leisure Systems, Inc. IALS or Predecessor ), the Company and Business Solutions Merger Sub, Inc. Merger Sub ), collectively
(the Constituent Corporations pursuant to NRS 92A.180, NRS A.200, NRS 92A.230 and NRS 92A.250. 

Immediately
prior to the Reorganization, the Company was a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of Interactive Leisure Systems, Inc. and Business Solutions
Merger Sub, Inc. was a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

As
disclosed in our 8-K filed on March 26, 2021, the above-mentioned Reorganization was legally effective as of March 31, 2021. 

Each
share of Predecessor s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Successor common stock. The control shareholder, (at the time) of the Predecessor, Flint
Consulting Services, LLC, Flint a Wyoming limited liability company became the same control shareholder of the Successor.
Jeffrey DeNunzio, as sole member of Flint was deemed to be the indirect and beneficial holder of 405,516,868 shares of Common Stock and
1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company representing, at the time, approximately 93.70 voting control of the Company.
Paul Moody, (our now former sole officer/director), was the same officer/director of the Predecessor. There was no other shareholder(s)
or any officer/director holding at least 5 of the outstanding voting shares of the Company. 

 Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and under the respective articles of incorporation of Predecessor and Successor, the Successor Capital Stock
had the same designations, rights, and powers and preferences, and the qualifications, limitations, and restrictions thereof, as the
Predecessor Capital Stock which was automatically converted pursuant to the reorganization. 

 Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Successor, as the holding company, contain provisions identical
to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Predecessor immediately prior to the merger, other than as permitted by NRS 92A.200. 

 Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of Predecessor stated that any act or transaction by or involving the Predecessor,
other than the election or removal of directors of the Predecessor, that requires for its adoption under the NRS or the Articles of Incorporation
of Predecessor the approval of the stockholders of the Predecessor, shall require in addition the approval of the stockholders of Successor
(or any successor thereto by merger), by the same vote as is required by the articles of Incorporation and/or the bylaws of the Predecessor.

prior to the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Successor and Merger Sub were identical to the articles of incorporation
and bylaws of Predecessor immediately prior to the merger, other than as permitted by NRS 92A.200;

Boards of Directors of Predecessor, Successor, and Merger Sub approved the Reorganization, shareholder approval not being required pursuant
to NRS 92A.180;

Reorganization constituted a tax-free organization pursuant to Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code;

previously listed and traded until the new ticker symbol BSPI was announced April 14, 2021, on the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority s daily list with a market effective date of April 15, 2021. The CUSIP Number 45841W107 for IALS s common stock
was suspended upon market effectiveness. The Company received a new CUSIP Number 12330M107. 

 After
completion of the Holding Company Reorganization, the Company cancelled all of its stock held in Predecessor resulting in the Company
as a stand-alone and separate entity with no subsidiaries, no assets and negligible liabilities. The Company abandoned the business plan
of its Predecessor and resumed its former business plan of a blank check company after completion of the Merger. 

 On
May 4, 2021, Business Solutions Plus, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (the Company ), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement

Japanese
Food-Service Market 

The
Japanese Food-Service Market is Segmented by Type (Full-service Restaurants, Quick Service Restaurants, Cafes, Bars, 100 Home Delivery
Restaurants, Street Stalls and Kiosks) and Structure (Independent Consumer Food Service and Chained Consumer Food Service). We believe
Japanese consumers, in general, tend to be highly demanding, putting great emphasis on quality and branding and are willing to spend
more resources on value-added products. 1 

The
Japanese food service market was valued at USD 142.84 billion in 2020, and it is projected to witness a CAGR of 0.84 during the forecast
period, 2021 - 2026. The coronavirus pandemic has made short-term projections hard to predict, with sales in March 2020 down almost 40 
for some food companies. Japanese food service operators, which rely on lunch and dinner demand from business workers, are also suffering
as more companies have employees working from home at the government s request. 1 

According
to a report released by TableCheck Inc., the percentage of reservations (dining reservations) being canceled increased about 3.6 times
before the pandemic for groups of 10 or more. A French restaurant and bar named Scene near Hachioji Station on the Keio Line, earlier
in June 2020, launched take-out and delivery services which we believe many others will begin offering if not already, due in part to
the changing attitudes of dining out as a result of the pandemic. We believe take-out and delivery services, along with menu options
that are quick to prepare, increasing in consumer demand. 1 

The
variety of restaurants and menu items available in the Japanese food service industry continues to expand in the country, as Japanese
consumers are interested in trying a new and vast variety of cuisines, which are available at their convenience in Japan. Food from Europe,
Asia, Australia, and the Americas are becoming increasingly popular, partly due to a large number of Japanese traveling abroad every
year. 

The
Japanese food service market is highly competitive, with a major market share held by prominent companies, such as McDonald s Corporation,
Yum! Brands Inc., Zensho Holdings Co. Ltd, Skylark Group, MOS Food Services Inc., and Yoshinoya Holdings Co. Ltd. Zensho Holdings Co.
Ltd, with the largest market share of 2.76 in 2020, emerging as the market leader, and Skylark Group holding the second-largest share
with 1.66 . 1 

Currently,
in the Japanese market, hamburgers and related fast-food options have been prevalent, with high-end gourmet hamburgers being in the most
expensive category consisting usually of single restaurant locations, followed by lesser expensive hamburger options via chain restaurants
such as Shake Shack and MOS Premiums. The size of the current market for hamburgers in Japan is approximately 6.6 Billion (2020), and
has been steadily increasing ever since 2015. It is also projected to grow by approximately 5 over the next few years. Hamburgers are
considered to be one of the few food categories that were not affected by COVID-19 in Japan and were able to take advantage of home deliveries
and to-go orders during the pandemic. (Source: Fuji Keizai Group 2020.)

Business
Information 

WB
Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., referred to herein as WBJ , which we operate through and share the same business plan of, holds
the rights to the Master Franchise Agreement with Jakes Franchising LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability
Company, as it pertains to the establishment and operation of Wayback Burger Restaurants within the country of Japan. 

The

license affiliated and unaffiliated third parties Franchisees to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurants in
the Country of Japan, this agreement lasts for a term of twenty years, unless it is terminated sooner in accordance with terms outlined
in the Master Franchise Agreement, and may be extended one additional, consecutive term of ten years. In exchange for such rights, we
paid Jake s Franchising 2,700,000 USD, and we must pay an additional 10,000 for each additional company operated Wayback Burgers
restaurant and for each sub-franchised location the fee is either 10,000 or 28.57 of the initial franchise fee collected for such Restaurant,
whichever is greater. Additionally, there is also a royalty fee in the amount of three percent (3 of the Gross Sales of all Company-Operated
Wayback Burgers Restaurants in the Country and the greater of two percent (2 of the Gross Sales of all Franchised Wayback Burgers Restaurants
in the Country or forty percent (40 of the royalty fees collected for all Franchised Wayback Burgers Restaurants in the Country. The
Master Franchise Agreement, amongst other things, also provides WBJ the right of first refusal to enter into a subsequent

Indonesia, Malaysia (Eastern Malaysia only, Western Malaysia if it becomes available as it is currently licensed to another party), the

The
Master Franchise Agreement dictates specific duties we must perform which include, but are not limited to, providing Jake s Franchising

Burgers restaurant by the end of the 2022 calendar year, three restaurants by the end of the 2023 calendar year, and an additional three
restaurants must open, and remain in operation, every following year until December 31, 2041, at which time we must have sixty Wayback
Burgers restaurants open and in operation. If we fail to meet these targets, then we would need to renegotiate terms with Jake s
Franchising, or we could potentially lose our master franchise rights in their entirety. As of the date of this report, the Company has
not adhered to the stipulated requirements outlined in the Master Franchise Agreement concerning the establishment of additional restaurant
locations. While the Company has received informal assurance, through verbal discussions with representatives of Jake s Franchising,
that no penalties will be imposed, there remains the potential for Jake s Franchising to exercise their discretion and terminate
the Master Franchise Agreement unless the Company achieves full compliance with all specified terms. In the event of such termination,
the Company s operational outcomes would be adversely affected, necessitating a significant alteration of our business plan, or
potentially raising questions about the feasibility of sustaining our operations. 

For
full terms and details of the Master Franchise Agreement, one can view a complete copy which has been filed as an exhibit to the Form
8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 16, 2021. 

WB
Burgers Japan Co., Ltd. seeks to make Wayback Burgers a nationally recognized brand, if not a household name, within the
country of Japan through the promotion and opening of various Wayback Burgers Restaurants. 

Following
the acquisition of our wholly owned subsidiary, WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., on September 14, 2021, we ceased to be a shell company. Immediately
upon our acquisition of WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd. we adopted the same business plan as WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd. 

Background 

The
first Wayback Burgers, previously known as Jake s Wayback Burgers, began with a single location in Newark, Delaware approximately
thirty-one years ago in 1991, offering a combination of burgers, hot dogs, fries, milkshakes, and other similar menu options. Since then,
it has reached a global scale with a presence in the US, Europe, Africa, and Asia with hundreds of corporate owned restaurants and over
five hundred franchise locations worldwide offering much of the same comfort items many have grown accustomed to, with the addition of
a few menu items specifically geared toward the pallets of those in various demographics. 

The
products we seek to offer in our anticipated location(s), and those we seek to franchise to within Japan, will also offer many of the
same product offerings many are accustomed to elsewhere such as hamburgers, hot dogs chicken sandwiches, hand-dipped milkshakes, various
side dishes, fresh salad, kid s meals, refreshing drinks and alcoholic beverages. We intend to source our ingredients in any of
our current or future location(s) from highly regarded local Japanese suppliers in order to satisfy the food quality standards as set
by Wayback Burgers Inc., within the United States. 

Our
First Location 

On
November 9, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary, WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., consummated a lease agreement with Arai Co., Ltd., a Japanese
realty group, for the location in which we now operate our first Wayback Burgers restaurant. The property is located in the popular shopping
plaza of Omotesando, located in the Tokyo prefecture, in the country of Japan. We believe the high volume of foot traffic and shopping
will yield a large group of patrons seeking to try our product offerings. 

On
March 11, 2022 we opened our first flagship Wayback Burgers location to the public in the Omotesando shopping plaza in Japan. We offer
an array of quick bites, including, but not limited to, traditional hamburgers, fries, shakes, and other alternatives. 

Other
Current Locations 

In
August of 2022, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., entered into and consummated a rental agreement
with Kitchen Depot for a ghost kitchen in the Tamachi neighborhood of Minato, Tokyo, Japan. Following notice provided to
Kitchen Depot in September of 2023, in November of 2023, we terminated our rental agreement with Kitchen Depot and we ceased all operations
through our, now former, ghost kitchen location in Tamachi. The Company has no plans to resume operations at this location at any juncture,
as it believes this location is unlikely to be profitable, considering the low volume of orders it received while this location was operational. 

On
October 1, 2023, an agreement was established between our company and Next Meats Co., Ltd., spanning a three-year duration, concerning
the licensing of logos and related assets. Subsequently, in November 2023, the operation of a ghost kitchen named "NEXT Restaurant" commenced
at our flagship Omotesando location. This initiative stems from a collaboration between our company and Next Meats Holdings, Inc., particularly
its subsidiary Next Meats Co., Ltd., aimed at opening a venue offering Next Meats menu selections, including, amongst other menu items,
the prominently featured "NEXT Pizza". 

The
majority of menu items available at this ghost kitchen are sourced from Mama Foods Co., Ltd., a manufacturer of products for Next Meats
Holdings, Inc. Consequently, 1 of the sales generated at this restaurant location are remitted to Next Meats Co., Ltd., as part of the
collaborative agreement. 

From
time to time, we purchase food products that we offer through our menu items from Mama Foods Co., Ltd., a Japanese Company owned and
controlled by our sole officer and director, Koichi Ishizuka. 

Koichi
Ishizuka is an executive officer and director of Next Meats Holdings, Inc., and through his direct and indirect ownership of Next Meats
Holdings, Inc., he is deemed to be the controlling shareholder of Next Meats Holdings, Inc. 

Mobile
Application 

The
Company has entered the final stage of development for its own mobile application for food delivery services. At present, the Company
is finalizing development, and is in the process of finalizing plans for the launch of the application, hiring delivery staff, etc. However,
there is currently no specific timeframe established for the intended launch of the mobile application.

Marketing
Strategy 

In
order to grow an initial customer base, from which we intend to launch future expansion efforts, our marketing strategy begins with the
physical location of our flagship restaurant. Our current location in Omotesando is in a shopping center with high foot-traffic that
can serve to attract not only customers, but also future franchisee prospects throughout Japan. For future franchisee locations, we intend
to identify areas where competitors are not already located, such as road-side in the outskirts of major cities, and open our restaurants
in these areas. 

However,
we do not intend to rely solely on our physical location in order to attract customers, we also are in the early stages of our marketing
stratagem comprised, in part, of SNS (social networking service) marketing through collaboration with influencers and celebrities, magazine
advertisements, and expansive television and media appearances. 

Wayback
Burgers in Japan intends to position itself as a newly entered and authentic American hamburger brand, comparable to our competitor Shack
Shake, while contrasting ourselves through offering higher quality foods at competitive price points. We plan to achieve this by focusing
on the ingredients, such as the option of vegetables in our hamburgers, the increased diameter of our meat patties, and the overall volume
of our menu items. 

Expansion
Plans 

We
have forecasted our expansion plans over the next few years, however, as we have a limited operating history, we may find that our plans
may be materially altered, expanded, or curtailed as dictated by market forces at the time. As such, our expansion plans should be read
as a framework for our future goals, but not a guarantee that we will carry out any or all such operations in the indicated timeline. 

At
present, our expansion plans are as follows: 

-
On March 11, 2022, we opened our first flagship Wayback Burgers location to the public in the Omotesando shopping plaza in Japan. We
offer an array of quick bites, including, but not limited to, traditional hamburgers, fries, shakes, and other alternatives. We intend
to utilize our franchise location to host meetings with all franchise candidates. In addition to our general marketing plans, which includes
social media and internet advertising, we intend to utilize our flagship location to showcase any collaborative events/activities that
we may engage in, which we believe may assist us in garnering the interest of future franchisees. 

-
By the conclusion of 2024, we are aiming to open five Wayback Burgers restaurants throughout Japan, with one of these restaurants directly
managed by us while the remaining four would ideally be franchise locations. This number may increase or decrease depending on the results
of our operations. 

-
Additionally, by the conclusion of 2024, we intend to execute another master franchise agreement in Asia for the right to open Wayback
Burgers restaurants in another Asian country or territory. We have not yet identified which country or territory we will seek to acquire
these rights for first. As noted previously, we have the right of first refusal to enter into a subsequent Master Franchise Agreement
with Jake s Franchising, LLC to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurants in the Countries of Indonesia, Malaysia (Eastern
Malaysia only, Western Malaysia if it becomes available as it is currently licensed to another party), the Philippines, Vietnam, China,
India, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, and Taiwan. 

Partnerships 

The
company believes partnerships are a vital means to expansion and that partnerships with other food institutions or distributors may allow
the Company to provide menu items that might appeal to a larger demographic within the Japanese market. 

Our
current Officer and Director, Koichi Ishizuka has existing ties and relationships with Next Meats Co., Ltd. a Japanese plant alternative
meat company, that produces and sells plant-based foods (predominantly meat alternatives) to consumers. As a result of the collaboration
with Next Meats Co., Ltd., at our flagship Wayback Burgers restaurant we have been able to add alternative meat options into its menu,
we have opened the NEXT Restaurant ghost kitchen at our Omotesando location, and in the future we may create custo mized
menu options as provided by Next Meats Co., Ltd. Menu alterations are subject to approval by Jake s Franchising, LLC. It is the
belief of management that such offerings can gain a larger market share in the country of Japan allowing for greater growth potential.
However, such plans are speculative and may not materialize. It is also possible that if such plans do materialize, they may not result
in the expected level of growth the Company forecasts as a result of the partnership or partnerships it enters into. Additionally, we
may explore the possibility of entering into an agreement with Dr. Foods, Inc., a company in the alternative meat industry
which has common management with the Company. 

It
should be noted that Koichi ishizuka has an equity interest in Next Meats Holdings, Inc., a Nevada Company. He also currently serves
as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Director of Next Meats Holdings, Inc. Next Meats Co., Ltd. is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Next Meats Holdings, Inc. Koichi Ishizuka is also the Sole Officer, Director, and controlling shareholder of Dr. Foods,
Inc. 

Furthermore,
the company has established an informal partnership with Mama Foods Co., Ltd. This collaboration involves Mama Foods Co., Ltd. supplying
Next Meats products, which are then made available for purchase at our NEXT Restaurant ghost kitchen venue. Notably, Mama Foods Co.,

 Government
Regulations 

The
below does not extensively detail every single law and regulation to which the Company may be subject to, but rather provides an overview
of the kind of food safety standards to which our restaurant(s) will be held. 

The
main law that governs food quality and integrity in Japan is the Food Sanitation Act ("FSA") and the law that comprehensively governs
food labelling regulation is the Food Labelling Act. 

The
FSA regulates food quality and integrity by: 

-
Establishing standards and specifications for food, additives, apparatus, and food containers and packaging; 

 -
Providing for inspection to see whether the established standards are met; 

 -
Providing for hygiene management in the manufacture and sale of food; and 

 -
Requiring food businesses to be licensed. 

Under
the FSA, additives and foods containing additives must not be sold, or be produced, imported, processed, used, stored, or displayed for
marketing purposes unless the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare ("MHLW") has declared them as having no risk to human health after
seeking the views of the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council ("PAFSC"). In addition, it is not permissible to add any
processing aids, vitamins, minerals, novel foods or nutritive substances to food unless they have been expressly declared by the MHLW
as having no risk to human health. 

The
MHLW may establish specifications for methods of producing, processing, using, cooking, or preserving food or additives to be served
to the public for marketing purposes ("Specifications"), or may establish standards for food ingredients or additives to be served to
the public for marketing purposes ("Standards") pursuant to the FSA. Accordingly, where substances are allowed to be added to food, they
may only be used within the limits expressly set by the Specifications and Standards. 

In
order to operate a restaurant in Japan, we were required to obtain, and have obtained, a restaurant business license from a local health
center. The requirement to obtain this license is that we must have, and we currently do have, an employee to act as a director of food
sanitation, and a fire protection manager. Additionally, we must pay consumption tax, corporate tax, social insurance for our employees,
as well as welfare pension for our employees. We follow all related guidelines and the company directly pays all such fees in order to
remain in compliance. 

Employees 

Currently,
we, WB Burgers Asia, Inc. , have only one employee, our sole officer and director Koichi Ishizuka. Mr. Ishizuka does not
have any employment agreement with the Company, and has not entered into any formal agreement with the company pertaining to compensation.
Our wholly subsidiary, WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd. has thirty nine salaried staff members. Four employees are full time, and thirty five
employees are part time. The employees are comprised primarily of staff members who operate our restaurant location. 

During
the period ending July 31, 2023, the Company paid White Knight Co., Ltd. 917,895 for compensation expenses. White Knight Co., Ltd.
is owned and controlled by our sole officer and director, Koichi Ishizuka. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

As
a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information called for

Item
1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. 

The
Company filed a Form S-1/A with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 22, 2023. Regarding this form, the Company received
a comment letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 18, 2023, to which it has not yet responded. The Company plans
to address the outstanding comment letter within the next sixty days. 

Item
2. Properties. 

At
present, we do not own any properties. However, we do lease our restaurant location. 

Our
flagship restaurant location is currently leased from Arai Co., Ltd., a Japanese realty group, 

Details
of the Leased Property: The property is located at 6-19-20 No.15 Arai Bldg Jingumae Shibuya-Ku, Tokyo, Japan, which is in a popular shopping
location that is only a minute walk from the Omotesando Station. The deposit is 35,000,000 JPY 304,000) and the monthly rent is 3,850,000
JPY (including tax) 33,475). The term of the lease extends from November 9, 2021 to January 8, 2024, and has the option to be extended
indefinitely for additional two-year periods. The interior space is 157.82 (1698.760 square ft), and the terrace space is 145.06
 (1561.413 square ft), which accounts for a total usable space of 302.88 (3260.173 square ft).

In
August of 2022, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., entered into and consummated a rental agreement
with Kitchen Depot for a ghost kitchen in the Tamachi neighborhood of Minato, Tokyo, Japan. Following notice provided to
Kitchen Depot in September of 2023, in November of 2023, we terminated our rental agreement with Kitchen Depot and we ceased all operations
through our, now former, ghost kitchen location in Tamachi. 

Item
3. Legal Proceedings. 

From
time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our
business. The Company is not currently involved in legal proceedings that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. 

In
May of 2023, a shareholder of Next Meats Holdings, Inc. NXMH ), a company controlled by our sole officer and director,
Koichi Ishizuka, brought an action against Koichi Ishizuka and White Knight Co., Ltd., in the Southern District of New York for recovery
of alleged short swing profits earned from the sale of NXMH common stock, under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Koichi Ishizuka and White Knight Co., Ltd. are vigorously defending this matter. 

WB
Burgers Asia, Inc. has no direct exposure in connection with the lawsuit and this action should not be considered material to the Company.

Market
 Information 

Our
common stock was quoted on the over-the-counter market (the OTC Markets in the Pink Open Market (the Pink
Market under the symbol WBBA . Given our delinquent SEC Reporting status, we have recently been demoted by the OTC
Markets to the Expert Market tier under the same symbol. 

Quotations
in Expert Market securities are restricted from public viewing. We anticipate that we will resume trading on the Pink Open Market
when we are current in our SEC reporting obligations once again. Currently, we are delinquent in filing our Form 10-Q for the quarterly
period ended October 31, 2023. We intend to file this report subsequent to the filing of this Form 10-K, however we cannot state with
any level of specificity exactly when the delinquent report will be filed as we remain active in preparing the report. 

There
is currently a limited trading market in the Company s shares of common stock. Generally speaking, our shares of common stock are,
and have been thinly traded, meaning our shares cannot be easily purchased or sold and have a low volume of shares trading per day which
can lead to volatile changes in price per share.

Summary
of Business 

WB
Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., referred to herein as WBJ , which we operate through and share the same business plan of, holds
the rights to the Master Franchise Agreement with Jakes Franchising LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability
Company, as it pertains to the establishment and operation of Wayback Burger Restaurants within the country of Japan. 

Master
Franchise Agreement - Summary 

The
Master Franchise Agreement provides WBJ the right to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurants in the country of Japan, and also
license affiliated and unaffiliated third parties Franchisees to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurants in
the Country of Japan, this agreement lasts for a term of twenty years, unless it is terminated sooner in accordance with terms outlined
in the Master Franchise Agreement, and may be extended one additional, consecutive term of ten years. In exchange for such rights, we
paid Jake s Franchising 2,700,000 USD, and we must pay an additional 10,000 for each additional company operated Wayback Burgers
restaurant and for each sub-franchised location the fee is either 10,000 or 28.57 of the initial franchise fee collected for such Restaurant,
whichever is greater. Additionally, there is also a royalty fee in the amount of three percent (3 of the Gross Sales of all Company-Operated
Wayback Burgers Restaurants in the Country and the greater of two percent (2 of the Gross Sales of all Franchised Wayback Burgers Restaurants
in the Country or forty percent (40 of the royalty fees collected for all Franchised Wayback Burgers Restaurants in the Country. The
Master Franchise Agreement, amongst other things, also provides WBJ the right of first refusal to enter into a subsequent
Master Franchise Agreement with Jake s Franchising, LLC to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurants in the Countries of
Indonesia, Malaysia (Eastern Malaysia only, Western Malaysia if it becomes available as it is currently licensed to another party), the
Philippines, Vietnam, China, India, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, and Taiwan. 

Master
Franchise Agreement - Duties 

The
Master Franchise Agreement dictates specific duties we must perform which include, but are not limited to, providing Jake s Franchising
with plans and specifications for restaurant locations, provide employees with Wayback Burgers mandated training, present Jake s
Franchising with copies of all potential advertising and promotional material, etc. Furthermore, we are required to open one Wayback
Burgers restaurant by the end of the 2022 calendar year, three restaurants by the end of the 2023 calendar year, and an additional three
restaurants must open, and remain in operation, every following year until December 31, 2041, at which time we must have sixty Wayback
Burgers restaurants open and in operation. If we fail to meet these targets, then we would need to renegotiate terms with Jake s
Franchising, or we could potentially lose our master franchise rights in their entirety. As of the date of this report, the Company has
not adhered to the stipulated requirements outlined in the Master Franchise Agreement concerning the establishment of additional restaurant
locations. While the Company has received informal assurance, through verbal discussions with representatives of Jake s Franchising,
that no penalties will be imposed, there remains the potential for Jake s Franchising to exercise their discretion and terminate
the Master Franchise Agreement unless the Company achieves full compliance with all specified terms. In the event of such termination,
the Company s operational outcomes would be adversely affected, necessitating a significant alteration of our business plan, or
potentially raising questions about the feasibility of sustaining our operations. 

For
full terms and details of the Master Franchise Agreement, one can view a complete copy which has been filed as an exhibit to the Form
8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 16, 2021. 

WB
Burgers Japan Co., Ltd. seeks to make Wayback Burgers a nationally recognized brand, if not a household name, within the
country of Japan through the promotion and opening of various Wayback Burgers Restaurants. 

Locations 

On
November 9, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary, WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., consummated a lease agreement with Arai Co., Ltd., a Japanese
realty group, for the location of our first Wayback Burgers restaurant. The property is located in the popular shopping plaza of Omotesando,
located in the Tokyo prefecture. Currently, this is our central and only physical location. We
believe the high volume of foot traffic and shopping will yield a large group of patrons seeking to try our product offerings. 

In August of
2022, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., entered into and consummated a rental agreement with Kitchen
Depot for a ghost kitchen in the Tamachi neighborhood of Minato, Tokyo, Japan. Following notice provided to Kitchen Depot in September
of 2023, in November of 2023, the Company terminated its rental agreement with Kitchen Depot, as well as its operations at its ghost
kitchen in the Tamachi neighborhood of Minato, Tokyo, Japan. The Company has no plans to resume operations at this location at any juncture,
as it believes this location is unlikely to be profitable, considering the low volume of orders it received while this location was operational. 

On October 1,
2023, an agreement was established between our company and Next Meats Co., Ltd., spanning a three-year duration, concerning the licensing
of logos and related assets. Subsequently, in November 2023, the operation of a ghost kitchen named NEXT Restaurant commenced
at our flagship Omotesando location. This initiative stems from a collaboration between our company and Next Meats Holdings, Inc., particularly
its subsidiary Next Meats Co., Ltd., aimed at opening a venue offering Next Meats menu selections, including the prominently featured
 NEXT Pizza . 

The majority
of menu items available at this ghost kitchen are sourced from Mama Foods Co., Ltd., the primary manufacturer of products for Next Meats
Holdings, Inc. Consequently, 1 of the sales generated at this restaurant location are remitted to Next Meats Co., Ltd., as part of the
collaborative agreement. 

Subsidiaries 

We have two wholly
owned subsidiaries, WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., and Store Foods Co., Ltd. Both of our wholly owned subsidiaries are Japanese Companies.
Store Foods Co., Ltd. has not yet commenced any material operations and our plans for Store Foods Co., Ltd. have not yet been fully determined
with any level of specificity. 

Anticipated
Capital Requirements 

In order to fund
our operations for the next twelve months we believe we will need a minimum of at least 500,000. We believe this will cover our future
expansion and growth efforts, barring any unforeseen capital expenditures that may arise.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

As
of July 31, 2023, and 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 161,213 and 126,669, respectively. The variance in our
cash balance from July 31, 2022 to July 31, 2023 is the result of the Company having increased operations, namely our dine in and dine
out restaurant location in the Omotesando Shopping Plaza, located in Tokyo, Japan. 

Assets 

Our
total assets for July 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 were 1,259,223 and 3,760,615, respectively. The reason for the variance is primarily
attributable to the fact that the Master Franchise Agreement we entered into with Jakes Franchising LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability
Company, to operate Wayback Burgers Franchise locations, is recorded as an asset for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, but
not for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. 

The
reason why the franchise rights were not recorded as an asset for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 is because the Company has demonstrated
no track record of capitalizing on the franchise rights beyond the company owned stores which were not profitable through the current
date. 

Revenues 

For
the year ended July 31, 2023, and 2022, we generated revenues of 581,798 and 180,821 respectively. The
variance in revenue year over year is due to the fact that we increased our operations during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. However,
our cost of revenue was 1,341,572 for the year ended July 31, 2023 and 716,083 for the year ended July 31, 2022. As a result, our gross
loss for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 was 759,774 compared to a gross loss of 535,262 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022.
We do not believe that our cost of revenues will proportionally increase with our revenues, and thus, we believe generating more revenue
will h elp to alleviate our losses we have experienced for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and July
31, 2022. 

Other
Income (Loss) 

Other income
(expense) was 148,105, comprised of cash receipts of the consumption tax, for the year ended July 31, 2023, and (334,317) for the year
ended July 31, 2022. The variance year over year is primarily attributable to expensed related party loan receivables from the year ended
July 31, 2022 that was recorded as other expense . 

Net
Operating Loss 

Our
general and administrative expenses were 3,311,706 for the year ended July 31, 2023 and 733,744 for the year ended July 31, 2022. Our
net operating loss for the year ended July 31, 2023 was 4,071,480 and 1,269,006 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. The variance
is a result of the to tal general and administrative
expense for the year ended July 31, 2023, which includes a loss on impairment totaling 1,899,666. This impairment loss is related to
the Company s adjustment to the value of the franchise rights asset. 

As
mentioned above, we believe that in order to remedy our net loss we will require additional revenue. We are currently exploring a means
in which to gain more customers at our dine in location. 

Additional
 Paid-In Capital 

During
the period ended July 31, 2022, White Knight forgave a loan to the Company of approximately 2,317,272, which is recorded as additional
paid-in capital. 

The
Company s sole officer and director, Koichi Ishizuka, paid expenses on behalf of the Company totaling 55,030 during the period
ended July 31, 2022. These payments are considered contributions to the company with no expectation of repayment and are posted as additional

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

 To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of WB Burgers Asia, Inc. 

 Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

 We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WB Burgers Asia, Inc. (the Company) as of July 31, 2023, and 2022, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the two-year period
ended July 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2023, and 2022, and the results
of its consolidated operations and its cash flows for the two-year period ended July 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

 The
Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

 The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has negative financial trends, specifically operating loss,
working capital deficiency, and other adverse key financial ratios that raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. Management s evaluation of the events and conditions and management s plans in regarding these
matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty. 

 Basis
for Opinion 

 These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, audits of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Critical
Audits Matters 

 The
critical audits matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audits of the consolidated financial statements
that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audits committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audits matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole,
and we are not, by communicating the critical audits matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audits matters or on the
accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

 Going
Concern 

 As
discussed in Note 3 the Company has negative financial trends, specifically operating loss, working capital deficiency, and other adverse
key financial ratios that raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Auditing management s
evaluation of a going concern can be a significant judgment given the fact that the Company uses management estimates on future revenues
and expenses, which are difficult to substantiate. 

 We
evaluated the appropriateness of the going concern, we examined and evaluated the financial information along with management s
plans to mitigate the going concern and management s disclosure on going concern.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The
Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this annual report, is collected, recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the SEC. The Company s disclosure controls and
procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the Company s Chief Chief Executive Officer who
also serves as our Principal Financial Officer, Koichi Ishizuka, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Koichi Ishizuka, concluded that the disclosure
controls and procedures are ineffective. 

Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Koichi Ishizuka, has reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by the report July 31, 2023 and
has concluded that (i) the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that material information relating
to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission,
and (ii) the Company s controls and procedures have not been designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including
its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The
Company s management, which at this time consists solely of Koichi Ishizuka, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company s internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board of directors regarding the
preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Management conducted an assessment of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on the assessment, management concluded that,
as of July 31, 2023, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is ineffective based on those criteria. 

The
Company s management, Koichi Ishizuka, who serves as our Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud.
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of error or fraud, if any, within the
Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and
that the breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of
some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls
also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. However,
these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the
process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that our sole officer and director, Koichi Ishizuka, considered to be material weaknesses
under the standards of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of Treadway Commission were: domination of management by a single individual
without adequate compensating controls, lack of a majority of outside directors on board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight
in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control
objectives, and lack of an audit committee. 

The
Company believes that the material weaknesses are due to the Company s limited resources and early stages of development, which
have not allowed enough time for the Company to remedy any such weaknesses. 

Our
sole officer and director, Koichi Ishizuka, believes that the material weaknesses did not have an effect on our financial results. However,
management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and inadequate segregation of duties results in ineffective oversight
in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our
financial statements in future periods. 

Our
Chief Executive Officer recognizes that its controls and procedures would be substantially improved if we had an audit committee and
or two individuals serving as officers, and as such, is actively seeking to remediate this issue. 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated,
or plan to initiate, the following series of measures: 

We
intend to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical
accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us. Furthermore, we plan to appoint one or more outside
directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who
will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving
estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us. 

Management
believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy
the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board. 

We
will work as quickly as possible to implement these initiatives however, the early stages of our current development, and other business
initiatives will likely slow this implementation or divert our attention. 

Auditor s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

This
Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to

Mr.
Koichi Ishizuka, Age 53 - Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer

for Xinhua Finance Japan in 2006, Fate Corporation in 2008, and LCA Holdings, Ltd. in 2009. 

Presently,
Mr. Ishizuka holds the position of Chief Executive Officer across a spectrum of companies, including OFF

Inc. Additionally, he serves as the Chief Financial Officer of Next Meats Co., Ltd., a Japanese alternative meat company and wholly owned
subsidiary of Next Meats Holdings, Inc. 

Since
its inception on April 14, 2021, Koichi Ishizuka has served as CEO of WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., a Japanese company. On May 7, 2021,
Mr. Koichi Ishizuka was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director
of Business Solutions Plus, Inc., which is now known as WB Burgers Asia, Inc. WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd. is a wholly owned subsidiary
of WB Burgers Asia, Inc. WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd. holds the rights to the Master Franchise Agreement 
with Jakes Franchising LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company, as it pertains to the establishment and operation of Wayback

Officer, President, Treasurer, and Director of Dr. Foods, Inc. (formerly known as Catapult Solutions, Inc.). Koichi Ishizuka has a controlling
interest in Dr. Foods, Inc. On March 21, 2022, Mr. Ishizuka was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President,
Secretary, Treasurer, and Director of WeCapital Holdings, Inc., (formerly known as Perfect Solutions Group, Inc.). 

Given
Mr. Ishizuka s extensive business acumen and long standing entrepreneurial background, the company firmly believes that Koichi
Ishizuka is well-suited to continue to serve as our sole officer and director. 

As
of the date of this filing, there has been no material plan, contract, or arrangement (whether or not written) to which our sole officer
and director, Koichi Ishizuka, is a party in connection with his appointments at WB Burgers Asia, Inc. 

Employees 

As
of December 29, 2023, we, WB Burgers Asia, Inc., have no employees outside of our sole officer and director, Koichi Ishizuka. We
do not have an employment or consulting agreement with Mr. Ishizuka. Mr. Ishizuka has not received any monetary compensation by the Company
and or its subsidiaries through our most recent fiscal year end July 31, 2023. 

Our
wholly subsidiary, WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd. has thirty nine salaried staff members. Four employees are full time, and thirty five employees
are part time. The employees are comprised primarily of staff members who operate our restaurant location. 

Director s
Term of Office 

Our
current director holds office until the next annual meeting of our stockholders or until his successor has been elected and qualified,
or until his death, resignation, or removal. Our executive officers are appointed by our Board and hold office until their death, resignation,
or removal from office. 

Corporate
Governance 

The
Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and in
other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations.
The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company s employees, officers
and directors as the Company is not required to do so. 

In
lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company s Board of Directors, consisting solely of Koichi Ishizuka, is responsible for reviewing
and making recommendations concerning the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual
audit of the Company's financial statements and other services provided by the Company s independent public accountants. Our sole
officer and director reviews the Company's internal accounting controls, practices, and policies. 

Committees
of the Board 

Our
Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our
Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Currently, our sole officer and director, Koichi Ishizuka,
is performing the functions of such committees. 

Audit
Committee Financial Expert 

Our
Board has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined
in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term is used in
Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14) of the
FINRA Rules. 

We
believe that our sole director, Koichi Ishizuka, is currently capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding
internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

Our
sole officer and director has not been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years: 

1. 
 bankruptcy
 petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the
 bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 
 
 2. 
 any conviction in a criminal
 proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); 
 
 3. 
 being subject to any order,
 judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily
 enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his/her involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities;
 or 
 
 4. 
 being found by a court
 of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal
 or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. 
 
 5. 
 Such person was found by
 a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State securities law, and
 the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated; 
 
 6. 
 Such person was found by
 a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated any Federal commodities
 law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not been subsequently reversed,
 suspended or vacated; 
 
 7. 
 Such person was the subject
 of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed,
 suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of:(i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities law or regulation; or(ii)
 Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent
 injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal
 or prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity;
 or 
 
 8. 
 Such person was the subject
 of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as
 defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of
 the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary
 authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 

Independence
of Directors 

We
are not required to have independent members of our Board of Directors, and currently we do not have any independent Directors. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and
determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal,
business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand
in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Shareholder
Proposals 

Our
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors.
The Board of Directors, which presently consists solely of Koichi Ishizuka, believes that, given the stage of our development, and our
limited resources, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to
a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board
of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all
candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment. 

A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our Chief Executive
Officer, Koichi Ishizuka, at the address appearing on the first page of this Annual Report.

 White Knight Co., Ltd., is owned entirely by our sole officer and director, Koichi
 Ishizuka. 

Beneficial
ownership has been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to
be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares).
In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon
exercise of an option or warrant) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership
of any person, the amount of shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person by reason of such acquisition
rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following table does not necessarily reflect
the person s actual voting power at any particular date.

The

ended July 31, 2022. These payments are considered contributions to the company with no expectation of repayment and are posted as additional

Purchase
of wholly owned subsidiary 

On September
14, 2021, we entered into an Acquisition Agreement with related party White Knight Co., Ltd., a Japan Company, whereas
we issued 500,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to White Knight Co., Ltd., in exchange for 100 of the equity interests of WB
Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., a Japan Company. Pursuant to the agreement, on October 1, 2021, White Knight Co., Ltd. has agreed to, and has
subsequently forgiven any outstanding loans with WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd. as of October 1, 2021. Following this transaction, WB Burgers

In
 regards to the above transaction, the Company claims an exemption from registration afforded
 by Section Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Regulation S") for the
 above sales/issuances of the stock since the sales/issuances of the stock were made to non-U.S.
 persons (as defined under Rule 902 section (k)(2)(i) of Regulation S), pursuant to offshore
 transactions, and no directed selling efforts were made in the United States by the issuer,

During

from the sale of Next Meats products. As of July 31, 2023, the royalty liability owed to Next Meats was approximately 37. Next
Restaurant shares the same kitchen space as the Company s Omotesando location situated at 6-19-20 No.15 Arai Bldg Jingumae Shibuya-Ku,
Tokyo, Japan. This location serves as the Company s flagship and sole physical dine-in location. Products from Next Restaurant
can be enjoyed either within the premises or taken out, as the ghost kitchen operates in conjunction with the Company s flagship

Holdings, Inc., he is deemed to be the controlling shareholder of Next Meats Holdings, Inc.

On a moving forward basis, our sole officer and director, Koichi Ishizuka, will continue to approve any related party transaction.
