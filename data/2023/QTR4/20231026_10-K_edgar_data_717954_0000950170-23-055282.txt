Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

 ITEM 1. B USINESS 
 GENERAL 
 UniFirst Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1950, together with its subsidiaries, hereunder referred to as we , our , the Company , or UniFirst , is one of the leading providers of workplace uniforms and protective work wear clothing in the United States U.S. ). We design, manufacture, personalize, rent, clean, deliver, and sell a wide range of uniforms and protective clothing, including shirts, pants, jackets, coveralls, lab coats, smocks, aprons and specialized protective wear, such as flame resistant and high visibility garments. We also rent and sell industrial wiping products, floor mats, facility service products and other non-garment items, and provide restroom and cleaning supplies and first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies as well as certain safety training to a variety of manufacturers, retailers and service companies. We serve businesses of all sizes in numerous industry categories. At certain specialized facilities, we also decontaminate and clean work clothes and other items that may have been exposed to radioactive materials, and service special cleanroom protective wear and facilities. 
 Our principal services include providing customers with uniforms and other non-garment items, picking up soiled uniforms or other items on a periodic basis (usually weekly), and delivering, at the same time, cleaned and processed items. We offer uniforms in a wide variety of styles, colors, sizes and fabrics, often with personalized emblems selected by the customer. Our centralized services, specialized equipment and economies of scale generally allow us to be more cost effective in providing garment services than customers could be themselves, particularly those customers with high employee turnover rates. During the fiscal year ended August 26, 2023 fiscal 2023 ), we manufactured approximately 60 of the garments we placed in service. These were primarily work pants and shirts manufactured at three of our plants located in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, one plant located in Managua, Nicaragua, as well as at subcontract manufacturers that we utilize within our sourcing strategy to balance demand and optimize costs. Because we design and manufacture a majority of our own uniforms and protective clothes, we can produce custom garment programs for our larger customers, offer a diverse range of such designs within our standard line of garments and better control the quality, price and speed at which we service such garments. 
 PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
 We provide our customers with personalized workplace uniforms and protective work clothing in a broad range of styles, colors, sizes and fabrics. Our uniform products include shirts, pants, jackets, coveralls, lab coats, smocks, aprons and specialized protective wear, such as flame resistant and high visibility garments. At certain specialized facilities, we also decontaminate and clean clothes and other items which may have been exposed to radioactive materials and service special cleanroom protective wear and facilities. We also offer non-garment items and services, such as industrial wiping products, floor mats, dry and wet mops, restroom and cleaning supplies and other textile products. We also sell first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies, provide certain safety training and maintain wholesale distribution and pill packaging operations. 
 We offer our customers a range of garment service options, including full-service rental programs in which garments are cleaned and serviced by us, lease programs in which garments are cleaned and maintained by individual employees and purchase programs to buy garments and related items directly. As part of our rental business, we pick up a customer s soiled uniforms and/or other items on a periodic basis (usually weekly) and deliver back cleaned and processed replacement items. We believe our centralized services, specialized equipment and economies of scale generally allow us to be more cost effective in providing garment and related services than customers could be themselves, particularly those customers with high employee turnover rates. Our uniform program is intended not only to help our customers foster a company identity, but also to enhance their corporate image and improve employee safety, productivity and morale. We primarily serve our customers pursuant to written service contracts that range in duration from three to five years.

Historically, our revenues and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations have been due to a number of factors, including: general economic conditions in our markets; the timing of acquisitions and of commencing start-up operations and related costs; our effectiveness in integrating acquired businesses and start-up operations; the timing of nuclear plant outages; volatility in raw material and labor costs; capital expenditures; seasonal rental and purchasing patterns of our customers; and price changes in response to competitive factors. In addition, our operating results historically have been lower during the second and fourth fiscal quarters than during the other quarters of the fiscal year. The operating results for any historical quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for an entire fiscal year or any other interim periods. 
 CUSTOMERS 
 We serve businesses of all sizes in most industry categories. During each of the past three years, no single customer in our Core Laundry Operations segment accounted for more than 10 of our revenues. Our typical customers include automobile service centers and dealers, delivery services, food and general merchandise retailers, manufacturers, maintenance facilities, restaurants and food-related businesses, healthcare providers including vaccine manufacturers, business service providers, soft and durable goods wholesalers, transportation and warehousing companies, energy production and transmission operations, and many others who require employee clothing on the job for image, identification, protection and/or utility purposes. Among the largest customers of our conventional uniform rental business are divisions, units, regional operations or franchised agencies of major, nationally recognized organizations. With respect to our Specialty Garments segment, typical customers include government agencies, research and development laboratories, high technology companies, cleanroom operators, and utilities operating nuclear reactors. We currently service over 300,000 customer locations in the U.S., Canada and Europe from more than 270 customer service, distribution and manufacturing facilities. 
 MARKETING, SALES, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE 
 We market our products and services to a diverse customer base and to prospects that range across virtually all industry segments. Marketing contact is made through print advertising, direct mail, digital advertising, publicity, trade shows, catalogs, telemarketing, multiple web sites and direct field sales representation. We have built and maintain an extensive, proprietary database of prescreened and qualified business prospects that have been sourced from our various promotional initiatives, including mailers, web site contacts, advertising responses, sales calls and lists purchased from third-party providers. These prospect records serve as a primary targeting resource for our professional sales organization and are constantly updated, expanded and maintained by an in-house team of specialist database qualifiers and managers. To aid in the effective marketing of products and services, we supply sales representatives with an extensive selection of sales aids, brochures, presentation materials and vertical market communications tools. We also provide representatives with detailed on-line profiles of high opportunity markets to educate them on the typical issues, needs and concerns of those markets. This helps establish credibility and aids their ability to deliver value-based solutions. 
 We employ a large team of trained professional sales representatives to market our services to potential customers and develop new accounts. While most of our sales representatives present a full range of service solutions, we also have dedicated representatives for select products and services as well as for specific markets. For example, in certain geographic markets we employ teams of dedicated facility services sales representatives who focus exclusively on developing business for our floor care, restroom and related service programs. We employ specialist executive-level salespeople in our National Accounts organization with specialists in rental programs and in direct sale programs to target the very largest national companies with broad uniform and/or facility services program needs. 
 We believe that effective customer service is the most crucial element in developing and maintaining our market position. Our commitment to service excellence is reflected throughout our organization. Our route sales representatives are the first line of continuing customer contact. They are supported by local customer service representatives, local service management staff, and local operations management leaders, all of whom are focused on addressing the ongoing needs of customers, constantly delivering high-value service and pursuing total customer satisfaction. Our proprietary information systems and our support service center enable us to respond to customer inquiries or issues within 24 hours, and our service personnel are specially trained to handle the daily contact work necessary to effectively manage customer relations. We measure the speed and accuracy of our customer service efforts weekly and continuously survey, record and report satisfaction levels to evaluate current performance and highlight areas for improvement.

COMPETITION 
 The uniform rental and sales industry is highly competitive. The principal methods of competition in the industry are the quality of products, the quality of service and pricing. Our principal competitors include Cintas Corporation, Alsco and Vestis Corporation (formerly Aramark Uniform Services). The remainder of the market is divided among several hundred smaller businesses, mostly serving a single or a limited number of geographic service areas. In addition to our traditional rental competitors, we may increasingly compete in the future with businesses that focus on selling uniforms, facilities services products and other related items. 
 MANUFACTURING AND SOURCING 
 We manufactured approximately 60 of all garments we placed in service during fiscal 2023. These garments were primarily work pants and shirts manufactured at three of our plants located in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, one plant located in Managua, Nicaragua, as well as at subcontracted manufacturers that we utilize within our sourcing strategy to balance demand and optimize costs. The balance of the garments used in our programs are purchased from a variety of industry suppliers. While we currently acquire the raw materials with which we produce our garments from a limited number of suppliers, we believe that such materials are generally readily available from other sources. To date, we have experienced limited difficulty in obtaining any of our raw materials or supplies although at certain times, we have sourced raw materials or supplies from alternative sources or experienced costs increases for such raw materials and supplies. Currently, we also manufacture approximately 99 of the mats we place in service at our plant in Cave City, Arkansas. 
 HUMAN CAPITAL 
 As of August 26, 2023, we employed approximately 16,000 persons, and less than 1 of our U.S. employees are represented by a union pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good. 
 Our success depends on our employee team partners. As a result, we strive to recruit, develop and retain talented team partners. We provide training to our team partners along with opportunities to advance. For example, our leadership development program provides leadership education, operational knowledge and hands-on business experience within the industrial laundry and facilities services industry and is designed to develop our future managers. 
 We also seek to promote a family culture and believe that our workforce is critical to our success and to the service of our customers. 
 In addition, we focus on the safety and well-being of our team partners. We provide safety training and personal protective equipment. We also provide our team partners with competitive healthcare, wellness and other benefits.

 GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
 We, like our competitors, are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other substances. In particular, industrial laundries currently use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues, and, in the past, used perchloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents. We are attentive to the environmental concerns surrounding the disposal of these materials and have, through the years taken measures to avoid their improper disposal. We have settled, or contributed to the settlement of, past actions or claims brought against us relating to the disposal of hazardous materials at several sites and there can be no assurance that we will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future. Further, under environmental laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on, or in, or emanating from such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of, or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. There can be no assurance that acquired or leased locations have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon us under such laws or expose us to third-party actions such as tort suits. We continue to address environmental conditions under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise with respect to certain sites. We routinely review and evaluate sites that may require remediation and monitoring and determine our estimated costs based on various estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of our accruals with respect to environmental liabilities and additional discussion regarding environmental matters, refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer also to the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding environmental matters.

Our nuclear garment decontamination facilities in the U.S. are licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or in certain cases, by the applicable state agency, and are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. We also have nuclear garment decontamination facilities in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. These facilities are licensed and regulated by the respective country s applicable federal agency. In the past, scrutiny and regulation of nuclear facilities and related services have resulted in the suspension of operations at certain nuclear facilities served by us or disruptions in our ability to service such facilities. There can be no assurance that such scrutiny and regulation will not lead to the shut-down of such facilities or otherwise cause material disruptions in our garment decontamination business.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS 
 We face intense competition within our industry, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 The rental and sales industry with respect to uniforms, workwear and facility services is highly competitive. The principal methods of competition in the industry are quality of products, quality of service and price. Our leading competitors include Cintas Corporation, Alsco and Vestis Corporation (formerly Aramark Uniform Services). The remainder of the market, however, is divided among more than 600 smaller businesses, many of which serve one or a limited number of markets or geographic service areas. In addition to our traditional rental competitors, we may increasingly compete in the future with businesses that focus on selling uniforms and other related items, including single-use disposable garments for use in the nuclear industry. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We also compete with industry competitors for acquisitions, which has the effect of increasing the price for acquisitions and reducing the number of acquisition candidates available to us. If we pay higher prices for businesses we acquire, our returns on investment and profitability may be reduced. 
 Adverse economic and business conditions or geopolitical events may affect our business and our customer base and have a material adverse impact on our sales and operating results. 
 We supply uniform, workwear and facility services to many industries that have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to adverse economic and business conditions resulting in shifting employment levels, workforce reductions, changes in worker productivity, uncertainty regarding the impacts of rehiring and shifts to offshore manufacturing. In addition, geopolitical conflicts, calamities or other events, including the conflict between Russian and Ukraine, disruption in the Middle East and public health events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may disrupt domestic and global business and financial markets and conditions. 
 In recent quarters, we have observed increased economic uncertainty in the U.S. and abroad, including the potential for an economic recession. Impacts of such general economic weakness include, without limitation: falling overall demand for goods and services; reduced credit availability; reduced liquidity; volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets; bankruptcies and rising interest rates. 
 Adverse economic conditions have included or resulted, and could continue to include or result, in a significant increase in inflation, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, including our operating margins. Continued high inflation has had a negative impact on our operating margins in recent periods. Any conditions or events that adversely affect our current customers or sales prospects may cause such customers or prospects to restrict expenditures, reduce workforces or even to cease to conduct their businesses. Any of these circumstances would have the effect of reducing the number of employees utilizing our uniform, workwear and facility services, which could have a material adverse impact on our sales and results of operations. 
 Continued high inflation rates, or further increases in inflation rates, could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and operating margins. In addition, if our costs increase and we are not able to pass along these price increases to our customers, our results of operations would be adversely affected, and the adverse impact may be material. 
 Higher inflation rates have had an adverse impact on our operating margins. Although inflation rates have moderated somewhat recently, continued high inflation or future increases in inflation may result in decreased demand for our products and services, increased operating costs, including our labor costs, reduced liquidity, and limitations on our ability to access credit or otherwise raise debt and equity capital. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised, and may continue to raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation. Continued high interest rates or increases in interest rates, especially if coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks, which may result in economic recession. In an inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the prices of our products and services at or above the rate at which our costs increase, which may reduce our operating margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We also may experience lower than expected sales and potential adverse impacts on our competitive position if there is a decrease in customer spending or a 
 7 

negative reaction to our pricing. A reduction in our revenue would be detrimental to our profitability and financial condition and could also have an adverse impact on our future growth. 
 Our failure to implement successfully our acquisition strategy and to grow our business could adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues and could negatively impact our profitability. 
 As part of our growth strategy, we intend to continue to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities. However, as discussed above, we compete with others within our industry for suitable acquisition candidates. This competition may increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of acquisition candidates available to us. As a result, our ability to acquire businesses in the future, and to acquire such businesses on favorable terms, may be limited. Even if we are able to acquire businesses on favorable terms, managing growth through acquisition is a difficult process that includes integration and training of personnel, combining plant and operating procedures and additional matters related to the integration of acquired businesses within our existing organization. Unanticipated issues related to integration may result in additional expense or in disruption to our operations, either of which could negatively impact our ability to achieve anticipated benefits. While we believe we will be able to fully integrate acquired businesses, such as Clean, we can give no assurance that we will be successful in this regard. 
 Growth of our business will likely require us to increase our work force, the scope of our operating and financial systems and the geographic area of our operations. We believe this growth will increase our operating complexity and the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel. Managing and sustaining our growth and expansion may require substantial enhancements to our operational and financial systems and controls, as well as additional administrative, operational and financial resources. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expanding operations successfully, that any acquired business, including Clean, will perform as we expect, or that we will be able to maintain or accelerate our growth, and any failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 In order to finance such acquisitions, we may need to obtain additional funds either through public or private financings, including bank and other secured and unsecured borrowings and the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that such financings would be available to us on reasonable terms or that any future issuances of securities in connection with acquisitions will not be dilutive to our shareholders. 
 If we are unable to preserve positive labor relationships or become the target of corporate labor unionization campaigns, the resulting labor unrest could disrupt our business by impairing our ability to produce and deliver our products. 
 As of August 26, 2023, we employ approximately 16,000 persons and less than 1 of our U.S. employees are represented by a union pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. Competitors within our industry have been the target of corporate unionization campaigns by multiple labor unions. While our management believes that our employee relations are good, we cannot assure you that we will not become the target of campaigns similar to those faced by our competitors. The potential for unionization could increase if the U.S. Congress passes federal card check legislation in the future. If we do encounter pressure from any labor unions in connection with our acquisitions of other businesses, any resulting labor unrest could disrupt our business by impairing our ability to produce and deliver our products. In addition, significant union representation would require us to negotiate wages, salaries, benefits and other terms with many of our employees collectively and could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our labor costs or otherwise restricting our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations. 
 We may incur unexpected cost increases due to rising healthcare costs, the Affordable Care Act and other labor costs. 
 In general, the cost of healthcare that we provide to our employees has grown over the last few years at a rate in excess of our revenue growth and, as a result, has negatively impacted our operating results. Moreover, it is generally expected that healthcare costs in the U.S. will increase over the coming years. In addition, we may incur significant healthcare costs if a significant number of our employees experience injury or illness, including in connection with public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of these factors, and depending on the effect of any modifications we have made and may make in the future to our employee healthcare plans and enrollment levels in those plans, including as a result of the Affordable Care Act or any future legislation or regulation affecting the healthcare industry, we expect that our future operating results will continue to be further adversely impacted by increasing healthcare costs. 
 Federal, state and municipal governments have and may continue to mandate increases to minimum wage and other employee benefits. In addition, we face wage pressure as the result of a low unemployment environment and increased competition in hiring. We have raised, and expect to continue to raise, our wage rates and benefits to reflect these changes, which has the effect of increasing our labor costs, which in turn adversely affects our results of operation and financial

condition. Our failure to comply with these regulatory requirements would expose us to applicable penalties and increase the likelihood that we would be subject to unionization campaigns. Further mandates would require additional increases to our labor costs and adversely affect our operating margins. 
 Our failure to retain our current customers, renew our existing customer contracts and enter into customer contracts with new customers could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our success depends on our ability to retain our current customers, renew our existing customer contracts and obtain new customers. Our ability to do so generally depends on a variety of factors, including the quality, price and responsiveness of our services, as well as our ability to market these services effectively and to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. In addition, renewal rates and our ability to obtain new customers are generally adversely affected by difficult economic and business conditions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new customers, renew existing customer contracts at the same or higher rates or that our current customers will not turn to competitors, cease operations or terminate contracts with us. Our failure to renew a significant number of our existing contracts would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, and failure to obtain new customers could have an adverse effect on our growth and results of operations. 
 Periods of high fuel and energy costs and increases in fuel and energy costs could materially adversely affect our operating costs. 
 The price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, such as the potential for a broadening Middle East conflict, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting governmental sanctions against certain Russian individuals and entities, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns, limits on refining capacities, natural disasters, environmental concerns, including the impact of legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and public health emergencies. Our operating margins have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by the recent volatility in energy prices. Periods of high fuel and energy costs and any increases in fuel and energy costs could materially adversely affect our operating costs. 
 As a result of our significant presence in energy producing regions, a prolonged drop in energy prices could negatively impact our financial results. 
 We have a substantial number of plants and conduct a significant portion of our business in energy producing regions in the U.S. and Canada. In general, we are relatively more dependent on business in these regions than are many of our competitors. If a dramatic decrease in oil prices were to occur, it could impact our customers in the oil industry and cause those customers to curtail their level of operations, which could have a corresponding effect on our customers in businesses which service or supply the oil industry as well as our customers in unrelated businesses. As a result, our organic growth in periods following a dramatic decrease in oil prices could be negatively impacted by elevated headcount reductions in our wearer base as well as increased lost accounts. At times, volatility in energy prices has had and may in the future have a significant impact on wearer levels at existing customers in our North American energy-dependent markets. 
 Fluctuations in the nuclear portion of our Specialty Garments segment, including the loss of key customers or a significant reduction in our business derived from key customers, could disproportionately impact our revenue and net income and create volatility in the price of our Common Stock. 
 Our nuclear decontamination business is affected by shut-downs, outages and clean-ups of the nuclear facilities we service. We are not able to control or predict with certainty when such shut-downs, outages and clean-ups will occur. In addition, our nuclear decontamination business tends to generate more revenue in the first and third fiscal quarters, which is when nuclear power plants typically schedule their plant outages and refuelings and thereby increase nuclear garment utilization. Moreover, a significant percentage of this segment s revenues are generated from a limited number of nuclear power plant operator customers. This concentration subjects this business to significant risks and may result in greater volatility in this segment s results of operations. Fluctuations in our nuclear decontamination business, including the loss of key customers of our Specialty Garments business, or a significant reduction in our business derived from such key customers, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our international business results are influenced by currency fluctuations and other risks that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 A portion of our sales is derived from international markets. Revenue denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar represented approximately 7.0 , 7.9 and 8.4 of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2023, the fiscal year ended August 27, 2022 fiscal 2022 and the fiscal year ended August 28, 2021 fiscal 2021 ), respectively. The operating results of our international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars and such results are affected by movements in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The strength of the U.S. dollar has generally increased recently as compared to other currencies, which has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our operating results as reported in U.S. dollars. In addition, a weaker Canadian dollar increases the costs to our Canadian operations of merchandise and other operational inputs that are sourced from outside Canada, which has the effect of reducing the operating margins of our Canadian business if we are unable to recover these additional costs through price adjustments with our Canadian customers. Our international operations are also subject to other risks, including the requirement to comply with changing and conflicting national and local regulatory requirements, including, without limitation, with respect to sustainability matters; potential difficulties in staffing and labor disputes; managing and obtaining support and distribution for local operations; credit risk or financial condition of local customers; potential imposition of restrictions on investments; potentially adverse tax consequences, including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; foreign exchange controls; and local political and social conditions. In addition, U.S. and foreign trade policies and tariffs and other impositions on imported goods may have a negative impact on our business. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Mexican federal tax authority issued a tax assessment on our subsidiary in Mexico for fiscal 2016 import taxes, value added taxes and custom processing fees of over 17.0 million, plus surcharges, fines and penalties of over 67.7 million for a total assessment of over 84.7 million, which accrues interest and other charges. We disagree with such tax assessment and are challenging the validity of the tax assessment through an appeal process. There can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not have an adverse effect on our international operations or on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, we own and operate manufacturing facilities in Mexico. Violence, crime and instability in Mexico has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our operations, including the hijacking of our trucks and the implementation of security measures to protect our employees. We are not insured against such criminal attacks and there can be no assurance that losses that could result from an attack on our trucks or our personnel would not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Operations in developing nations present several additional risks, including greater fluctuation in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, economic and governmental instability, civil disturbances, volatility in gross domestic production, Foreign Corrupt Practice Act and other legal compliance issues and nationalization and expropriation of private assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our failure to properly and efficiently design, construct, implement and operate a new enterprise resource planning ERP system and to successfully complete the implementation of our customer relationship management CRM computer system could materially disrupt our operations, adversely impact the servicing of our customers and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. 
 In fiscal 2022, we initiated a multiyear ERP project with a strong focus on supply chain and procurement automation and technology. We believe that this initiative will become the core of the UniFirst technology footprint and will integrate and complement the capabilities of the CRM system that we are currently deploying. We expect this system and the supply chain and procurement capabilities that it will provide will enable lower operating costs and customer churn through enhanced inventory utilization and vendor management, improved response times to customer orders and more efficient back-end processes. We believe these capabilities will allow us to more effectively respond to and mitigate the types of supply chain challenges we experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to experience primarily as a result of the current inflationary environment. The failure to properly, efficiently and economically design, implement and operate an ERP system on a timely basis or at all could materially disrupt our operations, including our supply chain, adversely impact the servicing of our customers and have a material adverse effect on our financial results. 
 In addition, we began deployment of our new CRM project during fiscal 2021. While the deployment of the CRM system is substantially complete in the U.S., we continue to work on the implementation and operation of the system. This new system is intended to improve functionality, capability and information flow as well as increase automation in servicing our customers. The failure to successfully complete the implementation and operate the CRM system on a timely basis or at all could materially disrupt our operations, adversely impact the servicing of our customers and have a material adverse effect on our financial results. 
 10 

If our information technology systems suffer interruptions or failures, including as a result of cyber-attacks, our business operations could be disrupted or other material adverse impacts on our business could result. 
 Our information technology systems serve an important role in the efficient operation of our business. The failure of these information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, our information technology systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, ransomware, computer viruses or cyber-based attacks. Further, state-sponsored cyber-attacks could expand including as part of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which could adversely affect our or our suppliers ability to maintain and enhance key cyber security and data protection measures. While we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, if such events were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations and service our customers, and we may be required to make a significant investment to fix or replace our information technology systems, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, if customer, employee or our proprietary information is compromised by a security breach or cyber-attack or other event, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, including as a result of remedial actions that we may be required to take, potential liabilities and penalties, loss of business and reputational damage. Our failure to properly respond to any such event could also result in exposure to liability. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally designed to protect the information of clients, customers, employees, and other third parties that we collect and maintain. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number. If we fail to comply with such laws or regulations, we may be subject to litigation, monetary damages, enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions, which could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 We also rely on systems and applications provided by third-party vendors for certain information technology services. If these third-party vendors, or our suppliers or other vendors, experience service interruptions, security breaches, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, ransomware or other similar events, customer, employee or other proprietary information could be compromised and it could as a result or otherwise, have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Our business may be subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations. 
 Historically, our revenues and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. In addition, our operating results historically have been seasonally lower during the second and fourth fiscal quarters than during the other quarters of the fiscal year. We incur various costs in integrating or establishing newly acquired businesses or start-up operations, and the profitability of a new location is generally expected to be lower in the initial period of its operation than in subsequent periods. Start-up operations in particular lack the support of an existing customer base and require a significantly longer period to develop sales opportunities and meet targeted operating results. 
 These factors, among others, may cause our results of operations in some future quarters to be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock. 
 Loss of our key management or other personnel and our inability to hire qualified personnel could adversely impact our business. 
 Our success is largely dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, and certain other key personnel. If, for any reason, one or more senior executives or key personnel were not to remain active in our Company, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Our future success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees. There is competition in the market for the services of such qualified personnel and hourly workers. In addition, as discussed above, we face wage pressure as the result of a low unemployment environment and increased competition in hiring. We have raised, and expect to continue to raise, our wage rates and benefits to reflect these changes, which has the effect of increasing our labor costs, which in turn adversely affects our results of operation and financial condition. Our failure to attract and retain such personnel or workers could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We depend on third parties to supply us with raw materials and facility services products and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate raw materials in a timely and economic manner, or at all, or if our supply chain is otherwise disrupted. 
 We manufactured approximately 60 of all garments we placed in service during fiscal 2023. These were primarily work pants and shirts manufactured at three of our plants located in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, one plant located in Managua, 
 11 

Nicaragua, as well as at subcontracted manufacturers that we utilize within our sourcing strategy to balance demand and optimize costs. The balance of the garments used in our programs are purchased from a variety of industry suppliers. While we currently acquire the raw materials with which we produce our garments from a limited number of suppliers, we believe that such materials are generally readily available from other sources. Furthermore, overseas garment contractors could be subject to supply chain disruptions. We also import various facility services products, such as towels, microfiber, conventional mops, aprons, disposable gloves, etc., and our ability to obtain these supplies could potentially be impacted by supply chain disruptions. To date, we have experienced no significant difficulty in obtaining any of our raw materials or supplies, although at certain times, we have sourced raw materials or supplies from alternative sources or experienced cost increases for such raw materials and supplies. However, if we were to experience difficulty obtaining any of our raw materials from such suppliers and were unable to obtain new materials or supplies from other industry suppliers, or if the cost of obtaining such materials or supplies were to increase, including in any case as a result of continued or increasing inflation, high or rising interest rates, the COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine or other supply chain disruptions, it could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results. 
 Unexpected events, including, without limitation, fires at facilities, natural disasters as a result of climate change or otherwise, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and tornadoes, public health emergencies, war or terrorist activities, including the conflicts in the Middle East or between Russia and Ukraine, unplanned utility outages, pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, supply disruptions, failure of equipment or information systems, temporary or long-term disruption of our computer systems, or changes in laws and/or regulations impacting our business, could adversely affect our operating results. These events could result in disruption of customer service, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems. In addition, the destruction or temporary loss of, or other disruptions with respect to, our distribution facility in Owensboro, Kentucky or our manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Nicaragua would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. 
 We are controlled by our principal shareholders, and our other shareholders may be unable to affect the outcome of shareholder voting. 
 As of October 20, 2023, to the Company s knowledge, the members of the Croatti family and other family members owned, directly or indirectly, in the aggregate approximately 3,590,295 shares of our Class B Common Stock, which represents approximately 19.2 of the aggregate number of outstanding shares of our Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, but approximately 70.4 of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. To the Company s knowledge, the members of the Croatti family and other family members owned, directly or indirectly, a number of shares of Common Stock. As a result, the members of the Croatti family, acting with other family members, could effectively control most matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of a majority of the directors. While historically the members of the Croatti family have individually voted their respective shares of Class B Common Stock in the same manner, there is no contractual understanding requiring this and there is no assurance that the family members will continue to individually vote their shares of Class B Common Stock in the same manner. This voting control by the members of the Croatti family, together with certain provisions of our by-laws and articles of organization, could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company that would otherwise be beneficial to our public shareholders. 
 We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to certain information technology general controls (ITGCs) supporting the manage change and manage access processes. If not remediated appropriately and timely, such material weakness could adversely impact our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, result in loss of investor confidence and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. 
 Internal control related to the operation of technology systems is critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022, we previously identified a material weakness related to our revenue and accounts receivable process caused principally by ineffective ITGCs in the area of user access over the CRM system that we are in the process of deploying. While we worked during fiscal 2023 to remediate the previously identified material weakness, we were unable to fully remediate the material weakness prior to the end of fiscal 2023. 
 12 

As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023, management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to certain ITGCs supporting the manage change and manage access processes that were not designed and operating effectively as of the date of management s assessment. As a result, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of August 26, 2023. The material weakness relates to our CRM system that we are in the process of deploying and affects revenue and receivables as well as a group of legacy applications which affect revenue and receivables, supply inventory and merchandise in service. Our business process controls within the revenue and accounts receivable process and inventory and merchandise in service process, both automated and manual, that are dependent on the completeness and accuracy of the information derived from the affected IT systems were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. Although we are working on remedial measures, there can be no assurance that such remedial measures will be successful and we will be able to remediate the material weakness in a timely manner. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness appropriately and timely, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. 
 Our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting, including as a result of the material weakness identified by management and discussed above. 
 The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, including new and revised financial and information technology-related controls that we have been designing, implementing and operating in connection with the deployment of our new CRM system, may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, including the material weakness identified by management and discussed above and any additional material weakness which may occur in the future, could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
 LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS 
 The expenses we may incur to comply with environmental regulations, including costs associated with potential environmental remediation, may prove to be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We, like our competitors, are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other substances. In particular, industrial laundries currently use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues, and, in the past, used perchloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents. We are attentive to the environmental concerns surrounding the disposal of these materials and have, through the years, taken measures to avoid their improper disposal. Over the years, we have settled, or contributed to the settlement of, past actions or claims brought against us relating to the disposal of hazardous materials at several sites, and there can be no assurance that we will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future. Further, under environmental laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on, or in, or emanating from such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. There can be no assurance that acquired or leased locations have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon us under such laws or expose us to third-party actions such as tort suits. 
 We continue to address environmental conditions under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise with respect to sites located in or related to certain sites. 
 We have accrued certain costs related to certain sites, including but not limited to, sites in Woburn and Somerville, Massachusetts, as it has been determined that the costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We, together with 
 13 

multiple other companies, are party to a consent decree related to our property and parcels of land (the Central Area at a site in Woburn, Massachusetts. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA has provided us and other signatories to the consent decree with comments on the design and implementation of groundwater and soil remedies at the Woburn site and investigation of environmental conditions in the Central Area. The consent decree does not address any remediation work that may be required in the Central Area. We, and other signatories, have implemented and proposed to do additional work at the Woburn site but many of the EPA s comments remain to be resolved. We have accrued costs to perform certain work responsive to the EPA s comments. Additionally, we have implemented mitigation measures and continue to monitor environmental conditions at a site in Somerville, Massachusetts. We have agreed to undertake additional actions responsive to a notice of audit findings from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection concerning a regulatory submittal that we made in 2009 for a portion of the site. We have received demands from the local transit authority for reimbursement of certain costs associated with its construction of a new municipal transit station in the area of the Somerville site. This station is part of an ongoing extension of the transit system. We have reserved for costs in connection with this matter; however, in light of the uncertainties associated with this matter, these costs and the related reserve may change. 
 On a quarterly basis, we assess each of our environmental sites to determine whether the costs of investigation and remediation of environmental conditions are probable and can be reasonably estimated as well as the adequacy of our accruals with respect to such costs. There can be no assurance that our accruals with respect to our environmental sites will be sufficient or that the costs of remediation and investigation will not substantially exceed our accruals as new facts, circumstances or estimates arise. 
 Our nuclear garment decontamination facilities are licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or in certain cases, by the applicable state agency, and are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. We also have nuclear garment decontamination facilities in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. These facilities are licensed and regulated by the respective country s applicable federal agency. In the past, scrutiny and regulation of nuclear facilities and related services have resulted in the suspension of operations at certain nuclear facilities served by us or disruptions in our ability to service such facilities. There can be no assurance that such scrutiny and regulation will not lead to the shut-down of such facilities or otherwise cause material disruptions in our garment decontamination business. 
 In addition, our nuclear garment decontamination operations are subject to asset retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of our nuclear laundry facilities. We recognize as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission these facilities. The estimated liability is based on historical experience in decommissioning nuclear laundry facilities, estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, external vendor estimates as to the cost to decommission these assets in the future, and federal and state regulatory requirements. No assurances can be given that these accruals will be sufficient or that the costs of such decommissioning will not substantially exceed such accruals, as our facts, circumstances or estimates change, including changes in the Company s estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, estimated dates of decommissioning, changes in decommissioning costs, changes in federal or state regulatory guidance on the decommissioning of such facilities, or other changes in estimates. 
 In addition to contingencies and claims relating to environmental compliance matters, we may from time to time be subject to legal or regulatory proceedings and claims related to our business operations which may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 
 In addition to contingencies and claims relating to environmental compliance matters, we are subject from time to time to legal or regulatory proceedings, including, without limitation, with respect to tax matters, and to claims and disputes arising from the conduct of our business operations, including personal injury claims, customer contract matters and employment claims such as claims alleging violations of, and damages under, the Fair Labor Standards Act (the FLSA ). Refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies , of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Mexican federal tax authority issued a tax assessment on our subsidiary in Mexico for fiscal 2016 import taxes, value added taxes and custom processing fees of over 17.0 million, plus surcharges, fines and penalties of 67.7 million for a total assessment of 84.7 million, which accrues interest and other charges. We disagree with such tax assessment and are challenging the validity of the tax assessment through an appeal process. Certain of the claims to which we are subject are typically not covered by our available insurance. In addition, claims occasionally result in significant investigation and litigation expenses and, if successful, may result in material losses to us. Certain claims may also result in significant adverse publicity against us. As a consequence, successful claims against us not covered by our available insurance coverage or the adverse outcome of a legal or regulatory proceeding, or the impact of adverse publicity against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. 
 14 

Failure to comply with state, federal and other rules and regulations to which we are subject may result in penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Our business is subject to various state, federal, international and other rules and regulations, including employment laws and regulations such as the FLSA, minimum wage requirements, overtime requirements, working condition requirements, citizenship requirements, healthcare insurance mandates, data protection requirements, import and export requirements and restrictions and other laws, rules and regulations, including those of the SEC and NYSE and those relating to accounting. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with the laws and regulations to which we are subject. Any appreciable increase in the statutory minimum wage rate, income or overtime pay, costs of complying with healthcare insurance mandates, changes in the requirements under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, changes in environmental compliance requirements, or changes to immigration laws and citizenship requirements would likely result in an increase in our labor costs and/or contribute to a shortage of available labor and such cost increase or labor shortage, or the penalties for failing to comply with such statutory minimums or regulations, could have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity and results of operations. The impact of any new laws, rules and regulations, or changes to laws, rules and regulations, cannot be predicted and could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs. Any failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations could result in substantial fines or penalties by government authorities, payment of damages to private litigants or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could adversely affect our ability to service customers and our results of operations. 
 Changes in or new interpretations of the governmental regulatory framework may affect our contract terms and may reduce our sales or profits. 
 A portion of our total consolidated revenues is derived from business with U.S. federal, state and local governments and agencies. Changes or new interpretations in, or changes in the enforcement of, the statutory or regulatory framework applicable to services provided under governmental contracts or bidding procedures could result in fewer new contracts or contract renewals, modifications to the methods we apply to price government contracts or in contract terms of shorter duration than we have historically experienced, any of which could result in lower sales or profits than we have historically achieved, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 Adverse global financial and economic conditions may result in impairment of our goodwill and intangibles. 
 Our market capitalization, from time to time, has experienced volatility due in part to turbulent economic conditions and disruption in the global equity and credit markets. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. U.S. GAAP ), we may be required to record an impairment charge if changes in circumstances or events indicate that the carrying values of our goodwill and intangible assets exceed their fair value and are not recoverable. Any significant and other-than-temporary decrease in our market capitalization could be an indicator, when considered together with other factors, that the carrying values of our goodwill and intangible assets exceed their fair value, which may result in our recording an impairment charge. We are unable to predict economic trends, but we continue to monitor the impact of changes in economic and financial conditions on our operations and on the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets. Should the value 
 15 

of our acquired goodwill or one or more of our acquired intangibles become impaired, our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected. 
 The price of our Common Stock may be highly volatile, which could result in significant price declines. 
 The price of our Common Stock may experience significant volatility. Such volatility may be caused by fluctuations in our operating results, changes in earnings estimated by investment analysts, the number of shares of our Common Stock traded each day, the degree of success we achieve in implementing our business and growth strategies, changes in business or regulatory conditions affecting us, our customers or our competitors and other factors. In addition, the NYSE historically has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to, or disproportionate to, the operating performance of its listed companies. These fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. 
 If we are unable to accurately predict our future tax liabilities or become subject to increased levels of taxation or our tax contingencies are unfavorably resolved, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 The rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. taxation are regularly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department and other taxing authorities. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our Common Stock. Any such tax laws, regulations, interpretations, or rulings could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. These changes could subject us to additional income taxes and non-income taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, import, value-added, digital tax, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes), which in turn could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Additionally, new, changed, modified, or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could increase our customers and our compliance costs, operating and other costs, as well as the costs of our products. In recent years, many such changes have been made, and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. As we expand the scale of our business activities, any changes in the U.S. and non-U.S. taxation of such activities may increase our effective tax rate and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 In addition, we are also subject to tax audits in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business, including, but not limited to, various states, as well as Canada and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Quebec and New Brunswick, and Mexico. These audits can be complicated and can require several years to resolve. The final resolution of any such tax audit could result in an increase in our income tax and other tax liabilities. Although we believe that our current tax provisions are reasonable and appropriate, there can be no assurance that these items will be settled for the amounts accrued, that additional tax exposures will not be identified in the future or that additional tax reserves will not be necessary for any such exposures. Any increase in the amount of taxes we owe, including any fines or penalties, as a result of challenges to our tax filing positions could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies , of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion, including regarding the tax assessment matter in Mexico. 
 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVE D STAFF COMMENTS 
 None. 
 ITEM 2. PR OPERTIES 
 As of August 26, 2023, we owned or leased approximately 281 facilities containing an aggregate of approximately 8.6 million square feet located in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Europe and Nicaragua. We owned 143 of these facilities, containing approximately 6.4 million square feet. These facilities include our 325,000 square foot Owensboro, Kentucky distribution center and almost all of our industrial laundry processing plants. We believe our industrial laundry facilities are among the most modern in the industry. 
 We own substantially all of the machinery and equipment used in our operations. We believe that our facilities and our production, cleaning and decontamination equipment have been well maintained and are adequate for our present needs. We also own a fleet of approximately 4,375 delivery vans, trucks and other vehicles.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the current conduct of our business operations, including personal injury, customer contract, employment claims such as claims alleging violations of, and damages under, the FLSA and environmental and tax matters as described in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We maintain insurance coverage providing indemnification against many of such claims, and we do not expect that we will sustain any material loss as a result thereof. 
 In addition, we, like our competitors, are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other substances. In particular, industrial laundries currently use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues, and, in the past, have used perchloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents. We have settled, or contributed to the settlement of, past actions or claims brought against us relating to the disposal of hazardous materials at several sites and there can be no assurance that we will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future. Further, under environmental laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in or emanating from such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. There can be no assurance that our acquired or leased locations have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon us under such laws or expose us to third-party actions such as tort suits. Refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies , of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

 ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOC KHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 Common Stock Information 
 Our Common Stock trades on the NYSE under the symbol UNF , while our Class B Common Stock is not publicly traded. On July 11, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.310 per share of Common Stock and 0.248 per share of Class B Common Stock. Both dividends were paid on September 28, 2023 to shareholders of record as of September 7, 2023. The amount and timing of any future dividend payment is subject to the approval of the Board of Directors each quarter. 
 The approximate number of shareholders of record of our Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as of October 20, 2023 was 48 and 43, respectively. We believe that the number of beneficial owners of our Common Stock is substantially greater than the number of record holders because a large portion of our Common Stock is held of record in broker street names . 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 On October 18, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase from time to time up to 100.0 million of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, inclusive of the amount which remained available under the existing share repurchase program approved in January 2019, which program has no scheduled expiration date. We did not repurchase any shares of our Common Stock during the quarter ended August 26, 2023. As of August 26, 2023, the Company had 63.6 million remaining to repurchase under the share repurchase program. 
 Repurchases made under the program, if any, will continue to be made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including economic and market conditions, the trading price of our Common Stock, corporate liquidity requirements and priorities, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The share repurchase program has been funded to date using our available cash and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Business Overview 
 UniFirst Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, hereunder referred to as we , our , the Company , or UniFirst , is one of the leading providers of workplace uniforms and protective work wear clothing in the U.S. We design, manufacture, personalize, rent, clean, deliver, and sell a wide range of uniforms and protective clothing, including shirts, pants, jackets, coveralls, lab coats, smocks, aprons and specialized protective wear, such as flame resistant and high visibility garments. We also rent and sell industrial wiping products, floor mats, facility service products and other non-garment items, and provide restroom and cleaning supplies and first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies as well as provide certain safety training to a variety of manufacturers, retailers and service companies. 
 We serve businesses of all sizes in numerous industry categories. Typical customers include automobile service centers and dealers, delivery services, food and general merchandise retailers, food processors and service operations, light manufacturers, maintenance facilities, restaurants, service companies, soft and durable goods wholesalers, transportation companies, healthcare providers and others who require employee clothing for image, identification, protection or utility purposes. We also provide our customers with restroom and cleaning supplies, including air fresheners, paper products and hand soaps. 
 At certain specialized facilities, we also decontaminate and clean work clothes and other items that may have been exposed to radioactive materials and service special cleanroom protective wear and facilities. Typical customers for these specialized services include government agencies, research and development laboratories, high technology companies and utilities operating nuclear reactors. 
 Headquartered in Wilmington, Massachusetts, we are a North American leader in the supply and servicing of uniform and workwear programs, as well as the delivery of facility service programs. Together with our subsidiaries, we also provide first aid and safety products, and manage specialized garment programs for the cleanroom and nuclear industries. We manufacture our own branded workwear, protective clothing, and floorcare products, as well as offer products from industry leading suppliers; and with 270 service locations, over 300,000 customer locations, and approximately 16,000 employee Team Partners, we outfit more than 2 million workers each business day. 
 U.S. GAAP establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information of those segments to be presented in interim financial reports issued to shareholders. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. Our chief operating decision-maker is our Chief Executive Officer. We have six operating segments based on the information reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer: U.S. Rental and Cleaning, Canadian Rental and Cleaning, Manufacturing MFG ), Specialty Garments Rental and Cleaning Specialty Garments ), First Aid and Corporate. The U.S. Rental and Cleaning and Canadian Rental and Cleaning operating segments have been combined to form the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. Refer to Note 15, Segment Reporting , of our Consolidated Financial Statements for our disclosure of segment information. 
 The U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment purchases, rents, cleans, delivers and sells, uniforms and protective clothing and non-garment items in the U.S. and Canada. The operations of the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment are referred to by us as our industrial laundry operations and we refer to the locations related to this reporting segment as our industrial laundries . 
 The MFG operating segment designs and manufactures uniforms and non-garment items primarily for the purpose of providing these goods to the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. The amounts reflected as revenues of MFG are primarily generated when goods are shipped from our manufacturing facilities, or subcontract manufacturers, to our other locations. These intercompany revenues are recorded at a transfer price which is typically in excess of the actual manufacturing cost. Products are carried in inventory and subsequently placed in service and amortized at this transfer price. On a consolidated basis, intercompany MFG revenues and MFG income are eliminated and the carrying value of inventories and rental merchandise in service is reduced to the manufacturing cost. Income before income taxes from MFG, net of the intercompany MFG elimination, offsets the merchandise amortization costs incurred by the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment as the merchandise costs of this reporting segment are amortized and recognized based on inventories purchased from MFG at the transfer price which is above our manufacturing cost. 
 The Corporate operating segment consists of costs associated with our distribution center, sales and marketing, information systems, engineering, materials management, manufacturing planning, finance, budgeting, human resources, other general and administrative costs and interest expense. The revenues generated from the Corporate operating segment represent 
 21 

certain direct sales made directly from our distribution center. The products sold by this operating segment are the same products rented and sold by the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. In the segment disclosures in Note 15, Segment Reporting , of our Consolidated Financial Statements, no assets or capital expenditures are presented for the Corporate operating segment as no assets are allocated to this operating segment in the information reviewed by our chief executive officer. However, depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets are reflected in income from operations and income before income taxes for the Corporate operating segment. The assets that give rise to this depreciation and amortization are included in the total assets of the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment as this is how they are tracked and reviewed by us. 
 We refer to our U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning, MFG, and Corporate segments combined as our Core Laundry Operations . 
 The Specialty Garments operating segment purchases, rents, cleans, delivers and sells, specialty garments and non-garment items primarily for nuclear and cleanroom applications and provides cleanroom cleaning services at limited customer locations. The First Aid operating segment sells first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies as well as maintains wholesale distribution and pill packaging operations. 
 Approximately 87.8 of our revenues in fiscal 2023 were derived from our U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning and Corporate segments. A key driver of this business is the number of workers employed by our customers. Our revenues are directly impacted by fluctuations in these employment levels. Revenues from Specialty Garments, which accounted for approximately 8.0 of our fiscal 2023 revenues, increase during outages and refueling by nuclear power plants, as garment usage increases at these times. First Aid represented approximately 4.2 of our total revenues in fiscal 2023. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Use of Estimates 
 We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We utilize key estimates in preparing the financial statements, including casualty and environmental estimates, valuation of intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination, recoverability of goodwill, intangibles, income taxes and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on historical information, current trends, and information available from other sources. Our results are affected by economic, political, legislative, regulatory and legal actions. Economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, interest and monetary exchange rates, government fiscal policies, and changes in the prices of raw materials, can have a significant effect on operations. These factors and other events could cause actual results to differ from management's estimates. 
 Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 We recognize revenue from rental operations and related services in the period in which the services are provided. Direct sale revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are performed or when the product is shipped. Our judgment and estimates are used in determining the collectability of accounts receivable and evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts as well as our sales credits reserve. We consider specific accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and the age of outstanding balances as part of our evaluation in assessing the allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider our historical credit experience in assessing the sales credits reserve. Changes in our estimates are reflected in the period they become known. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Material changes in our estimates may result in significant differences in the amount and timing of bad debt expense recognition for any given period. Our revenues do not include taxes we collect from our customers and remit to governmental authorities. 
 Costs to Obtain a Contract 
 We defer commission expenses paid to employee-partners when the commissions are deemed to be incremental for obtaining the route servicing customer contract. The deferred commissions are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which is generally the estimated life of the customer relationship. We review the deferred commission balances for impairment on an ongoing basis. Deferred commissions are classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the expense. The current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other current 
 22 

assets and the non-current portion is included in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of August 26, 2023, the current and non-current assets related to deferred commissions totaled 16.5 million and 70.4 million, respectively. As of August 27, 2022, the current and non-current assets related to deferred commissions totaled 15.2 million and 65.1 million, respectively. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recorded 16.5 million and 15.4 million, respectively, of amortization expense related to deferred commissions. This expense is classified in selling and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 Inventories and Rental Merchandise in Service 
 Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, net of any reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. Judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to our customers or used in our rental operations. Historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories. If actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than the amount we projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. We use the first-in, first-out method to value our inventories, which primarily consist of finished goods. Rental merchandise in service is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of the merchandise, which range from six to thirty-six months. In establishing estimated lives for merchandise in service, our management considers historical experience and the intended use of the merchandise. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating profit for any period if we make significant changes to our estimates. 
 Goodwill, Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets 
 In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we do not amortize goodwill. Instead, we test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Our evaluation considers changes in the operating environment, competitive information, market trends, operating performance and cash flow modeling. 
 We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. There have been no impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets in fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021. 
 We cannot predict future economic conditions and their impact on us or the future net realizable value of our stock. A decline in our market capitalization and/or deterioration in general economic conditions could negatively and materially impact our assumptions and assessment of the fair value of our business. If general economic conditions or our financial performance deteriorate, we may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge in the future which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Property, plant and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on our estimates of the period that the assets will generate economic benefits. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. There were no material impairments of long-lived assets in fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021. 
 Business Combinations 
 The Company accounts for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value of the consideration paid, including contingent consideration, is assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
 The Company s management exercises significant judgments in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as intangibles and their estimated useful lives. Fair value and useful life determinations are based on, among other factors, estimates of future expected cash flows, royalty cost savings and appropriate discount rates used in computing present values. These judgments may materially impact the estimates used in allocating acquisition date fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the Company s current and future operating results. Actual results may vary from these estimates which may result in adjustments to goodwill and acquisition date fair values of assets and liabilities during a measurement period or upon a final determination of asset and liability fair values, whichever occurs first. Adjustments to the fair value of assets and liabilities made after the end of the measurement period are recorded within the Company s operating results. 
 
 23 

Insurance 
 We self-insure for certain obligations related to health and dental, workers compensation, vehicles and general liability programs. We also purchase stop-loss insurance policies for workers compensation, vehicles and general liability programs to protect ourselves from catastrophic losses. Judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for events that have occurred but have not been reported. Our estimates consider historical claim experience and other factors. Our liabilities are based on our estimates, and, while we believe that our accruals are adequate, the ultimate liability may be significantly different from the amounts recorded. In certain cases where partial insurance coverage exists, we must estimate the portion of the liability that will be covered by existing insurance policies to arrive at our net expected liability. Receivables for insurance recoveries are recorded as assets, on an undiscounted basis. Changes in our claim experience, our ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments we use could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any given period. 
 Environmental and Other Contingencies 
 We are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of our business operations, including environmental matters, personal injury, customer contract matters and employment claims. U.S. GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred, and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. We regularly consult with our attorneys and outside consultants, in our consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, before recording a contingent liability. We record accruals for environmental and other contingencies based on enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, our estimates of costs, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, and the input of our attorneys and outside consultants. 
 The estimated liability for environmental contingencies has been discounted as of August 26, 2023 using risk-free interest rates ranging from 4.3 to 4.7 over periods ranging from three to thirty years. The estimated current costs, net of legal settlements with insurance carriers, have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at 3.0 per year. Changes in enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, our estimates of costs, risk-free interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, the input of our attorneys and outside consultants or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for our environmental and other contingent liabilities. Refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies , of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion and analysis. 
 Asset Retirement Obligations 
 Under U.S. GAAP, asset retirement obligations generally apply to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or the normal operation of a long-lived asset. Current accounting guidance requires that we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. 
 We have recognized as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission our nuclear laundry facilities in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We depreciate, on a straight-line basis, the amount added to property, plant and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the various remaining lives which range from approximately one to twenty-one years. 
 Our estimated liability has been based on historical experience in decommissioning nuclear laundry facilities, estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, external vendor estimates as to the cost to decommission these assets in the future, and federal and state regulatory requirements. The estimated current costs have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at 3 per year. The liability has been discounted using credit-adjusted risk-free rates that range from approximately 7.0 to 7.5 . Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, estimated dates of decommissioning, changes in decommissioning costs, changes in federal or state regulatory guidance on the decommissioning of such facilities, or other changes in estimates. Changes due to revisions in our estimates are recognized by adjusting the carrying amount of the liability and the related long-lived asset if the assets are still in service or charged to expense in the period if the assets are no longer in service. 
 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and Pension Plan 
 We recognize pension expense on an accrual basis over our employees estimated service periods. Pension expense is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements. 
 24 

The calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires us to use a number of critical assumptions, including the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, the assumed discount rate, the assumed rate of compensation increases and life expectancy of participants. Changes in our assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual expense can differ from these assumptions. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future. 
 Income Taxes 
 We compute income tax expense by jurisdiction based on our operations in each jurisdiction. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the amounts recognized for income tax and financial reporting purposes at currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. See Note 4, Income Taxes of our Consolidated Financial Statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. We regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized. 
 We are periodically reviewed by U.S. domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews typically include inquiries regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, we record estimated reserves . Refer to Note 4, Income Taxes , of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our accounting for income taxes and our uncertain tax positions for financial accounting purposes. 
 Effects of Inflation and Current Economic Conditions 
 In general, we believe that our results of operations are not dependent on moderate changes in the inflation rate. Historically, we have been able to manage the impacts of more significant changes in inflation rates through our customer relationships, customer agreements that generally provide for price increases and continued focus on improvements of operational productivity. However, the current inflationary environment has had a negative impact on our margins, including as a result of increased energy costs for our vehicles and our plants, as well as increasing wages in the labor markets in which we compete. Inflation could continue to pressure our margins in future periods. In addition, in response to the concerns over inflation risk in the broader U.S. economy, the U.S. Federal Reserve has increased its benchmark interest rate significantly and has signaled that it may approve one additional rate increase in 2023. Interest rates may remain high and/or continue to increase in 2024. Adverse economic conditions resulting from inflationary pressures, U.S. Federal Reserve actions, including continued high interest rates and/or increases in interest rates, geopolitical issues or otherwise are difficult to predict and may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of risks and potential risks of inflation and adverse economic conditions on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

General 
 We derive our revenues through the design, manufacture, personalization, rental, cleaning, delivering, and selling of a wide range of uniforms and protective clothing, including shirts, pants, jackets, coveralls, lab coats, smocks and aprons and specialized protective wear, such as flame resistant and high visibility garments. We also rent industrial wiping products, floor mats, facility service products, other non-garment items, and provide restroom and cleaning supplies and first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies, to a variety of manufacturers, retailers and service companies. 
 Cost of revenues include the amortization of rental merchandise in service and merchandise costs related to direct sales as well as labor and other production, service and delivery costs, and distribution costs associated with operating our Core Laundry Operations, Specialty Garments facilities, and First Aid locations. Selling and administrative costs include costs related to our sales and marketing functions as well as general and administrative costs associated with our corporate offices, non-operating environmental sites and operating locations including information systems, engineering, materials management, manufacturing planning, finance, budgeting, and human resources. 
 Our operating results are also directly impacted by the costs of the gasoline used to fuel our vehicles and the natural gas used to operate our plants. Our operating margins have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by volatility in energy prices. In addition, as described above, the current inflationary environment has had a negative impact on our margins, and could continue to pressure our margins in future periods. 
 Our business is subject to various state and federal regulations, including employment laws and regulations, minimum wage requirements, overtime requirements, working condition requirements, citizenship requirements, healthcare insurance mandates and other laws and regulations that impact our labor costs. Labor costs have increased recently as a result of increases in state and local minimum wage levels as well as the overall impact of wage pressure as the result of a low unemployment environment. 
 A portion of our sales is derived from international markets, including Canada. Revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar represented approximately 7.0 and 7.9 of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The operating results of our international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars and such results are affected by movements in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, a weaker Canadian dollar increases the costs to our Canadian operations of merchandise and other operational inputs that are sourced from outside Canada, which has the effect of reducing the operating margins of our Canadian business if we are unable to recover these additional costs through price adjustments with our Canadian customers. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, foreign currency fluctuations impacted our consolidated revenues negatively by 0.6 and 0.1 , respectively. These impacts were primarily driven by fluctuations in the Canadian dollar. Our operating results in future years could be negatively impacted by any further devaluation, as compared to the U.S. dollar, of the Canadian dollar or any of the currencies of the other countries in which we operate. 
 In fiscal 2018, we initiated a multiyear CRM project to further develop, implement and deploy a third-party application we licensed. This new solution is intended to improve functionality, capability and information flow as well as increase automation in servicing our customers. We began deployment of our new CRM project during the second half of fiscal 2021 and while deployment of the CRM system is substantially complete in the U.S., we continue to work on the implementation and operation of the system. We are depreciating this system over a 10-year life and recognized 3.3 million and 3.2 million of amortization expense in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. 
 In fiscal 2022, we initiated a multiyear ERP project that will continue through 2027, with early phases focused on master data management and finance capabilities followed by subsequent phases with a strong focus on supply chain and procurement automation and technology. We believe that this initiative will become the core of the UniFirst technology footprint and will integrate and complement the capabilities of the CRM system that we are currently deploying. We expect this system and the supply chain and procurement capabilities that it will provide to enable lower operating costs and customer churn through enhanced inventory utilization and vendor management, improved response times to customer orders and more efficient back-end processes. These capabilities will allow us to more effectively respond to and mitigate the types of supply chain challenges that we experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and that we continue to experience primarily as a result of the current inflationary environment. 
 27 

We have been focused on the three discrete strategic initiatives that are critical in our efforts to transform the Company in terms of our overall capabilities and competitive positioning. These initiatives are the continued rollout of our new CRM system, implementation of the ERP system (each discussed above) as well as increased investments in the UniFirst brand. Such increased investments in the UniFirst brand concluded in fiscal 2023. We refer to these initiatives together as our Key Initiatives . In fiscal 2023, we incurred 17.8 million, 4.8 million and 11.0 million of costs related to our CRM system, UniFirst branding project and ERP system, respectively, for a total of 33.6 million directly attributable to our Key Initiatives. As of August 26, 2023, we had capitalized 45.2 million related to our CRM project and 2.2 million related to our ERP project. 
 On October 25, 2022, we raised our quarterly dividend to 0.31 per share of Common Stock and to 0.248 per share of Class B Common Stock, up from 0.30 and 0.24 per share, respectively. 
 On October 24, 2023, we announced that we would be raising our quarterly dividend to 0.33 per share of Common Stock and to 0.264 per share of Class B Common Stock, up from 0.31 and 0.248 per share, respectively. The amount and timing of any dividend payment is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors each quarter. 
 On October 24, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to 100.0 million of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, inclusive of the amount which remained available under the existing share repurchase program approved on October 18, 2021. Repurchases made under the new program, if any, will be made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including economic and market conditions, our stock price, corporate liquidity requirements and priorities, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The share repurchase program may be funded using available cash or capacity under our Credit Agreement (as defined below) and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal 2023, we did not repurchase any shares. During fiscal 2022, we repurchased 0.2 million shares for an average price per share of 179.98. As of August 26, 2023, we had 63.6 million remaining under our existing share repurchase program. 
 On March 9, 2023, we exercised the accordion feature of the Credit Agreement pursuant to an amendment to the Credit Agreement. The exercise of the accordion feature increases the aggregate commitments under the Credit Agreement by 100.0 million, for a total aggregate commitment of up to 275.0 million. In addition, the amendment provides for the replacement of LIBOR with SOFR such that borrowings are based on, at our election, the SOFR rate or a base rate, plus in each case a spread based on our consolidated funded debt ratio. The amendment also refreshed the accordion feature, so that, provided there is no default or event of default under the Credit Agreement and we are in compliance with our financial covenants on a pro forma basis, we may request an increase in the aggregate commitments under the Credit Agreement (in the form of revolving or term tranches) of up to an additional 100.0 million, for a total aggregate commitment of up to 375.0 million. 
 On March 13, 2023, we completed our acquisition of the business and certain real estate assets of Clean from Clean Holdco, Inc. and certain of its affiliates for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 299.1 million, net of cash acquired. Clean is a uniform, workwear and facility service program provider with 11 locations covering Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas, Kansas and Oklahoma. The results of operations from Clean were included in our results under the Core Laundry Operations segment subsequent to the acquisition date of March 13, 2023. We paid for the acquisition of Clean with cash on hand and borrowings under the Credit Agreement, which we repaid in full during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Transaction and related costs, consisting primarily of professional fees, directly related to the acquisition, totaled approximately 3.0 million for fiscal 2023. All transaction and related costs were expensed as incurred and are included in selling and administrative expenses. 
 Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in August. For financial reporting purposes, fiscal 2023 and 2022 both consisted of 52 weeks.

11.6 

The increase in consolidated revenues of 11.6 during fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year was due primarily to growth in our Core Laundry Operations of 10.8 . The increase in our Core Laundry Operations was due to organic growth of 8.5 , the effect of Canadian dollar exchange rate changes on our revenues of (0.5) , and acquisition related growth of 2.8 . The Core Laundry Operations strong organic growth rate was primarily the result of pricing efforts over the last year to share with our customers the cost increases that we have incurred due to the ongoing inflationary environment and solid new account sales. The impact on our revenues from acquisitions was primarily the result of our acquisition of Clean, which was completed on March 13, 2023. During fiscal 2023, Clean accounted for 43.0 million of revenue, which was included in Core Laundry Operations. 
 Specialty Garments revenues for fiscal 2023 increased compared to the prior fiscal year due primarily to growth in our North American nuclear operations and our cleanroom operations. North American nuclear operations accounted for growth of 8.5 , due primarily to increased project work in fiscal 2023 and the cleanroom revenue growth accounted for growth of 7.1 . European nuclear operations effect on Specialty Garments revenue growth was minimal as it accounted for growth of 0.2 . Specialty Garments results are often affected by seasonality and the timing and length of our customers power reactor outages as well as our project-based activities. 
 First Aid revenues for fiscal 2023 increased compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was driven primarily by increased activity in the wholesale distribution business, which accounted for growth of 12.0 and our continued investment in expanding the first aid van business, which accounted for growth of 10.5 .

The increase in selling and administrative costs of 10.1 during fiscal 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year was due primarily to additional investments we are making in our support functions due to our growth and in support of our ongoing technology initiatives. Also contributing to the increase were 3.0 million of Clean acquisition-related costs in fiscal 2023 and an additional 0.5 million of costs to support our Key Initiatives compared to the prior year comparable period.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled 89.6 million as of August 26, 2023, a decrease of 286.8 million from 376.4 million as of August 27, 2022. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was largely driven by our purchase of Clean for 299.1 million, net of cash, and continued investment in our business with capital expenditures. We generated 215.8 million and 122.6 million in cash from operating activities in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 As described above, on March 13, 2023, we completed our acquisition of the business and certain real estate assets of Clean and certain of its affiliates for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 299.1 million, net cash acquired of 3.3 million. Clean is a uniform, workwear and facility service program provider with 11 locations covering Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas, Kansas and Oklahoma. We borrowed and repaid 80.0 million from our Credit Agreement (as defined below) during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to finance the acquisition of Clean and fund our day-to-day operations. 
 On March 9, 2023, we exercised the accordion feature of the Credit Agreement pursuant to an amendment to the Credit Agreement. The exercise of the accordion feature increases the aggregate commitments under the Credit Agreement by 
 30 

100.0 million, for a total aggregate commitment of up to 275.0 million. In addition, the amendment provides for the replacement of LIBOR with SOFR such that borrowings are based on, at our election, the SOFR rate or a base rate, plus in each case a spread based on our consolidated funded debt ratio. The amendment also refreshed the accordion feature, so that, provided there is no default or event of default under the Credit Agreement and we are in compliance with our financial covenants on a pro forma basis, we may request an increase in the aggregate commitments under the Credit Agreement (in the form of revolving or term tranches) of up to an additional 100.0 million, for a total aggregate commitment of up to 375.0 million. 
 We did not repurchase any shares of our Common Stock during fiscal 2023 pursuant to our share repurchase program. 
 We believe, although there can be no assurance, that our current cash and cash equivalents balances, our cash generated from future operations and amounts available under our Credit Agreement (as defined below) will be sufficient to meet our current anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months and will help us manage the impacts of inflation and address related liquidity needs. 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities have historically been the primary source of our liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations, capital expenditure and acquisition activities as well as dividends on our Common Stock. We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from long-term debt, to fund growth and acquisition opportunities, as well as other cash requirements.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 The net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023 increased as compared to fiscal 2022 due to positive impacts from receivables of 18.9 million, accrued liabilities of 18.8 million, rental merchandise in service of 15.7 million, prepaid and accrued income taxes of 15.6 million, inventories of 12.1 million and accounts payable of 11.0 million. 
 The positive impact from receivables was due primarily to a focused effort on collections and timing. The positive impact from inventories and merchandise in service was due primarily to a focused effort on managing our inventory balances in the current year and our balance sheet position continuing to normalize coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accounts payable had a positive impact on cash flows due to the timing of invoices. The positive impact of accrued liabilities was due to higher casualty and compensation accruals. Lastly, the positive impact from prepaid and accrued taxes was due to fewer overpayments for U.S. federal income taxes for fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 The net increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2023 was primarily the result of our acquisition of Clean, which was completed on March 13, 2023 for a purchase price, net of cash acquired, of approximately 299.1 million. Also contributing to the increases during fiscal 2023 as compared to the prior fiscal year were additional capital expenditures of 27.7 million and the purchases of certificates of deposit (net of maturing certificates of deposit) during fiscal 2023 of 10.0 million. 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2023 was due primarily to no Common Stock repurchases during fiscal 2023 as compared to 44.4 million of repurchases in the prior fiscal period. Furthermore, there was also a decrease in taxes withheld and paid related to net-share settlement of equity awards of 1.2 million. During fiscal 2023, we borrowed and repaid 80.0 million under our Credit Agreement. The funds were used primarily to finance the acquisition of Clean. This was partially offset by an increase in dividends paid of 1.3 million.

Long-term Debt and Borrowing Capacity 
 On March 26, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated 175.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement (as subsequently amended, the Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks, which matures on March 26, 2026. The Credit Agreement amended and restated our prior credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature on April 11, 2021. Under the Credit Agreement, we are able to borrow funds at variable interest rates. Prior to the amendment discussed below, interest on borrowings was based on, at our election, the Eurodollar rate or a base rate, plus in each case a spread based on our consolidated funded debt ratio. 
 On March 9, 2023, we exercised the accordion feature of the Credit Agreement pursuant to an amendment to the Credit Agreement. The exercise of the accordion feature increases the aggregate commitments under the Credit Agreement by 100.0 million, for a total aggregate commitment of up to 275.0 million. In addition, the amendment provides for the replacement of LIBOR with SOFR such that borrowings are based on, at our election, the SOFR rate or a base rate, plus in each case a spread based on our consolidated funded debt ratio. The amendment also refreshed the accordion feature, so that, provided there is no default or event of default under the Credit Agreement and we are in compliance with our financial covenants on a pro forma basis, we may request an increase in the aggregate commitments under the Credit Agreement (in the form of revolving or term tranches) of up to an additional 100.0 million, for a total aggregate commitment of up to 375.0 million. Availability of credit requires compliance with certain financial and other covenants, including a maximum consolidated funded debt ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement. We test our compliance with these financial covenants on a fiscal quarterly basis. As of August 26, 2023, the interest rates applicable to our borrowings under the Credit Agreement would be calculated as SOFR plus 1.00 at the time of the respective borrowing. 
 During fiscal 2023, we borrowed 80.0 million under our Credit Agreement to finance the acquisition of Clean and fund our day-to-day operations. All borrowings were repaid as of August 26, 2023 and we had no outstanding amounts under our Credit Agreement as of August 26, 2023. As of August 26, 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit amounting to 66.5 million, leaving 208.5 million available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement. 
 As of August 26, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 In August 2021, we entered into twenty forward contracts to exchange CAD for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage our exposure related to certain forecasted CAD denominated sales of one of our subsidiaries. The hedged transactions are specified as the first amount of CAD denominated revenues invoiced by one of our domestic subsidiaries each fiscal quarter, beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 and continuing through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2026. In total, we will sell approximately 14.1 million CAD at an average Canadian-dollar exchange rate of 0.7861 over these quarterly periods. We concluded that the forward contracts met the criteria to qualify as a cash flow hedge under U.S. GAAP. 
 As of August 26, 2023, we had forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 5.4 million CAD outstanding and recorded the fair value of the contracts of 0.2 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets with a corresponding gain of 0.2 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which was recorded net of tax. During fiscal 2023, we reclassified 0.1 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to revenue, related to the derivative financial instruments. The gain on these forward contracts that results in a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss as of August 26, 2023 is expected to be reclassified to revenues prior to their maturity on August 29, 2026. 
 Environmental and Legal Contingencies 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other substances. In particular, industrial laundries currently use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues, and, in the past, used perchloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents. We are attentive to the environmental concerns surrounding the disposal of these materials and have, through the years, taken measures to avoid their improper disposal. We have settled, or contributed to the settlement of, past actions or claims brought against us relating to the disposal of hazardous materials at several sites and there can be no assurance that we will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future. 
 U.S. GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. We regularly consult with attorneys and outside consultants in our consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances before recording a contingent liability. Changes in enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, our estimates of costs, risk-free interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of 
 32 

payments, the input of our attorneys and outside consultants or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for our environmental and other contingent liabilities. 
 Under environmental laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on, or in, or emanating from, such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. There can be no assurances that acquired or leased locations have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon our Company under such laws or expose our Company to third party actions such as tort suits. We continue to address environmental conditions under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise with respect to certain sites. 
 We have accrued certain costs related to certain sites, including but not limited to, sites in Woburn and Somerville, Massachusetts, as it has been determined that the costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We, together with multiple other companies, are party to a consent decree related to our property and the Central Area in Woburn, Massachusetts. The EPA has provided us and other signatories to the consent decree with comments on the design and implementation of groundwater and soil remedies at the Woburn site and investigation of environmental conditions in the Central Area. The consent decree does not address any remediation work that may be required in the Central Area. We, and other signatories, have implemented and proposed to do additional work at the Woburn site but many of the EPA s comments remain to be resolved. We have accrued costs to perform certain work responsive to the EPA s comments. Additionally, we have implemented mitigation measures and continue to monitor environmental conditions at a site in Somerville, Massachusetts. We have agreed to undertake additional actions responsive to a notice of audit findings from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection concerning a regulatory submittal that we made in 2009 for a portion of the site. We have received demands from the local transit authority for reimbursement of certain costs associated with its construction of a new municipal transit station in the area of the Somerville site. This station is part of an ongoing extension of the transit system. We have reserved for costs in connection with this matter; however, in light of the uncertainties associated with this matter, these costs and the related reserve may change. 
 We routinely review and evaluate sites that may require remediation and monitoring and determine our estimated costs based on various estimates and assumptions. These estimates are developed using our internal sources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: 
 Management s judgment and experience in remediating and monitoring our sites; 

Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation and monitoring; 

The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) who may be liable for remediation and monitoring of a specific site; and 

The typical allocation of costs among PRPs. 

There is usually a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with each site. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, our accruals represent the amount within the range that we believe is the best estimate or the low end of a range of estimates if no point within the range is a better estimate. When we believe that both the amount of a particular liability and the timing of the payments are reliably determinable, we adjust the cost in current dollars using a rate of 3 for inflation until the time of expected payment and discount the cost to present value using current risk-free interest rates. As of August 26, 2023, the risk-free interest rates we utilized ranged from 4.3 to 4.7 . 
 For environmental liabilities that have been discounted, we include interest accretion, based on the effective interest method, in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Estimated insurance proceeds are primarily received from an annuity received as part of our legal settlement with an insurance company. Annual proceeds of approximately 0.3 million are deposited into an escrow account which funds remediation and monitoring costs for two sites related to our former operations. Annual proceeds received but not expended in the current year accumulate in this account and may be used in future years for costs related to this site through the year 2027. As of August 26, 2023, the balance in this escrow account, which is held in a trust and is not recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, was approximately 5.2 million. Also included in estimated insurance proceeds are amounts we are entitled to receive pursuant to legal settlements as reimbursements from three insurance companies for estimated costs at one of our sites. 
 Our nuclear garment decontamination facilities are licensed by respective state agencies, as delegated authority by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the NRC pursuant to the NRC s Agreement State program and are subject to applicable federal and state radioactive material regulations. In addition, our international locations (Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union) are regulated by equivalent respective jurisdictional authorities. There can be no assurance that such regulation will not lead to material disruptions in our garment decontamination business. 
 From time to time, we are also subject to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of our business operations, including personal injury claims, customer contract matters, employment claims and environmental matters as described above. 
 In addition, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Mexican federal tax authority issued a tax assessment on our subsidiary in Mexico for fiscal 2016 import taxes, value added taxes and custom processing fees of over 17.0 million, plus surcharges, fines and penalties of over 67.7 million for a total assessment of over 84.7 million, which accrues interest and other charges. We disagree with such tax assessment and are challenging the validity of the tax assessment through an appeal process. While we are unable to ascertain the ultimate outcome of this matter, based on the information currently available, we believe that a loss with respect to this matter is neither probable nor remote. Given the uncertainty associated with the ultimate resolution of this matter, we are unable to reasonably assess an estimate or range of estimates of any potential losses. 
 While it is impossible for us to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to contingent liabilities, including lawsuits and environmental contingencies, we believe that the aggregate amount of such liabilities, if any, in excess of amounts covered by insurance have been properly accrued in accordance with accounting principles under U.S. GAAP. It is possible, however, that the future financial position and/or results of operations for any particular future period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies or changes out of our control. 
 Acquisitions 
 As part of our business, we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other garment service companies. In recent years, we have typically paid for acquisitions with cash and may continue to do so in the future. To pay for an acquisition, we may use cash on hand, cash generated from operations or borrowings under our Credit Agreement, or we may pursue other forms of debt financing. Our ability to secure short-term and long-term debt financing in the future will depend on several factors, including our future profitability, our levels of debt and equity, and the overall credit and equity market environments.

 We have uncertain tax positions that are fully reserved totaling 7.8 million as of August 26, 2023 that are excluded from the above table as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. 
 We have accrued 30.0 million in costs related to certain environmental obligations we have to address under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise. Refer to Environmental and Legal Contingencies , above for additional discussion on our environmental obligations. 
 As discussed above under Long-Term Debt and Borrowing Capacity , as of August 26, 2023, we had borrowing capacity of 375.0 million under our Credit Agreement, of which approximately 208.5 million was available for borrowing. Also, as of such date, we had no outstanding borrowings and letters of credit outstanding of 66.5 million. All letters of credit expire in less than one year. 
 As discussed above under Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , as of August 26, 2023, we had forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 5.4 million CAD outstanding and recorded the fair value of the contracts of 0.2 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets with a corresponding gain of 0.2 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which was recorded net of tax. During fiscal 2023, we reclassified 0.1 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to revenue, related to the derivative financial instruments. The gain on these forward contracts that results in a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss as of August 26, 2023 is expected to be reclassified to revenues prior to their maturity on August 29, 2026. 
 Energy Costs 
 Significant variability in energy costs, specifically with respect to natural gas and gasoline, can materially affect our operating costs. During fiscal 2023, our energy costs, which include fuel, natural gas, and electricity, represented approximately 4.3 of our total revenue.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We have determined that all of our foreign subsidiaries operate primarily in local currencies that represent the functional currencies of such subsidiaries. All assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. The effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of assets and liabilities are recorded as a component of shareholders equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during each month of the fiscal year. As such, our financial condition and operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to currencies in foreign countries. Revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar represented approximately 7.0 , 7.9 and 8.4 of our total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Total assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar represented approximately 6.6 and 6.8 of our total consolidated assets at August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022, respectively. If exchange rates had increased or decreased by 10 from the actual rates in effect during fiscal 2023, our revenues and assets for the year ended and as of August 26, 2023 would have increased or decreased by approximately 0.2 million and 17.1 million, respectively. 
 In August 2021, we entered into twenty forward contracts to exchange CAD for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage our exposure related to certain forecasted CAD denominated sales of one of our subsidiaries. The hedged transactions are specified as the first amount of CAD denominated revenues invoiced by one of our domestic subsidiaries each fiscal quarter, beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 and continuing through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2026. In total, we will sell approximately 14.1 million CAD at an average Canadian-dollar exchange rate of 0.7861 over these quarterly periods. We concluded that the forward contracts met the criteria to qualify as a cash flow hedge under U.S. GAAP. 
 As of August 26, 2023, we had forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 5.4 million CAD outstanding and recorded the fair value of the contracts of 0.2 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets with a corresponding gain of 0.2 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which was recorded net of tax. During fiscal 2023, we reclassified 0.1 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to revenue, related to the derivative financial instruments. The gain on these forward contracts that results in a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss as of August 26, 2023 is expected to be reclassified to revenues prior to their maturity on August 29, 2026. 
 Other than the forward contracts discussed above, we do not operate a hedging program to mitigate the effect of a significant change in the value of the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, which include the Canadian dollar, euro, British pound, Mexican peso and Nicaraguan cordoba, as compared to the U.S. dollar. Any losses or gains resulting from unhedged foreign currency transactions, including exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany accounts are reported as transaction losses (gains) in our other expense, net. The intercompany payables and receivables are denominated in Canadian dollars, euros, British pounds, Mexican pesos and Nicaraguan cordobas. During fiscal 2023 transaction losses included in other expense, net, was 0.5 million. If exchange rates had changed by 10 during fiscal 2023, we would have recognized exchange gains or losses of approximately 1.2 million. 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, which may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations, we manage exposures through our operating and financing activities. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowings under our Credit Agreement. During fiscal 2023, we borrowed and repaid 80.0 million under the Credit Agreement. Under the Credit Agreement, we borrow funds at variable interest rates based on, at our election, the SOFR rate or a base rate, plus in each case a spread based on our consolidated funded debt ratio. To the extent we have borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement, changes in interest rates result in changes in our interest expense. 
 Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of risks and potential risks on our business, financial performance and the market price of our Common Stock.

 reporting segments: U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning, Manufacturing MFG ), Specialty Garments Rental and Cleaning Specialty Garments ), First Aid and Corporate. The operations of the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment are referred to by the Company as its industrial laundry operations and the locations related to this reporting segment are referred to as industrial laundries . The Company refers to its U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning, MFG, and Corporate segments combined as its Core Laundry Operations . The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant adverse impact on the Company s revenues in the first half of fiscal 2021. In these Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures, the Company has assessed the current impact of COVID-19 on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as the Company s estimates and accounting policies. The Company has made additional disclosures of these assessments, as necessary. 

long-lived assets. These estimates are based on historical information, current trends, and information available from other sources. The Company s results are affected by economic, political, legislative, regulatory and legal actions. Economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, interest and monetary exchange rates, government fiscal policies, government policies surrounding the containment of COVID-19 and changes in the prices of raw materials, can have a significant effect on operations. These factors and other events could cause actual results to differ from management's estimates. 
 
 million in short-term investments. As of August 27, 2022 , the Company had short-term investments. 

of the Company s revenues are derived from fees for route servicing of Core Laundry Operations, Specialty Garments and First Aid services performed by the Company s employees at the customer s location of business. Revenues from the Company s route servicing customer contracts represent a single-performance obligation. The Company recognizes these revenues over time as services are performed based on the nature of services provided and contractual rates (input method). Certain of the Company s customer contracts, primarily within the Company s Core Laundry Operations, include pricing terms and conditions that include components of variable consideration. The variable consideration is typically in the form of consideration due to a customer based on performance metrics specified within the contract. Specifically, some contracts contain discounts or rebates that the customer can earn through the achievement of specified volume levels. Each component of variable consideration is earned based on the Company s actual performance during the measurement period specified within the contract. To determine the transaction price, the Company estimates the variable consideration using the most likely amount method, based on the specific contract provisions and known performance results during the relevant measurement period. When determining if variable consideration should be constrained, the Company considers whether factors outside its control could result in a significant reversal of revenue. In making these assessments, the Company considers the likelihood and magnitude of a potential reversal. The Company s performance period generally corresponds with the monthly invoice period. No significant constraints on the Company s revenue recognition were applied during fiscal 2023. The Company reassesses these estimates during each reporting period. The Company maintains a liability for these discounts and rebates within accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Variable consideration also includes consideration paid to a customer at the beginning of a contract. The Company capitalizes this consideration and amortizes it over the life of the contract as a reduction to revenue in accordance with the accounting guidance for revenue recognition. These assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of August 26, 2023, definite-lived intangible assets have a weighted average useful life of approximately years. Customer contracts have a weighted average useful life of approximately years and other intangible assets, net, which consist of primarily of restrictive covenants, software and trademarks, have a weighted average useful life of approximately years. 
 to over periods ranging from three to . The estimated current costs, net of legal settlements with insurance carriers, have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at per year. Changes in enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, management s estimates of costs, risk-free interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, the input of the Company s attorneys and outside consultants or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for environmental and other contingent liabilities. Refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies , of these Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion and analysis. 
 . The estimated liability has been based on historical experience in decommissioning nuclear laundry facilities, estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, external vendor estimates as to the cost to decommission these assets in the future, and federal and state regulatory requirements. The estimated current costs have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at per year. The liability has been discounted using credit-adjusted risk-free rates that range from approximately to . Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the Company s estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, estimated dates of decommissioning, changes in decommissioning costs, changes in federal or state regulatory guidance on the decommissioning of such facilities, or other changes in estimates. Changes due to revised estimates are recognized by adjusting the carrying amount of the liability and the related long-lived asset if the assets are still in service, or charged to expense in the period if the assets are no longer in service.

 after the grant date. Accordingly, compensation expense related to these Share-Based Awards in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was recognized on the date of grant. For performance-based restricted stock unit awards with revenue and profitability performance criteria, we evaluate the probability of meeting the performance criteria at each balance sheet date and, if probable, related compensation cost is amortized over the performance period on a straight-line basis because such awards vest only at the end of the measurement period. Changes to the probability assessment and the estimate of shares expected to vest will result in adjustments to the related share-based compensation expense that will be recorded in the period of the change. If the performance targets are not achieved, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. U.S. GAAP requires that share-based compensation cost be measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and be recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Determining the fair value of Share-Based Awards in the form of stock appreciation rights at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends and share price volatility. The fair value of each Share-Based Award in the form of stock appreciation rights is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes compensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants over the related vesting period. The fair value for each restricted stock, unrestricted stock and restricted stock unit grant is determined by using the closing price of the Company s stock on the date of the grant. Refer to Note 12, Share-Based Compensation , of these Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Company s share-based compensation plans.

, the Company completed the acquisition of the business and certain real estate assets of Clean Uniform Clean from Clean Holdco, Inc. and certain of its affiliates for an aggregate purchase price of million, net of cash acquired. The difference between the cash paid and the total purchase price of million represents amounts owed from the seller as a result of final closing adjustments. The acquisition was structured primarily as a stock purchase but will be treated as an asset purchase from a tax perspective, which will allow for a step-up in the tax basis of the assets and provide incremental tax benefits expected to be realized over time with an estimated value of approximately million. Clean is a uniform, workwear and facility service program provider with 11 locations covering Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas, Kansas and Oklahoma. Prior to the closing of the acquisition, neither the Company nor any of its affiliates, or any director or officer of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any associate of any such director or officer, had any material relationship with any of the sellers. The results of operations from Clean are included in the Company's results under the Core Laundry Operations segment subsequent to the acquisition date of March 13, 2023. The Company paid for the acquisition of Clean with cash on hand and borrowings under the Credit Agreement (defined below). The Clean acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The Company has prepared purchase price allocations for the business combination with Clean on a preliminary basis. Changes to those allocations may occur as additional information becomes available during the respective measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The Company is in the process of measuring the fair value of its tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company has engaged specialists to assist in the valuation of intangible assets for which certain assumptions have not yet been finalized. The amounts assigned to intangible assets acquired were based on their respective fair values determined as of the acquisition date. The table below summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the purchase price over the net assets recognized and represents the estimated future economic benefits arising from expected synergies and growth opportunities for the Company. All of the goodwill and intangible assets were allocated to the Core Laundry Operations segment and are deductible for tax purposes. Transaction and related costs, consisting primarily of professional fees, directly related to the acquisition, totaled approximately million during fiscal 2023. All transaction and related costs were expensed as incurred and are included in selling and administrative expenses. The amount of revenue of Clean included in the consolidated statements of income from the acquisition date of March 13, 2023 to August 26, 2023 was million.

The Company s cash equivalents listed above represent money market securities and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. The Company does not adjust the quoted market price for such financial instruments. The Company's short-term investments listed above represent certificates of deposit, which maturities range up to six months at purchase. Such securities are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost, which approximates market value. As such, the Company's short-term investments are included within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company s pension plan assets listed above represent guaranteed deposit accounts that are maintained and operated by a third-party investment manager. At the beginning of each calendar year, the third-party investment manager notifies the Company of the annual rates of interest which will be applied to the amounts held in the guaranteed deposit account during the next calendar year. In determining the interest rate to be applied, the third-party investment manager considers the investment performance of the underlying assets of the prior year; however, regardless of the investment performance the annual interest rate applied per the contract must be a minimum of . As such, the Company s pension plan assets are included within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 7, Employee Benefit Plans , of these Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Company s pension plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. The Company s foreign currency forward contracts represent contracts the Company has entered into to exchange Canadian dollars for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage its exposure related to certain forecasted Canadian dollar denominated sales of one of its subsidiaries. These contracts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other long-term assets as of August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022 . The fair value of the forward contracts is based on similar exchange traded derivatives and are, therefore, included within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized. Foreign tax effect As of August 26, 2023, unremitted foreign earnings, have been retained by the Company s foreign subsidiaries for indefinite reinvestment. If the Company were to repatriate those earnings, in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company could be subject to immaterial withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Uncertain tax positions As of August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022 , there was million and million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits, of which million and million, respectively, would favorably impact the Company s effective tax rate, if recognized. The Company recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods. As of August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022, the Company had accrued a nominal amount in interest and penalties, in its long-term accrued liabilities. For fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized a nominal expense in its Consolidated Statements of Income related to interest and penalties.

The Company has a significant portion of its operations in the U.S. and Canada. It is required to file federal income tax returns as well as state income tax returns in a majority of the U.S. states and also in a number of Canadian provinces. At times, the Company is subject to audits in these jurisdictions, which typically are complex and can require several years to resolve. The final resolution of any such tax audits could result in either a reduction in the Company s accruals or an increase in its income tax provision, both of which could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations in any given period. All U.S. and Canadian federal income tax statutes have lapsed for filings up to and including fiscal years 2017 and 2015, respectively. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations for periods prior to fiscal 2018. The Company is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly in the next 12 months. 

 million unsecured revolving credit agreement (as subsequently amended, the Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks, which matures on . Under the Credit Agreement, the Company was able to borrow funds at variable interest rates based on, at the Company s election, the Eurodollar rate or a base rate, plus in each case a spread based on the Company s consolidated funded debt ratio. On March 9, 2023, the Company exercised the accordion feature of the Credit Agreement pursuant to an amendment to the Credit Agreement. The exercise of the accordion feature increases the aggregate commitments under the Credit Agreement by million, for a total aggregate commitment of up to million. In addition, the amendment provides for the replacement of LIBOR with SOFR such that borrowings are based on, at the Company s election, the SOFR rate or a base rate, plus in each case a spread based on the Company s consolidated funded debt ratio. The amendment also refreshed the accordion feature, so that, provided there is no default or event of default under the Credit Agreement and the Company is in compliance with its financial covenants on a pro forma basis, the Company may request an increase in the aggregate commitments under the Credit Agreement (in the form of revolving or term tranches) of up to an additional million, for a total aggregate commitment of up to million. Availability of credit requires compliance with certain financial and other covenants, including a maximum consolidated funded debt ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company evaluates its compliance with these financial covenants on a fiscal quarterly basis. As of August 26, 2023, the interest rates applicable to the Company s borrowings under the Credit Agreement would be calculated as SOFR plus at the time of the respective borrowing. During the third fiscal quarter of 2023, the Company borrowed million under its Credit Agreement to finance the acquisition of Clean and fund its day-to-day operations. All amounts were repaid during the third quarter and the Company had outstanding borrowings as of August 26, 2023. As of August 26, 2023, the Company had outstanding letters of credit amounting to million , leaving million available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement. As of August 26, 2023 , the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. 

 forward contracts to exchange CAD for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage its exposure related to certain forecasted CAD denominated sales of one of its subsidiaries. The hedged transactions are specified as the first amount of CAD denominated revenues invoiced by one of the Company s domestic subsidiaries each fiscal quarter, beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 and continuing through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2026. In total, the Company will sell approximately million CAD at an average Canadian-dollar exchange rate of over these quarterly periods. The Company concluded that the forward contracts met the criteria to qualify as a cash flow hedge under U.S. GAAP. As of August 26, 2023, the Company had forward contracts with a notional value of approximately million CAD outstanding and recorded the fair value of the contracts of million in prepaid expenses and other current assets with a corresponding gain of million in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which was recorded net of tax. For the fiscal 2023, the Company reclassified million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to revenue, related to the derivative financial instruments. The gain on these forward contracts that results in a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss as of August 26, 2023 is expected to be reclassified to revenues prior to their maturity on August 29, 2026.

Pension Plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan The Company accounts for its pension plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan on an accrual basis over employees estimated service periods. The Company maintains an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP for certain eligible employees of the Company. The benefits are based on the employee s compensation upon retirement. The amount charged to expense related to this plan amounted to approximately million , million and million for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company maintains a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan UniFirst Plan covering employees at one of its locations. The benefits are based on years of service. The UniFirst Plan assets are invested in a Guaranteed Deposit Account GDA that is maintained and operated by a third-party investment manager. The amount charged to expense related to this plan amounted to approximately million , million and million for fiscal 2023 fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.

. The Company recognized as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission its nuclear laundry facilities. The estimated liability is based on historical experience in decommissioning nuclear laundry facilities, estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, external vendor estimates as to the cost to decommission these assets in the future, and federal and state regulatory requirements. The estimated current costs have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at per year. The liability has been discounted using credit-adjusted risk-free rates that range from approximately to . Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the Company s estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, estimated dates of decommissioning, changes in decommissioning costs, changes in federal or state regulatory guidance on the decommissioning of such facilities, or other changes in estimates. Changes due to revised estimates are recognized by adjusting the carrying amount of the liability and the related long-lived asset if the assets are still in service, or charged to expense in the period if the assets are no longer in service.

Environmental and Legal Contingencies The Company and its operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other substances. In particular, industrial laundries currently use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues, and, in the past, used perchloroethylene and other dry-cleaning solvents. The Company is attentive to the environmental concerns surrounding the disposal of these materials and has, through the years, taken measures to avoid their improper disposal. The Company has settled, or contributed to the settlement of, past actions or claims brought against the Company relating to the disposal of hazardous materials at several sites and there can be no assurance that the Company will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future. U.S. GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. The Company regularly consults with attorneys and outside consultants in its consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances before recording a contingent liability. Changes in enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, management s estimates of costs, risk-free interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, the input of the Company s attorneys and outside consultants or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for environmental and other contingent liabilities. Under environmental laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on, or in, or emanating from, such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of, or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. There can be no assurances that acquired or leased locations have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon the Company under such laws or expose the Company to third-party actions such as tort suits. The Company continues to address environmental conditions under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise with respect to certain sites. The Company has accrued certain costs related to certain sites, including but not limited to, sites in Woburn and Somerville, Massachusetts, as it has been determined that the costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company, together with multiple other companies, are party to a consent decree related to the Company's property and the Central Area in Woburn, Massachusetts. The EPA has provided the Company and other signatories to the consent decree with comments on the design and implementation of groundwater and soil remedies at the Woburn site and investigation of environmental conditions in the Central Area. The consent decree does not address any remediation work that may be required in the Central Area. The Company, and other signatories, has implemented and proposed to do additional work at the Woburn site but many of the EPA s comments remain to be resolved. The Company has accrued costs to perform certain work responsive to the EPA s comments. Additionally, the Company has implemented mitigation measures and continue to monitor environmental conditions at a site in Somerville, Massachusetts. The Company has agreed to undertake additional actions responsive to a notice of audit findings from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection concerning a regulatory submittal that the Company made in 2009 for a portion of the site. The Company has received demands from the local transit authority for reimbursement of certain costs associated with its construction of a new municipal transit station in the area of the Somerville site. This station is part of an ongoing extension of the transit system. The Company has reserved for costs in connection with this matter; however, in light of the uncertainties associated with this matter, these costs and the related reserve may change. The Company routinely reviews and evaluates sites that may require remediation and monitoring and determines its estimated costs based on various estimates and assumptions. These estimates are developed using its internal sources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: Management s judgment and experience in remediating and monitoring the Company s sites; 

 Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation and monitoring; 

 The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other potentially responsible parties PRPs who may be liable for remediation and monitoring of a specific site; and 

 The typical allocation of costs among PRPs. 

 There is usually a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with each site. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company s accruals reflect the amount within the range that it believes is the best estimate or the low end of a range of estimates if no point within the range is a better estimate. Where it believes that both the amount of a particular liability and the timing of the payments are reliably determinable, the Company adjusts the cost in current dollars using a rate of for inflation until the time of expected payment and discounts the cost to present value using current risk-free interest rates. As of August 26, 2023, the risk-free interest rates utilized by the Company ranged from to . For environmental liabilities that have been discounted, the Company includes interest accretion, based on the effective interest method, in selling and administrative expenses on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

Balance as of August 26, 2023 

Estimated insurance proceeds are primarily received from an annuity received as part of a legal settlement with an insurance company. Annual proceeds of approximately million are deposited into an escrow account which funds remediation and monitoring costs for sites related to former operations. Annual proceeds received but not expended in the current year accumulate in this account and may be used in future years for costs related to this site through the year 2027. As of August 26, 2023, the balance in this escrow account, which is held in a trust and is not recorded in the Company s accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet, was approximately million . Also included in estimated insurance proceeds are amounts the Company is entitled to receive pursuant to legal settlements as reimbursements from insurance companies for estimated costs at one of its sites. The Company s nuclear garment decontamination facilities are licensed by respective state agencies, as delegated authority by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the NRC pursuant to the NRC s Agreement State program and are subject to applicable federal and state radioactive material regulations. In addition, the Company s international locations (Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union) are regulated by equivalent respective jurisdictional authorities. There can be no assurance that such regulation will not lead to material disruptions in the Company s garment decontamination business. From time to time, the Company is also subject to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of its business operations, including personal injury claims, customer contract matters, employment claims and environmental matters as described above. In addition, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Mexican federal tax authority issued a tax assessment on the Company s subsidiary in Mexico for fiscal 2016 import taxes, value added taxes and custom processing fees of over million, plus surcharges, fines and penalties of million for a total assessment of million, which accrues interest and other charges. The Company disagrees with such tax assessment and is challenging the validity of the tax assessment through an appeal process. While the Company is unable to ascertain the ultimate outcome of this matter, based on the information currently available, the Company believes that a loss with respect to this matter is neither probable nor remote. Given the uncertainty associated with the ultimate resolution of this matter, the Company is unable to reasonably assess an estimate or range of estimates of any potential losses. While it is impossible for the Company to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to contingent liabilities, including lawsuits and environmental contingencies, the Company believes that the aggregate amount of such liabilities, if any, in excess of amounts covered by insurance have been properly accrued in accordance with U.S. GAAP. It is possible, however, that the future financial position and/or results of operations for any particular future period could be materially affected by changes in the Company s assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies or changes out of the Company s control. Other Contingent Liabilities As security for certain agreements with the NRC and various state agencies related to the nuclear operations (see above) and certain insurance programs, the Company had standby irrevocable bank commercial letters of credit of million and million outstanding as of August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022, respectively. Non-cancellable purchase commitments for inventories, software, and services amounted to million as of August 26, 2023, of which million will be paid in less than 1 year, million will be paid in 1 to 3 years, and the remaining will be paid in 3 to 5 years.

The 2010 Plan permits the award of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, unrestricted stock and performance shares (collectively referred to as Share-Based Awards as well as dividend equivalent rights and cash-based awards. On October 27, 2014, the Board of Directors, subject to the approval of the Company s shareholders, which was received at the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders, adopted an amendment to the 2010 Plan to, among other matters, reserve for issuance an additional shares and extend to 2025 the time period awards may be granted under the 2010 Plan. As of August 26, 2023, the number of remaining shares available for future grants under the 2010 Plan was . Share-based compensation expense, which includes expense related to Share-Based Awards, has been recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income in selling and administrative expenses. All Share-Based Awards issued to management were recommended to the Board of Directors by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board of Directors.

Accordingly, compensation expense related to the stock appreciation rights was recognized on the date of grant. As of August 26, 2023, the total compensation cost not yet recognized related to non-vested Share-Based Awards was approximately million . The weighted average period over which compensation cost for Share-Based Awards will be recognized is years. All stock appreciation rights issued to employees were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company s Common Stock on the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights generally vest on each anniversary of the grant date over a period and expire after the grant date. Share-Based Awards granted to the Company s non-employee Directors were fully vested as of the date of grant. Non-employee Director Share-Based Award grants in the form of stock appreciation rights expire on the earlier of the eighth anniversary of the grant date or the second anniversary of the date that the Director ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors. Time-based restricted stock units granted to employees vest on each anniversary of the grant date over a period. Generally, performance-based restricted stock units granted to employees are earned based on whether and the extent to which the Company achieves certai n profitability targets.

operating segments based on the information reviewed by its chief executive officer: U.S. Rental and Cleaning, Canadian Rental and Cleaning, MFG, Specialty Garments, First Aid and Corporate. The U.S. Rental and Cleaning and Canadian Rental and Cleaning operating segments have been combined to form the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment, and as a result, the Company has reporting segments. The U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment purchases, rents, cleans, delivers and sells, uniforms and protective clothing and non-garment items in the U.S. and Canada. The laundry locations of the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment are referred to by the Company as industrial laundries or industrial laundry locations. The MFG operating segment designs and manufactures uniforms and non-garment items primarily for the purpose of providing these goods to the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. MFG revenues are primarily generated when goods are shipped from the Company s manufacturing facilities, or its subcontract manufacturers, to other Company locations. These intercompany revenues are recorded at a transfer price which is typically in excess of the actual manufacturing cost. Manufactured products are carried in inventory until placed in service at which time they are amortized at this transfer price. On a consolidated basis, intercompany revenues and income are eliminated and the carrying value of inventories and rental merchandise in service is reduced to the manufacturing cost. Income before income taxes from MFG net of the intercompany MFG elimination offsets the merchandise amortization costs incurred by the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment as the merchandise costs of this reporting segment are amortized and recognized based on inventories purchased from MFG at the transfer price which is above the Company s manufacturing cost. The Corporate operating segment consists of costs associated with the Company s distribution center, sales and marketing, information systems, engineering, procurement, supply chain, accounting and finance, human resources, other general and administrative costs and interest expense. The revenues generated from the Corporate operating segment represent certain direct sales made by the Company directly from its distribution center. The products sold by this operating segment are the same products rented and sold by the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. In the table below, no assets or capital expenditures are presented for the Corporate operating segment because no assets are allocated to this operating segment in the information reviewed by the chief executive officer. However, depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets are reflected in income from operations and income before income taxes for the Corporate operating segment. The assets that give rise to this depreciation and amortization are included in the total assets of the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment as this is how they are tracked and reviewed by the Company. The majority of expenses accounted for within the Corporate segment relate to costs of the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning segment, with the remainder of the costs relating to the Specialty Garment and First Aid segments. The Specialty Garments operating segment purchases, rents, cleans, delivers and sells, specialty garments and non-garment items primarily for nuclear and cleanroom applications and provides cleanroom cleaning services at certain customer locations. The First Aid operating segment sells first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies, provides certain safety training and maintains wholesale distribution and pill packaging operations.

Report of Independent Regist ered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of UniFirst Corporation 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UniFirst Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company as of August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 26, 2023, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 26, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 26, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated October 25, 2023 expressed an adverse opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Self-Insurance Accruals 

Description of the Matter 
 
 As of August 26, 2023, the Company had recognized current and long-term insurance related liabilities of 34.3 million and 64.8 million, respectively. As discussed in Note 1 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the Company is self-insured for certain obligations related to health, workers compensation, vehicles and general liability programs and judgments and estimates are used by the Company in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for events that have occurred but have not been reported. 

Auditing management s estimate of the portion of the insurance related liabilities related to workers compensation, vehicles and general liability is highly judgmental and complex due to the significant uncertainty in the potential value of reported claims and the number and potential value of incurred but not reported claims and the application of significant management judgment in making those estimates. The reserve estimate is sensitive to assumptions used to estimate the ultimate liability for reported claims and to estimate the value of claims that have been incurred but have not been reported. 

69 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s self-insurance accrual process. This includes controls over the assumptions and methods used to establish the estimate. Specifically, we tested controls related to management s review of claims data, significant inputs to the accrual calculation, and the related reconciliations. To test the self-insurance accrual, our procedures included, among others, testing of the significant inputs used in management s analysis, performing transactional testing over the completeness and accuracy of claims data and vouching payments made to third parties. Furthermore, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in evaluating the key assumptions and methodologies used by management to determine the reserve. We then compared the Company s reserve amount to a range which our actuarial specialist developed based on independently selected assumptions. 

Environmental Contingencies 

Description of the Matter 
 
 As discussed in Note 11 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other substances. As of August 26, 2023, the Company had recorded current and long-term liabilities of 13.8 million and 16.2 million, respectively, representing its best estimate of losses related to these environmental matters. Auditing management s accounting for environmental loss contingencies was especially challenging, as significant judgment is required by the Company to evaluate whether it is probable that an environmental loss contingency has been incurred and to estimate the future costs to remediate the environmental matters. These judgments include management s identification of sites with potential liabilities, management s estimate of the amount and timing of remediation and other costs, allocation of costs among other potentially responsible parties, changes to enacted laws and regulation, discount rates, and evaluation of information available from regulatory agencies. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s identification and measurement of the environmental loss contingency. For example, we tested controls over management s review of the environmental loss contingency calculation and management s meetings where they evaluate key judgments and estimates affecting the environmental loss contingency, including those outlined in the paragraph above. To test the assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss assumption and whether the loss was reasonably estimable, our procedures included, among others, inspecting correspondence to and from regulatory agencies, obtaining legal counsel confirmation letters, meeting with the Company s legal counsel and other members of management to discuss environmental matters, inspecting environmental studies, reading the minutes of the meetings of the Company s Board of Directors and committees of the Company s Board of Directors, and obtaining a representation letter from the Company. Additionally, we involved our environmental specialists to perform a search for unrecorded environmental liabilities related to the Company s sites to look for new or contrary evidence. To test the measurement of the environmental liabilities, we performed detailed testing over costs incurred, and based on these historical trends and input from management, we evaluated the reasonableness of estimated costs to be incurred. We tested the allocation of costs among potentially responsible parties by analyzing allocation settlement agreements and tested other assumptions impacting the estimate such as inflation and discount rates by agreeing to third party sources. We also evaluated the accuracy of any changes in measurement of the liability through comparison with historical data. 

Evaluation of acquisition-date fair value of the customer contracts intangible asset 

Description of the Matter 
 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, on March 13, 2023, the Company acquired Clean Uniform Clean in a business combination for total cash consideration of 299.1 million. As an element of the transaction, the Company acquired a customer contracts intangible asset with an acquisition-date fair value of 65.7 million. 

70 

Auditing the Company s accounting for the acquisition of Clean was complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation uncertainty in determining the fair value of the identified customer contracts intangible asset. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair value estimates to underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the identified customer contracts intangible asset included revenue growth rates, discount rates, and projected gross and EBITDA margins. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the recognition and measurement of assets acquired. Specifically, we tested controls over management s review of the valuation of the customer contracts intangible asset, including the review of the valuation model and the significant assumptions described above that were used in the valuation. To test the estimated fair value of the acquired customer contracts intangible asset, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodologies used, evaluating the significant assumptions used in the valuation model and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in testing certain significant assumptions and methodologies used to value the acquired customer contracts intangible asset. For example, we compared the significant assumptions to current industry, market and economic trends as well as guideline companies within the same industry. In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value of the customer contracts intangible asset that would result from the changes in assumptions.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, solely as a result of the material weakness identified by management and described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that material information relating to the Company required to be disclosed by the Company in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures. We continue to review our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the material weakness identified by management and described below, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 26, 2023 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Management s Responsibility for Financial Statements 
 Our management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Those Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing those Consolidated Financial Statements, management was required to make certain estimates and judgments, which are based upon currently available information and management s view of current conditions and circumstances. 
 The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, which consists solely of independent directors, oversees our process of reporting financial information and the audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Audit Committee stays informed of our financial condition and regularly reviews management s financial policies and procedures, the independence of our independent auditors, our internal control over financial reporting and the objectivity of our financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm has full access to the Audit Committee and meets with the Audit Committee periodically, both with and without management present. 
 We have retained Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit our Consolidated Financial Statements found in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 26, 2023. We have made available to Ernst Young LLP all of our financial records and related data in connection with their audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management s Report on Internal C ontrol Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 26, 2023. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Management concluded that based on its assessment, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of August 26, 2023. The audited consolidated financial statements of the Company include the results of Clean Uniform, which we acquired in March 2023. As permitted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, we excluded this acquisition from our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of August 26, 2023 since it was not practical for management to conduct an assessment of internal control over financial reporting for Clean Uniform between the acquisition date and the date of management s assessment. Excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of August 26, 2023 were approximately 2 of total assets and approximately 2 of revenues, attributed to Clean Uniform, for the fiscal year ended August 26, 2023. 
 Material Weakness 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022, we previously identified a material weakness related to our revenue and accounts receivable process caused principally by ineffective information technology general controls ITGCs in the area of user access over the CRM system that we are in the process of deploying. This issue was attributable to numerous role security defects that we experienced in the application and uncertainty that additional role security defects would not arise. While we worked during fiscal 2023 to remediate the previously identified material weakness, we were unable to fully remediate the material weakness prior to the end of fiscal 2023. The material weakness as of the end of fiscal 2023 includes deficiencies in our manage change and manage access processes that were not designed and operating effectively as of date of our assessment. These deficiencies relate to our CRM system that we are in the process of deploying and affect revenue and receivables as well as a group of legacy applications which affect revenue and receivables, supply inventory and merchandise in service. Our business process controls within the revenue and accounts receivable process and inventory and merchandise in service process, both automated and manual, that are dependent on the completeness and accuracy of the information derived from the affected IT system were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. 
 Our independent registered accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 26, 2023, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Following identification of the material weakness and prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed substantive procedures for the year ended August 26, 2023 over our revenue, accounts receivable, supply inventory and merchandise in service. Based on these procedures, management believes that our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have certified in certifications furnished with this Annual Report on Form 10-K that, to the best of their knowledge, the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Ernst Young LLP has issued an unqualified opinion on our financial statements, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Remediation 
 Our management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. In response to the material weakness above, management is continuing to take actions to remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. 
 73 

The intended remediation actions include: (i) creating and filling an IT Compliance Oversight function, (ii) remediating the known issues that were identified in the areas of manage change and manage access, (iii) performing a more comprehensive review of current user access and our ITGCs, including the applicable monitoring controls, (iv) developing enhanced procedures and controls related to changes in IT systems, (v) developing and implementing additional training and awareness programs addressing ITGCs and policies, including educating control owners concerning the principles and requirements of each control, with a focus on user access, and (vi) increasing the extent of oversight and verification included in the operation of user access controls and processes. 
 We believe that these actions, when fully implemented, will remediate the material weakness, however, as we continue to evaluate and improve the applicable controls, management may determine that additional remediation measures are required. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Management is committed to successfully remediating the material weakness as promptly as possible.

Report of Independent Regist ered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of UniFirst Corporation 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited UniFirst Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of August 26, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, UniFirst Corporation (and subsidiaries) (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 26, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. 
 As indicated in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management s assessment and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Clean Uniform, which is included in the fiscal 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 2 of total assets as of August 26, 2023 and 2 of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Clean Uniform. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management s assessment. Management has identified a material weakness in controls related to the Company s revenue, accounts receivable, and inventory processes. The material weakness is the result of the aggregate effect of: (i) ineffective information technology (IT) controls over user access and change management related to the IT systems that support the revenue, accounts receivable, and inventory processes and (ii) design and operating deficiencies for certain transaction level controls within the revenue and accounts receivable process. As a result of the ineffective IT controls, process level automated controls and manual controls that are dependent on the completeness and accuracy of information derived from the affected IT systems could have been adversely impacted. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of UniFirst Corporation as of August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 26, 2023, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) of the Company. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the fiscal 2023 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated October 25, 2023, which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 75 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
