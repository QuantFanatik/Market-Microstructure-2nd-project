These forward-looking statements include information about possible or assumed future results of our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans and objectives. When we use the words believe , expect , anticipate , estimate , intend , should , may , plans , projects , will , or similar expressions, or the negative of these words, we intend to identify forward-looking statements. Statements regarding the following subjects are forward-looking by their nature: Although Registrant believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: general economic and business conditions, which will, among other things, affect demand for housing, the availability of prospective buyers; adverse changes in Registrant's real estate and construction market; including, among other things, competition with other manufacturers, risks of real estate development and acquisitions; governmental actions and initiatives; and environmental/safety requirements. ITEM 1. BUSINESS Our Company Overview Auscrete Corporation was formed as an enterprise to take advantage of technologies developed for the construction of affordable, thermally efficient and structurally superior commercial structures and residential housing. This "GREEN" product is the culmination of design and development since the early 1980's and is the result of the amalgamation of various material developments, taking an idea to a product and further developing that product to address an ongoing problem in the world's largest consumer marketplace, the quest for affordable, efficient and enduring housing. Auscrete's structures are monetarily highly competitive. A turnkey house, ready to move in sells for around 110- 120 per square foot. That is very competitive in today's market but is brought about by Auscrete's ability to manufacture large building products in mass production format. Each house is constructed on site and this produces an attractive site-built home, a durable home that will combat all kinds of adverse weather and age conditions. It will not burn, is not affected by termites or rot, its thermal efficiency saves extensively on energy costs, has extreme longevity and has very low maintenance needs. Founder's Development Activities to Date Auscrete's CEO and founder, John Sprovieri, possessed certain proprietary technology in lighter-weight concrete manufacturing that has been acquired by the corporation. He has applied his engineering and marketing expertise to develop and promote products under the product name, Auscretehomes and Auscrete. These products are the culmination of the refinements made to a technology developed in Australia in the mid 1980's. The Australian product has been used in many parts of the world in construction, and Mr. Sprovieri has further developed it in the US by creating a highly thermally efficient building system. The process enables infusion of millions of tiny air bubbles and EPS insulation into a special inert concrete mix enabling the creation of an insulated and lightweight product without sacrificing strength or structural integrity. Since commencing re-development of the basic technology almost thirteen years ago, Mr. Sprovieri has refined and modified the basic insulating formula that involves a number of purpose-built machines that have been fabricated for the manufacturing of Auscrete s product. The process includes machinery that can produce and infuse various sized aggregates, product specific hydraulically operated casting beds, concrete batching plant, materials handling equipment, specialized finishing machines and a "Hot Box" materials thermal testing station that gives thermal "R" ratings of materials to ASTM specifications. Additionally, many sample panels were produced for testing and for the construction of structures. At the outset and putting the Company s technology to practical use, Auscrete Corporation has produced many and varied housing and commercial buildings. 3 Table of Contents Future Strategy Auscrete Corporation intends to position itself as a major supplier in the affordable housing market. Housing is generally considered "affordable" when its cost does not exceed 30 percent of the median family income in a given area. In many parts of the country, housing costs have shown signs of adversely affecting workers, corporations and local economies. Yet still the availability of affordable housing is becoming increasingly scarce forcing large numbers of working families to live on the streets overwhelming Governmental services. The company is offering a product that not only makes housing affordable, but also offers some luxuries as well, such as standard heat pump/air conditioning that would not be available in other houses at such comparable pricing. By constructing using the Auscrete Building System, those luxuries will result in lower cost utilities and a comfortable 'feel' to the living environment, as can be achieved with a product offering excellent thermal and soundproofing qualities as well as superb fire resistance. Developers and contractors will offer the homes as complete, turnkey ready constructed site-built dwellings. Even though they are technologically advanced, they are just plain good value masonry homes built of a time proven product, concrete. Auscrete can economically deliver whole house panel sets throughout the entire West Coast and as far away as Texas or Alberta, Canada servicing a fast-emerging market in this above average, affordable housing growth area. The company plans on selling most of its output to developers, contractors and builders who will purchase the complete set of wall, roof and interior panels from Auscrete and use their own construction crews to construct and complete the houses. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Not required for smaller reporting companies. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. In 2019 the Company divested its ownership of a 5-acre Industrial Property in Goldendale WA repurposing the investment to capital used for major specialized plant equipment. In June of that year the Company moved its Manufacturing Plant operations into an 8,000 sq. ft. facility located in the outer Goldendale area. The Companies month-to-month facility total rental payments for 2022 were 24,000. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. The Company is not party to any material pending legal proceedings as described in Item 103 of Regulation S-K. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. Not Applicable. 4 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. The company s stock is listed on the OTCPINK under the symbol "ASCK". The company has not repurchased stock or declared or paid dividends on its capital stock in 2022. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA. Not required for smaller reporting companies. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Forward-Looking Statements All statements other than statements of historical fact included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve various important assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this discussion can be identified by words such as "anticipate," "believe," "could," "estimate," "expect," "plan," "intend," "may," "should" or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, performance or achievement. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to, competitive factors and pricing pressures, changes in legal and regulatory requirements, cancellation or deferral of customer orders, technological change or difficulties, difficulties in the timely development of new products, difficulties in manufacturing, commercialization and trade difficulties and general economic conditions as well as the factors set forth in our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report or the date of any document incorporated by reference, in this Annual Report. We are under no obligation, and expressly disclaim any obligation, to update or alter any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's financial statements have been presented on the basis that it will continue as a going concern. The Company has not generated revenues from construction related operations to date. The Company has an Accumulated deficit of 13,371,184 as of December 31, 2022, which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. To the extent that the Company's capital resources are not adequate to meet current and planned operating requirements, the Company will use additional funds through equity and debt financing, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners, licensees or others, and from other sources, which may have the effect of diluting the holdings of existing shareholders. The Company has subsequent current arrangements with respect to, or sources of, such additional financing and the Company does not anticipate that existing shareholders will be required to provide any portion of the Company's future financing requirements. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available when needed or that such financing will be available on terms Acceptable to the Company. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay or terminate expenditures for certain of its programs that it would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize. This would have a material adverse effect on the Company and raise doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 5 Table of Contents BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: The summary of significant accounting policies of Auscrete Corporation is presented to assist in the understanding of the Company's financial statements.

The main reason is the decrease in share-based expense from 0 in 2022 compared to 2,683,227 in 2021. The company's operational expenses during 2022 were involved in fund-raising, day to day operations, payroll, facility lease, utilities, compliance fees, equipment and materials purchases. 6 Table of Contents The company acquired access to investment funds which were to produce results in limited cash acquisitions throughout 2022 and 2021.

As there were no major asset purchases, therefore lower operational costs. At the time of filing the Company has fully implemented its planned start-up strategy which has now positioned itself in an operational state of production. The Company s specialized systems and major new equipment procurements have been integrated and installed into a fully operational batch plant and product manufacturing has commenced. The Company is at the stage of delivering full house sets as its next tactical step in securing self-sustaining revenue capital. 7 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We have had minimal operating activity since inception of the company in 2010. Our 2022 short-term obligations were covered by funding received from convertible notes with a total value of 288,000 issued in 2022. Net cash used in operating activities was 271,184 in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net cash used in operating activity of 359,297 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net cash used in investing activities was 0 in the year ended December 31, 2022. Net cash used in activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was (918). Net cash provided by financing activities was 282,376 in the year ended December 31, 2022. Net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2021 was 345,624. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had inadequate cash to operate its business at the current level for the next six months and to achieve its business goals. The success of our business plan during and beyond the next 6 months will be provided by additional loan financing and revenues of a minimum of 300,000. Financing Auscrete Corporation, a Wyoming public company was incorporated on December 31, 2009 and first became effective for an IPO with the SEC on August 16, 2012. It was established to finance an expansion of a current pilot facility operated by the founders in Rufus, OR. The IPO was not commenced and expired in February 2014. The company became Effective with a Registration Statement in December 2014 registering shareholder held shares for sale enabling re-application to FINRA for listing on the OTCPink. The company engaged the services of a registered broker-dealer and market maker, Glendale Securities, LLC, who subsequently applied with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Use of Funds Raised Through Financing Initial Stage One targeted funding was 1.2 million and the company, during 2018, had purchased 5 acres of land on the Goldendale Industrial Estate. Initially it cost 102,000, including fees, to purchase the land. In 2019 a change in Company strategy brought Management to make the decision to sell back its land investment and utilize the funds to establish an operational plant within a newly leased facility also in the Goldendale Washington area. During the fiscal year both land sale funds and additional capital raised were used for major production equipment purchases and to fabricate startup provisions within a newly plant facility. This Corporate profit orientated decision has provided greater advantageous results in assuring faster revenue generation. The balance was used for working capital and expenses including wages, marketing and other working capital and reserves. Marketing Principal marketing efforts are initially aimed at leveraging specific contacts and relationships that have developed over the last 12 years since the inception of the founders pilot plant. The company has interviewed and chosen an experienced real estate marketing agent who will bring with him a multitude of contacts and interested customer inquiries. The Company is actively placing itself in the position to be a major supplier in the smaller home market. The structures will be on average 100 to 600 square feet, and consist of a number of floor plans and varying interior options. These much-desired structures would support urban community transitioning efforts for houseless populations and builders seeking to construct these smaller homes on their properties. 8 Table of Contents Auscrete's product is also extremely suitable for the construction of commercial and industrial structures. Company marketing will also explore the commercial world for applications and it is believed that such construction will become a large part of the company's future direction. Financial Projections The typical midsized affordable home market consists of structures in the range of 1,100 - 3,000 sq. ft. These will sell to the contractor or developer for around 80K- 200K with the average being over 150,000. The Company plans on marketing its small 300 to 800 sq ft homes in the neighborhood of 40K- 100K on average. Obviously, the company will look to increase output to meet future demands and expects to do this through internal financing. Off-balance Sheet Arrangement We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. ITEM 7a. QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The company has no exposure at this time. 9 Table of Contents ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm PCAOB ID. . 11 Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 12 Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 13 Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity for the Period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 14 Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 15 Notes to Financial Statements 16 10 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Auscrete Corporation Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Auscrete Corporation the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has not yet generated sufficient revenues and has a significant accumulated deficit. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Accounting for Embedded Conversion Features on Notes Payable Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company has issued several notes payable during the year with conversion rates that are adjustable at a discounted rate to market prices. The terms allow for variable amounts of shares to be converted for a set dollar value; this and other factors require the embedded conversion feature to be bifurcated and evaluated at each reporting period. Calculations and accounting for the notes payable and embedded conversion features require management s judgments related to initial and subsequent recognition of the debt and related conversion features, use of a valuation model, and determination of appropriate inputs used in the selected valuation model. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to evaluating the Company s accounting for notes payable and related accounts included the following, among others: Performed confirmation procedures and evaluated relevance and reliability of management data. Assessed the completeness and accuracy of valuation data provided by Company by performing independent calculations based on the model and comparing the Company s results for reasonableness.
