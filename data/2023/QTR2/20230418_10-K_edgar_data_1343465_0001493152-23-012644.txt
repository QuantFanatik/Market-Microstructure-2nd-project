PART

Item
1. Business 

Company
Overview 

The
Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey on July 28, 2009, as Sun Pacific Power Corporation and together with
its subsidiaries, are referred to as the Company . On August 24, 2017, the Company entered into an Acquisition Agreement
with EXOlifestyle, Inc. whereby the Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of EXOlifestyle, Inc. The acquisition was accounted for
as a reverse merger, resulting in the Company being considered the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial
statements included the accounts of EXOlifestyle, Inc. since August 24, 2017. 

Utilizing
management s history in general contracting, coupled with our subject matter expertise and intellectual property IP knowledge
of solar panels and other leading-edge technologies, the Company is focused on building a Next
Generation green energy company. The Company offers competitively priced Next Generation solar panel and lighting
products by working closely with design, engineering, integration and installation firms in order to deliver turnkey solar and other
energy efficient solutions. We provide solar bus stops,
solar trashcans and street kiosks that utilize our unique advertising offerings that provide State and local municipalities
with costs efficient solutions. 

Our
green energy solutions can be customized to meet most enterprise and/or government mandated regulations and advanced system requirements.
Our portfolio of products and services allow our clients to select a solution that enables them to establish a viable standard product
offering that focuses on the goals of the client s entire organization. 

Currently,
the Company has four (4) subsidiary holdings. Sun Pacific Power Corp., which was the initial company that specialized in solar 
other renewable energy projects., The Company also formed National Mechanical Group Corp, a New Jersey corporation focused on holding
the Company s patents. The Company also formed Street Smart Outdoor Corp, a Wyoming corporation that acts as a holding company
for the Company s state specific operations in unique advertising through solar bus stops, solar trashcans and street kiosks. 
The Company also formed Elba Power Corp, an Alabama Corp for the development of a Solar Assembly company. Elba Power Corp has entered
into a property purchase contract for approximately 3 million, pending financing, and has obtained the approval for an inducement resolution
for 50 million dollars from the State of Alabama, along with a 100 tax abatement on sales and use tax in support of the development
of a solar assembly plant. Elba Power Corp is currently working with potential funders in support of the capitalization and development
of the project. 

Sun
Pacific Power Corp. has entered into an agreement with FoxEss, a global leader in the development
of inverter and energy storage solutions as a wholesale distributer for North and South America and Australia. Sun Pacific Power Corp.
has also entered into an agreement with a South Asian solar manufacturer to act as an original equipment manufacturer OEM for Sun Pacific Solar Panels and associated products. Sun Pacific Power Corp has also commenced in April 2023, a sales, marketing, and
affiliate program to market and install residential solar panels in various markets within the United States. 

As
of today, our principal source of revenues is derived from Street Smart Outdoor Corp. operations in the outdoor advertising business
with contracts in place in New Jersey and Florida. 

On
September 19, 2019, the United States Patent and Trademark Office published patent US 2019 288 139 A1 for the Frame-Less Encapsulated
Photo-Voltaic (PV) Solar Power Panel Supporting Solar Cell Modules Encapsulated Within Optically-Transparent Epoxy-Resin Material Coating
a Phenolic Resin Support Sheet issued to National Mechanical Group Corp. Originally designed for application in the solar bus shelters
operated by Street Smart Outdoor Corp, as a glassless solar panel, the Company has developed a patent protected product and process for
creating solar panels that can be integrated directly into the design of products as a molded, weather resistant plastic. The Company
began work developing a business plan for expanding on either manufacturing or licensing of the technology in 2020, with such work continuing
into 2023. 

Strategic
Vision 

Our
objective is to grow our business as a premier green energy-based provider of both product and services to the public and private sectors.
We are working to deploy our strategy in building upon our green energy expertise in conjunction with our intellectual property and subject
matter expertise that may allow us to grow a group of business lines in solar and other unique energy related areas. 

Recent
advances in a multitude of different yet converging technologies have significantly improved the ability to integrate energy efficient
products and solutions into infrastructure related projects. These technological advances decrease the requirements needed to jointly
operate a multitude of differing assets, devices, and tools that create new ways to integrate evolving new technologies. This technological
change and convergence in energy efficient devices, integrated communications among devices, and societal needs to more effectively and
environmentally friendly we believe presents a significant opportunity for us in providing and supporting simple to complex integrated
solutions. 

Our
challenges continue to be reaching critical mass in our solar shelter business, expanding into other green energy related projects, and
securing operational capital. While the Company has never been adequately funded from inception, the Company has attempted to use debt,
equity, and other opportunistic in-kind compensation to further the Company s strategic vision. 

4 

Going
Concern 

The
Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately 8.0 million and a working capital deficit of approximately 3.1 million as of December
31, 2022. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations
to meet its obligations and/or obtain additional financing from its stockholders and/or other third parties. 

In
order to further implement its business plan and satisfy its working capital requirements, the Company will need to raise additional
capital. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise additional equity or debt financing at acceptable terms, if at
all. 

There
is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that
may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Competition

Our
competitive market is made up of a variety of small to large company s depending upon the area that we are competing within. In
the solar and advertising shelter marketplace it is made up of a smaller amount of direct competitors including JC Decaux, Lamar, Clear
Chanel, Signal Outdoor, and various others. We believe the Shelter marketplace and the new areas in other green energy marketplace may
be subject to more technological change. Given this we believe that the major competitive factors in our marketplace are distinctive
technical competencies, governmental certifications and approvals to operate within this space, successful past contract performance,
price of services, reputation for quality, and key management personnel with domain expertise. 

Marketing
and Sales 

We
currently engage in a limited amount of marketing activities related to request for proposals for projects related to government contracts
and or other contracting activities with commercial and private entities. We are developing a variety of new marketing activities designed
to broaden our market awareness of our products, services and solutions, that may include e-mail and direct mail campaigns, co-marketing
strategies designed to leverage developing strategic relationships, website marketing, topical webcasts, public relations campaigns,
speaking engagements and forums and industry analyst visibility initiatives. We plan to participate in and sponsor conferences that cater
to our target market and demonstrate and promote our products, services and solutions at trade shows targeted to green energy companies
and executives. We also plan to publish white papers relating to green energy projects and develop customer reference programs, such
as customer case studies, in an effort to promote better awareness of industry issues and demonstrate that our solutions can address
many of the benefits of our solutions. 

Our
marketing strategy is to build our brand and increase market awareness of our products, services, and solutions in our target markets
and to generate qualified sales leads that will allow us to successfully build strong relationships with key decision makers. We plan
to use partnerships and other business arrangements to augment our marketing and sales reach in both our outdoor advertising, construction,
and waste to energy business. 

Clients

Our
client base is presently made up predominately of U.S. based national advertisers. Historically, we have derived, and may continue to
derive in the future, a significant percentage of our total revenues from a relatively small number of contracts. Due to the nature of
our business and the relative size of certain contracts, which are entered into in the ordinary course of business, the loss of any single
significant customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In future periods, we will continue to focus
on diversifying our revenue by increasing the number of our customer contracts and seeking out partnerships that will allow us to increase
our customer reach. 

5 

Intellectual
Property 

Our
intellectual property rights are important to our business. We believe we will come to rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark,
service mark, trade secret and other rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual
provisions to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. We will protect our intellectual property
rights in a number of ways including entering into confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, customers, consultants
and partners in an attempt to control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary technology and other information.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise
obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology. 

U.S.
patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing in the United
States the inventions covered by the claims of granted patents. Our patents, including our pending patents, if granted, may be contested,
circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights that may be granted in those issued and pending patents may not provide us with proprietary
protection or competitive advantages, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing those patents. Therefore, the exact
benefits of our issued patents and, if issued, our pending patents and the other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual
property cannot be predicted with certainty. 

On
September 19, 2019, the United States Patent and Trademark Office published patent US 2019 288 139 A1 for the Frame-Less Encapsulated
Photo-Voltaic (PV) Solar Power Panel Supporting Solar Cell Modules Encapsulated Within Optically-Transparent Epoxy-Resin Material Coating
a Phenolic Resin Support Sheet issued to National Mechanical Group Corp. Originally designed for application in the solar bus shelters
operated by Street Smart Outdoor Corp, as a glassless solar panel, the Company has developed a patent protected product and process for
creating solar panels that can be integrated directly into the design of products as a molded, weather resistant plastic. The Company
began work developing a business plan for expanding on either manufacturing or licensing of the technology in 2020, with such work continuing
into 2023. 

Seasonality

Our
business is not seasonal. However, our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter, due to revenues
earned on contracts, the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter; as well as the schedule of government
agencies awarding contracts, the term of each contract that we have been awarded and general economic conditions. Because a portion of
our expenses, such as personnel and facilities costs, are fixed in the short term, successful contract performance and variation in the
volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in
operating results from quarter to quarter. 

Employees

As
of December 31, 2022, we had 2 full-time employees. We periodically engage additional consultants and employ temporary or full-time employees
as needed. Potential employees possessing the unique qualifications required are readily available for both part-time and full-time employment.
The primary method of soliciting personnel is through recruiting resources directly utilizing all known sources including electronic
databases, public forums, and personal networks of friends and former co-workers. 

We
believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to offer market competitive compensation packages to attract
and retain highly skilled, highly motivated and disciplined managerial, technical, sales and support personnel. We generally do not have
employment contracts with our employees, but we do selectively maintain employment agreements with key employees. In addition, confidentiality
and non-disclosure agreements are in place with many of our customer, employees and consultants and such agreements are included our
policies and procedures. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our
employees are good.

7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. This discussion should be read in conjunction
with the other sections of this Form 10-K, including Risk Factors, and the Financial Statements. The various sections of
this discussion contain a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected
by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Forward-Looking Statements. 
Our actual results may differ materially. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates
and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. 

As
used in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, except where the
context otherwise requires, the term we, us, our, or the Company, refers to the
business of Sun Power Holdings Corp. 

Organizational
Overview 

Utilizing
managements history in general contracting, coupled with our subject matter expertise and intellectual property IP knowledge
of solar panels and other leading-edge technologies, Sun Pacific Holding the Company is focused on building a Next
Generation green energy company. The Company offers competitively priced Next Generation solar panel and lighting
products by working closely with design, engineering, integration and installation firms in order to deliver turnkey solar and other
energy efficient solutions. We provide solar bus stops, solar trashcans and street kiosks that utilize our unique advertising
offerings that provide State and local municipalities with costs efficient solutions. 

Our
green energy solutions can be customized to meet most enterprise and/or government mandated regulations and advanced system requirements.
Our portfolio of products and services allow our clients to select a solution that enables them to establish a viable standard product
offering that focuses on the goals of the client s entire organization. 

Currently,
the Company has four (4) subsidiary holdings. Sun Pacific Power Corp., which was the initial company that specialized in solar 
other renewable energy projects., The Company also formed National Mechanical Group Corp, a New Jersey corporation focused on holding
the Company s patents. The Company also formed Street Smart Outdoor Corp, a Wyoming corporation that acts as a holding company
for the Company s state specific operations in unique advertising through solar bus stops, solar trashcans and street kiosks. 
The Company also formed Elba Power Corp, an Alabama Corp for the development of a Solar Assembly company. Elba Power Corp has entered
into a property purchase contract for approximately 3 million, pending financing, and has obtained the approval for an inducement resolution
for 50 million dollars from the State of Alabama, along with a 100 tax abatement on sales and use tax in support of the development
of a solar assembly plant. Elba Power Corp is currently working with potential funders in support of the capitalization and development
of the project. 

Sun
Pacific Power Corp. has entered into an agreement with FoxEss, a global leader in the development
of inverter and energy storage solutions as a wholesale distributer for North and South America and Australia. Sun Pacific Power Corp.
has also entered into an agreement with a South Asian solar manufacturer to act as an original equipment manufacturer OEM for Sun Pacific Solar Panels and associated products. Sun Pacific Power Corp has also commenced in April 2023, a sales, marketing, and
affiliate program to market and install residential solar panels in various markets within the United States. 

9 

As
of today, our principal source of revenues is derived from Street Smart Outdoor Corp. operations in the outdoor advertising business
with contracts in place in New Jersey and Florida. 

Strategic
Vision 

Our
objective is to grow our business as a premier green energy-based provider of both product and services to the public and private sectors.
We are working to deploy our strategy in building upon our green energy expertise in conjunction with our intellectual property and subject
matter expertise that may allow us to grow a group of business lines in solar and other unique energy related areas. 

Recent
advances in a multitude of different yet converging technologies have significantly improved the ability to integrate energy efficient
products and solutions into infrastructure related projects. These technological advances decrease the requirements needed to jointly
operate a multitude of differing assets, devices, and tools that create new ways to integrate evolving new technologies. This technological
change and convergence in energy efficient devices, integrated communications among devices, and societal needs to more effectively and
environmentally friendly we believe presents a significant opportunity for us in providing and supporting simple to complex integrated
solutions. 

Our
challenges continue to be reaching critical mass in our solar shelter business, expanding into other green energy related projects, and
securing operational capital. While the Company has never been adequately funded from inception, the Company has attempted to use debt,
equity, and other opportunistic in-kind compensation to further the Company s strategic vision. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately 8.0 million and a working capital deficit of approximately 3.1 million as of December
31, 2022. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations
to meet its obligations and/or obtain additional financing from its stockholders and/or other third parties. 

In
order to further implement its business plan and satisfy its working capital requirements, the Company will need to raise additional
capital. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise additional equity or debt financing at acceptable terms, if at
all. 

There
is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that
may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Those material accounting
estimates that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition are discussed
immediately below and are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the
application of significant judgment by our management to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain
estimates. 

Use
of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements 

Preparation
of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment assessments related to long-lived
assets. 

10 

Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned, and less-than-wholly owned subsidiaries of
which the Company holds a controlling interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Amounts
attributable to minority interests in the Company s less-than-wholly owned subsidiary are presented as non-controlling interest
on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations. 

Cash
and cash equivalents 

For
purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes demand deposits and short-term liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC provided insurance coverage of up
to 250,000, per depositor, per institution. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, none of the Company s cash balances were in excess
of federally insured limits. Any and all withdrawals are strictly controlled by the lending institution and use of proceeds must be approved
prior to release of funds. 

Accounts
Receivable 

In
the normal course of business, we decide to extend credit to certain customers without requiring collateral or other security interests.
Management reviews its accounts receivable at each reporting period to provide for an allowance against accounts receivable for an amount
that could become uncollectible. This review process may involve the identification of payment problems with specific customers. Periodically
we estimate this allowance based on the aging of the accounts receivable, historical collection experience, and other relevant factors,
such as changes in the economy and the imposition of regulatory requirements that can have an impact on the industry. These factors continuously
change and can have an impact on collections and our estimation process. The Company determined that an allowance for doubtful accounts was not necessary as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Leases

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 (Topic 842). Topic 842 amends several aspects of lease accounting, including requiring
lessees to recognize leases with a term greater than one year as a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability, measured at the present
value of the lease payments. In July 2018, the FASB issued supplemental adoption guidance and clarification to Topic 842 within ASU 2018-10
 Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases and ASU 2018-11 Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements. The new
guidance aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease
liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. A modified retrospective application
is required with an option to not restate comparative periods in the period of adoption. 

The
Company, effective January 1, 2019 has adopted the provisions of the new standard. The Company has operating leases for warehouses and
offices. Management evaluates each lease independently to determine the purpose, necessity to its future operations in addition to other
appropriate facts and circumstances. 

We
adopted Topic 842 using a modified retrospective approach for all existing leases at January 1, 2019. The adoption of Topic 842 impacted
our balance sheet by the recognition of the operating lease right-of-use assets and the liability for operating leases. Accordingly,
upon adoption, leases that were classified as operating leases under the previous guidance were classified as operating leases under
Topic 842. The lease liability is based on the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using a market based incremental
borrowing rate as the effective date of January 1, 2019 using current estimates as to lease term including estimated renewals for each
operating lease. As of January 1, 2019, the Company recorded an adjustment of approximately 1,339,000 to operating lease right-of-use
assets ROU and the related lease liability (Note 7). 

11 

Contingencies

Certain
conditions may exist as of the date financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss, but which will only be resolved when
one or more future events occur or do not occur. We assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise
of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to pending legal proceedings that are pending against us or unasserted claims that
may result in such proceedings, we evaluate the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived
merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in
our consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is
reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of
the range of possible loss if determinable would be disclosed. 

Fair
value of financial instruments 

The
carrying amounts of the Company s accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and accrued expenses due to related parties approximate fair
value due to their short-term nature. The Company s long-term debt approximates fair value given the instruments bear market rates of interest. 

Property
and equipment 

Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Additions and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the life of
an asset are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over
three to five years for vehicles and five to ten years for equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated
remaining useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term. 

Impairment
of long-lived assets 

The
Company periodically reviews for the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be realizable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result
from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has
not identified any such impairment losses. 

Income
taxes 

Under
ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes , the Company is required to account for its income taxes through the establishment of a deferred tax
asset or liability for the recognition of future deductible or taxable amounts and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred
tax expense or benefit is recognized as a result of timing differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for book and
tax purposes during the year. 

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating
losses, and tax credit carry forwards. A valuation allowance is established to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is more likely
than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer
in accordance with Topic 606. Revenue from the sale of advertising space on displays from the Company s Outdoor Advertising Shelter
Revenues is generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract as the advertisement is displayed. 

The
Company recognizes revenue in amounts that reflect the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services
to customers, excluding sales taxes and other similar taxes collected on behalf of governmental authorities (the transaction price ).
When this consideration includes a variable amount, the Company estimates the amount of consideration it expects to receive and only
recognizes revenue to the extent that it is probable it will not be reversed in a future reporting period. Because the transfer of promised
goods and services to the customer is generally within a year of scheduled payment from the customer, the Company is not typically required
to consider the effects of the time value of money when determining the transaction price. Advertising revenue is reported net of agency
commissions. 

In
order to appropriately identify the unit of accounting for revenue recognition, the Company determines which promised goods and services
in a contract with a customer are distinct and are therefore separate performance obligations. If a promised good or service does not
meet the criteria to be considered distinct, it is combined with other promised goods or services until a distinct bundle of goods or
services exists. 

For
revenue arrangements that contain multiple distinct goods or services, the Company allocates the transaction price to these performance
obligations in proportion to their relative standalone selling prices. The Company has concluded that the contractual prices for the
promised goods and services in its standard contracts generally approximate management s best estimate of standalone selling price
as the rates reflect various factors such as the size and characteristics of the target audience, market location and size, and recent
market selling prices. However, where the Company provides customers with free or discounted services as part of contract negotiations,
management uses judgment to determine how much of the transaction price to allocate to these performance obligations. 

The
Company receives payments from customers based on billing schedules that are established in its contracts, and deferred revenue is recorded
when payment is received from a customer before the Company has satisfied the performance obligation or a non-cancelable contract has
been billed in advance in accordance with the Company s normal billing terms. 

All of the Company s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, is recognized based on
the Company s satisfaction of distinct performance obligations identified in each agreement, generally at a point in time as
defined by Topic 606, as amended. 

In
May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers. This standard replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance and is codified in FASB ASC Topic 606. Effective
January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09 using the modified retrospective method. Under the new guidance, the Company recognizes
revenue from contracts based on the Company s satisfaction of distinct performance obligations identified in each agreement. The
adoption of the guidance under ASU No. 2014-09 did not result in a material impact on the Company s consolidated revenues, results
of operations, or financial position. As part of the implementation of ASC 606 the Company must present disaggregation of revenues from
contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by
economic factors. Quantitative disclosures on the disaggregation of revenue are as follows:

Earnings
Per Share 

Under
ASC 260, Earnings Per Share EPS ), the Company provides for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
Basic EPS includes no dilution and is computed by dividing income or loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings
or losses of the entity. For the year ended December 31, 2022, basic and diluted loss per share are the same as the calculation of diluted
per share amounts would result in an anti-dilutive calculation. The following summarizes the calculation of diluted income per share
for the year ended December 31, 2021:

Results
of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Revenues

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues decreased 112,020, from 377,593 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 265,573 in 2022,
as a result of more advertising revenues and less general contracting services as the Company migrates away from general contracting
services and towards the development of Green Energy Projects including the sale of Solar powered shelters and other energy related projects
that derive income from advertising sources. The Company has entered into revenue sharing agreements with the City of Tallahassee and
the State of New Jersey, along with others. Depending upon the timing of installation and advertising revenue generated per shelter and
or other advertising-based product, the Company s Revenue may increase materially from this green energy offering. 

Cost
of Revenues 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, cost of revenues decreased by 10,401, from 27,044 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 16,643
in 2022, as a result of less general contracting services revenues. Costs of revenues may shift dramatically depending upon how the Company s
comparative revenue profile of the products and services shift in the future. 

Operating
Expenses 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, operating expenses increased by 95,248, from 441,311 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 536,559
in need to disclose the reason for the increase - professional fees increased 33,083 and general and administrative increased 63,284. 

13 

Other
Income (Expenses) 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, other income (expenses) decreased by 42,865 from total other expense of 33,846 for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to 9,019 total other income for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Net
Loss from Continuing Operations 

As
a result of the above, the Company incurred Net (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations of (278,610) and 696,113 for the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Net
Working Capital 

We
have, since inception, financed operations and capital expenditures through the sale of stock and convertible notes and debt. Our immediate
sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and unbilled receivables. 

At
December 31, 2022, we had a net working capital deficit of approximately 3,120,589 compared to 2,883,433 at December 31, 2021. 

We
intend to seek additional financing for our working capital, in the form of equity or debt, to provide us with the necessary capital
to accomplish our plan of operation. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to raise additional capital. 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we received 0 and 35,905, respectively, from the Payroll Protection Program. 

Generally,
the Company has insufficient capital to maintain operations. Cashflows from operations of the Company and all its subsidiary holdings
will not sustain the Company s operations, let alone its filing requirements, unless there is substantial influx of cash flow through
either debt and/or equity financing. 

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities 

Cash
provided by operating activities provides an indication of our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from our recurring business activities.
Fixed costs such as labor, direct materials, and office rent represent a significant portion of the Company s continuing operating
costs. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operations was 17,925 driven primarily by net loss offset by decreases in accounts
receivable and increases in accrued compensation to officers. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operations was approximately 522,748 driven primarily by current year operating loss,
and 272,304 of cash deconsolidated. 

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by investing activities was approximately 96,000, from the sale of property. 

There
were no investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

Cash
provided by financing activities provides an indication of our debt financing and proceeds from capital raise transactions. 

There
were no financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

14 

For
the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by financing activities was approximately 535,905, from the issuance of convertible
debt of 500,000 and 35,905 of proceeds from the payroll protection program. 

In
the short term, we must raise additional capital through debt or equity financing to support our business operations and grow our business.
Over the long term, we must successfully execute our growth plans to increase profitable revenue and income streams to generate positive
cash flows to sustain adequate liquidity without impairing growth initiatives or requiring the infusion of additional funds from external
sources to meet minimum operating requirements. We may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and there can be no assurance
that additional capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures for the Company.
3As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer performed an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based
on the evaluation and the identification of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s disclosure controls

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation,
with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report
, using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission. The term internal control over financial reporting , as defined under Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Exchange Act, means a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the issuer s principal executive officer and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by issuer s board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the issuer; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements. Based upon the evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting at the end of the period covered
by this report, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s internal control
over financial reporting were not effective as a result of continuing weaknesses principally due to the following: 

-
 
 The
 Company has not established adequate financial reporting monitoring activities to mitigate the risk of management override, specifically
 because there are few employees and only one officers with management functions and therefore there is lack of segregation of duties.

-
 
 An
 outside consultant assists in the preparation of the annual and quarterly financial statements and partners with the Company to ensure
 compliance with US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. 

-
 
 Outside
 counsel assists the Company in the external attorneys to review and editing of the annual and quarterly filings and to ensure compliance
 with SEC disclosure requirements. 

At
such time as the Company raises additional working capital it plans to add staff, initiate training, add additional subject matter expertise
in its finance area so that it may improve it processes, policies, procedures, and documentation of its internal control processes. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 percentage ownership is based on 974,953,335 shares of common stock outstanding as of April 13, 2021. Beneficial ownership is determined
 in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and generally includes voting or investment power with respect
 to securities. Shares of common stock that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of are deemed to be beneficially
 owned by the person holding such securities for computing the percentage of ownership of such person but are not treated as outstanding
 for computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Nicholas Campanella, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer holds 12,000,000
 shares of Series A Preferred Stock as of April 17, 2023. The Series A Preferred Stock has voting rights equal to 125 votes on all
 matters submitted to a vote to the stockholders of the Company, does not have conversion, dividend or distribution upon liquidation
 rights. As a result, Mr. Campanella has the equivalent to 1,500,000,000 votes. Therefore, although the officers, directors and beneficial
 holders of shares greater than 5 of the common stock have voting rights equal to 3.48 of the voting rights of the common stock,
 this amounts to only 3.67 of the total voting rights available. Mr. Campanella thus has just over 50 of the total voting rights.

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sun Pacific Holding Corp. and Subsidiaries (the Company as
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for
each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated
financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations since inception
and has a significant working capital deficiency, both of which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

/s/ . 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2017.
