Covid-19 

In
March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic throughout the United States.
While the initial outbreak concentrated in China, it spread to several other countries, including Russia and Cyprus, and reported infections
globally. Many countries worldwide, including the United States, have implemented significant governmental measures to control the spread
of the virus, including temporary closure of businesses, severe restrictions on travel and the movement of people, and other material
limitations on trade. These measures have resulted in work stoppages, absenteeism in the Company s labor workforce, and other disruptions.
The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations will depend on future developments. These developments are highly uncertain.
We cannot predict them with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak and the actions required to contain the coronavirus
or treat its impact. In particular, the spread of the coronavirus globally could adversely impact our operations and workforce, including
our marketing and sales activities and ability to raise additional capital, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operation
results.

development office in Russia. We relocated our personnel to Turkey, currently considered a neutral zone. No individual associated

During
the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company incurred General and administrative costs G and A of
 1,679,121 and 1,127,503, respectively. The increase in G and A costs for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, was mainly due to
higher professional consulting fees related to common stock issued for services. The G and A expenses were 26.02 and 246.36 of
the fiscal revenue for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, and 2021. Amortization expenses were 159,051 and 274,462 for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2022, and 2021 respectively, and the Company has included them in the Cost of sales expense. The decrease in
amortization expense for the fiscal year ending December 2022 is due to the complete amortization of Condor Back Office, Condor Crypto
Trading Platform, and Condor FX Trading Platform (Desktop).

rental expenses were 25,438 and 29,705 for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, and 2021. Effective October 29, 2019, the Company

year ending December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The sales and marketing costs increase due to increased stock-based compensation
to certain marketing and branding consultants. The sales and marketing costs mainly included stock-based payment to marketing and branding
consultants, travel costs for tradeshows, customer meetings, online marketing on industry websites, press releases, and public relations
activities. The sales, marketing, and advertising expenses represented 5.93 and 141.77 of the sales for the fiscal year ending December

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

On
December 31, 2022, and 2021, we had a cash balance of 264,829 and 93,546, respectively. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, the working
capital surplus and deficit were 541,359 and 199,132, respectively. The increase in the working capital surplus was mainly due to
the acquisition of NSFX, resulting in the increase of current assets over current liabilities as of December 31, 2022. 

In
the next twelve (12) months, the Company will continue investing in sales, marketing, product development, new technology solutions,
and existing technology support to serve our customers. We expect capital expenditures to increase to 500,000 in the next twelve (12)
months to support the growth, including working capital, software development, sales marketing, and purchasing computers and servers. 

We
expect the combination of existing cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and access to private equity and capital markets
to be sufficient for at least twelve (12) months. The availability of funds will fund our operating activities to meet the need for investing
and financing, such as debt maturities and material capital expenditures. However, we may need additional funds to achieve a sustainable
sales level to fund our ongoing operations out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or,
if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. 

Should
we require additional capital, the Company s operations are insufficient to fund its capital requirements. The Company may attempt
to restructure Notes, refinance existing Notes with financial institutions, or raise capital by selling additional capital stock or debt
issuance. The Company intends to continue growing its operations and raising funds through private equity and debt financing.

GOING
CONCERN CONSIDERATION 

We
have generated revenues of 6,453,732 for the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company
had an accumulated deficit of 4,335,053 and 3,230,679. Our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on
the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the period from January 21, 2016 (inception)
to December 31, 2016, regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional
note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors. Our financial statements do not
include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classifications
of liabilities that may result in the Company being unable to continue as a going concern. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

We
have based our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operations results on our financial statements,
which we have prepared following the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our financial statements, we are required
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Our actual results could differ from these estimates, and such differences could be material. 

We
have described significant accounting policies in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in our 10-K for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by
our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as appropriate based on changing conditions. 

JOBS
Act Accounting Election 

We
are an emerging growth company , defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay
adopting new or revised accounting standards after enacting the JOBS Act until those standards apply to private companies. We have applied
for exemption as an emerging growth company; thus, the Company may delay adopting certain accounting standards until the standards would
otherwise apply to private companies. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

We
have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements defined in Item 303(c) of the SEC s Regulation S-B. We had no relationships
with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been
established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

The
ASU amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods therein. Early adoption of
the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. We
have adopted ASC 606 - Revenue Recognition from January 1, 2019, and Amended ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 840) from January 1, 2020. The
ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe the accounting policies
described in Note 2 are critical to the judgments and estimates used to prepare our financial statements. As a result, we have described
significant accounting policies in more detail in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in our 10-K for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2021, were not effective in ensuring that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. The term disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means
controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, management believes the financial
statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition, results
of operations, and cash flows at and for the periods presented following U.S. GAAP. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, that
has materially affected or is reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting materially.

18 

Term
of Office 

All
directors serve until the next annual meeting; their successors are elected and qualified. Officers are appointed to serve for one year
until the board of directors meeting following the stockholders annual meeting until the Directors successors have
been elected and qualified. 

Director
of Independence 

Our
board of directors is currently composed of four (4) members, out of which three (3) directors are executive directors and who do not
qualify as independent directors by the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market (the Company has no plans to list
on the NASDAQ Global Market). The third non-executive director is an independent director. The NASDAQ independence definition includes
a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three (3) years, one of our employees and
that neither the director nor any of his family members have engaged in various types of business dealings with us. Also, our board of
directors has not made a subjective determination as to our director that no relationships exist, which, in the opinion of our board
of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. However,
the NASDAQ rules require such subjective determination. Had our board of directors made these determinations, they would have reviewed
and discussed the information provided by directors and us concerning our director s business and personal activities and relationships
as they may relate to us and our management. 

Audit
Committee and Conflicts of Interest 

Since
we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that such committees would have performed
are performed by our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee and does not have an audit committee
financial expert, nor has the Board of Directors established a nominating committee. The Board believes such committees are unnecessary
since the Company is an early start-up company with only three (3) directors. To date, such directors have been performing the functions
of such committees. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our three (3) directors and officers have the authority to
determine issues concerning management compensation, nominations, and audit issues that may affect management decisions. 

There
are no family relationships among our directors or officers other than as described above. We are unaware of any other conflicts of interest
with our executive officers or directors. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

No
director, person nominated to become a director, executive officer, promoter, or control person of our Company has, during the last ten
(10) years: (i) been convicted in or is currently subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor
offenses); (ii) been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of
the such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating
activities subject to any federal or state securities or banking or commodities laws including, without limitation, in any way limiting
involvement in any business activity, or finding any violation to such law, nor (iii) any bankruptcy petition been filed by or against
the business of which such person was an executive officer or a general partner, whether at the time of the bankruptcy or for the two
(2) years prior thereto. 

Stockholder
Communications with the Board Of Directors 

We

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the shareholders and the board of directors of FDCTech, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FDCTech, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of
operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to
as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In
addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Covid-19 

In
March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic throughout the United States.
While the initial outbreak concentrated in China, it spread to several other countries, including Russia and Cyprus, and reported infections
globally. Many countries worldwide, including the United States, have implemented significant governmental measures to control the spread
of the virus, including temporary closure of businesses, severe restrictions on travel and the movement of people, and other material
limitations on trade. These measures have resulted in work stoppages, absenteeism in the Company s labor workforce, and other disruptions.
The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations will depend on future developments. These developments are highly uncertain.
We cannot predict them with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak and the actions required to contain the coronavirus
or treat its impact. In particular, the spread of the coronavirus globally could adversely impact our operations and workforce, including
our marketing and sales activities and ability to raise additional capital, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operation
results.

and in sales, marketing, and advertising costs sales and marketing for the fiscal

activities. The sales, marketing, and advertising expenses represented and of the fiscal year s sales ended December
31, 2022, and 2021. 

Note
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

The
Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts not completed as of January 1, 2019. The Company
presents results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019, under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are reported following
legacy GAAP. In addition to the above guidelines, the Company also considers implementation guidance on warranties, customer options,
licensing, and other topics. The Company considers revenue collectability, methods for measuring progress toward complete satisfaction
of a performance obligation, warranties, customer options for additional goods or services, nonrefundable upfront fees, licensing, customer
acceptance, and other relevant categories. 

The
Company accounts for a contract when it and the customer parties have approved the agreement and are committed to fulfilling
their obligations. Each party can identify its rights, obligations, and payment terms; the contract has commercial substance. The Company
will probably collect all of the consideration. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control
of the promised service to a customer. The Company fixes the transaction price for goods and services at contract inception. The Company s
standard payment terms are generally net 30 days and, in some cases, due upon receipt of the invoice. 

The
Company considers the change in scope, price, or both as contract modifications. The parties describe contract modification as a change
order, a variation, or an amendment. A contract modification exists when the parties approve a modification that either creates new or
changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. The Company assumes a contract modification by oral agreement or implied by the
customer s customary business practice when agreed in writing. If the parties to the contract have not approved a contract modification,
the Company continues to apply the existing contract s guidance until the contract modification is approved. The Company recognizes
contract modification in various forms partial termination, an extension of the contract term with a corresponding price increase,
adding new goods or services to the contract, with or without a corresponding price change, and reducing the contract price without a
change in goods/services promised. 

At
contract inception, the Company assesses the solutions or services, or bundles of solutions and services, obligated in the contract with
a customer to identify each performance obligation within the contract and then evaluate whether the performance obligations are capable
of being distinct and distinct within the context of the agreement. Solutions and services incapable of being distinct and distinct
within the contract context are combined and treated as a single performance obligation in determining the allocation and recognition
of revenue. For multi-element transactions, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative
stand-alone selling price basis. The Company determines the stand-alone selling price for each item at the transaction s inception
involving these multiple elements. 

Note
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Since
January 21, 2016 Inception ), the Company has derived its revenues mainly from consulting services, technology solutions,
and customized software development. The Company recognizes revenue when it has satisfied a performance obligation by transferring control
over a product or delivering a service to a customer. We measure revenue based on the consideration outlined in an arrangement or contract
with a customer. 

The
Company s typical performance obligations include the following: 

Performance
 Obligation 
 
 Types
 of Deliverables 
 
 When
 Performance Obligation is Typically Satisfied 
 
 Consulting
 Services 
 
 Consulting
 related to Start-Your-Own-Brokerage SYOB ), Start-Your-Own-Prime Brokerage SYOPB ), Start-Your-Own-Crypto
 Exchange SYOC ), FX/OTC liquidity solutions and lead generations. 
 
 The
 Company recognizes the consulting revenues when the customer receives services over the contract length. If the customer pays the
 Company in advance for these services, the Company records such payment as deferred revenue until the Company completes the services. 

Technology
 Services 
 
 Licensing
 of Condor Risk Management Back Office Condor Risk Management ), Condor FX Pro Trading Terminal, Condor Pricing Engine,
 Crypto Trading Platform Crypto Web Trader Platform ), and other cryptocurrency-related solutions. 
 
 The
 Company recognizes ratably over the contractual period that the services are delivered, beginning on the date such service is made
 available to the customer. Licensing agreements are typically one year in length with an option to cancel by giving notice; customers
 have the right to terminate their agreements if the Company materially breaches its obligations under the agreement. Licensing agreements
 do not provide customers the right to take possession of the software. The Company charges the customers a set-up fee for installing
 the platform, and implementation activities are insignificant and not subject to a separate fee. 

Software
 Development 
 
 Design
 and build development software projects for customers, where the Company develops the project to meet the design criteria and performance
 requirements as specified in the contract. 
 
 The
 Company recognizes the software development revenues when the Customer obtains control of the deliverables as stated in the Statement-of-Work
 contract. 

The
Company assumes that the goods or services promised in the existing contract will be transferred to the customer to determine the transaction
price. The Company believes that the contract will not be canceled, renewed, or modified; therefore, the transaction price includes only
those amounts to which the Company has rights under the present contract. For example, if the Company enters into a contract with a customer
with an original term of one year and expects the customer to renew for a second year, the Company would determine the transaction price
based on the initial one-year period. When choosing the transaction price, the company first identifies the fixed consideration, including
non-refundable upfront payment amounts. 

To
allocate the transaction price, the Company gives an amount that best represents the consideration that the entity expects to receive
for transferring each promised good or service to the customer. The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation
identified in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis to meet the allocation objective. In determining the standalone
selling price, the Company uses the best evidence of the stand-alone selling price that the Company charges to similar customers in similar
circumstances. The Company sometimes uses the adjusted market assessment approach to determine the standalone selling price. It evaluates
the market in which it sells the goods or services and estimates the price that customers in that market would pay for those goods or
services when sold separately. 

The
Company recognizes revenue when or as it transfers the promised goods or services in the contract. The Company considers the transfers 
the promised goods or services when the customer obtains control of the goods or services. The Company believes a customer obtains
control of an asset when it can directly use and substantially obtain all the remaining benefits from an asset. The Company recognizes
deferred revenue related to services it will deliver within one year as a current liability. The Company presents deferred revenue related
to services that the Company will provide more than one year into the future as a non-current liability. 

For
the period ending December 31, 2019, the Company s two primary revenue streams accounted for under ASC 606 follows: 

The

Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ,
issued in August 2020 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock by removing the requirements to
present certain conversion features in equity separately. In addition, the amendments also simplify the guidance in ASC Subtopic 815-40,
Derivatives and Hedging: Contracts in Entity s Own Equity, by removing certain criteria that must be satisfied to classify a contract
as equity, which is expected to decrease the number of freestanding instruments and embedded derivatives accounted for as assets or liabilities.
Finally, the amendments revise the guidance on calculating earnings per share, requiring the use of the if-converted method for all convertible
instruments and rescinding an entity s ability to rebut the presumption of share settlement for instruments that may be settled
in cash or other assets. The amendments are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early
adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The guidance must be adopted as of the beginning

December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company has earned increased revenues year-over-year and decreased operating expenses as a percentage
of total revenue. As a result, the Company continues to experience limited cash flows from operations and the ongoing requirement for
substantial additional capital investment to develop its financial technologies. The Management expects that it will need to raise significant
additional capital to accomplish its growth plan over the next twelve (12) months. The Management expects to seek to obtain additional
funding through private equity or public markets. However, there can be no assurance about the availability or terms such as financing
and capital might be available.

to enter into a revolving loan agreement with financial institutions or raise capital through the sale of additional capital stock or
issuance of debt.

In
2022 and 2021, the Company had pre-tax income and losses of and , respectively, available for carry-forward to offset
future taxable income. The Management has determined to provide full valuation allowances for our net deferred tax assets at the end
of 2022 and 2021, including Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryforwards generated during the years. We could realize our deferred tax assets
based on its evaluation of positive and negative evidence, including our history of operating losses and the uncertainty of generating
future taxable income. 

On
December 22, 2017, the United States President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act ). The Act amends the Internal
Revenue Code to reduce tax rates and modify individual and business policies, credits, and deductions. As we provided a full valuation allowance against
our net deferred tax assets, we have not recorded any tax impact due to the tax rate change. 

Note
12. Income Taxes (continued) 

In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income when
those temporary differences become deductible. The Company believes it is unlikely to realize the benefits of NOL carryforward. In recognition
of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of on the deferred tax assets related to these NOL carryforwards. Suppose
our assumptions change, and we determine that we can realize these NOLs. In that case, the tax benefits related to any reversal of the
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022, will be accounted for as follows: the Company will recognize approximately
 as an increased income tax expense and record as a decrease in equity. 

Based
on the available objective evidence, management believes it is likely that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable on
December 31, 2022. Accordingly, management maintained a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets on December 31,
2022. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the twelve (12) months ending December 31, 2022, decreased by . On
December 31, 2022, and 2021, we had federal and state net operating income and loss carry-forwards of approximately and ,
respectively, expiring in 2037 for the federal and 2037 for the state. 

For
the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company analyzed its ASC 740 position and had not identified any uncertain tax positions
defined under ASC 740. Should such a position be identified in the future, and if the Company owes interest and penalties, these would
be recognized as interest expense and other expense, respectively, in the consolidated financial statements. 

The
Company has identified the United States Federal tax returns as its major tax jurisdiction. The Company has submitted and
received acceptance of the United States Federal return for 2022 and 2021. The Company was not subject to tax examination by authorities
in the United States before 2016. The State Franchise Tax return for 2022 and 2021 has been submitted and accepted by Delaware State
Franchise Tax Board. Currently, the Company does not have any ongoing tax examinations. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company has assessed federal and state payroll tax payments in the aggregate amount of , and we have
included it in the General and administrative expenses. The Company has foreign tax expenses and liabilities as of December 31, 2022,
and 2021. 

common shares valued at and in six equal installments of each from
February 2023 to July 2023 to settle the difference in consideration shares issued with the AJB Note. 

FINRA Rule 1017 requires the Company to file continuing membership applications (CMAs) as it plans to apply for changes in ownership,
control, and business operations. The Company filed the CMA form with FINRA in February 2023 to effect the change of ownership of CIM
Securities, LLC, where the Company interest shall be . 

In
February 2023, the Company paid off all the outstanding balance of and any accrued interest related to the AJB Note. 

In
February 2023, the Company issued shares to Alchemy Prime Ltd for . The Company used the funds to pay off the outstanding
AJB Note. 

On December 31, 2022, the Company announced the sales
purchase agreement Agreement under which the Company acquired a equity interest in New Star Capital Trading Ltd.,
a British Virgin Island company New Star and its operating subsidiary NSFX Ltd NSFX ). NSFX is an online
trading brokerage firm regulated by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). The Company will assume a business acquisition loan
liability of to purchase the controlling interest in NSFX. The Company amended the Agreement to February 28, 2023, to comply
with the BVI Companies Act requirement for the change of ownership. The Company expects to consolidate the fair value of NSFX s
assets and liabilities on or after February 28, 2023 but no later than June 30, 2023.. 

In March 2023, the Company issued shares
for cash.
