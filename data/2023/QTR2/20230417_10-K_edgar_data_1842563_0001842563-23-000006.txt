DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Overview 

Go Go Buyers Inc. is a company developing and promoting
a customized platform for online shoppers and travelers. The platform is intended to become a marketplace that leverages products and
services among people who travel the world. To use our service, a buyer needs to create an order and tell a traveler how much the item
costs and where it can be purchased. The order will then appear in the order feed, and travelers heading to the specified country can
respond and make an offer for delivery and monetary compensation. Bringing travel innovation to the forefront traveling becomes even more
beneficial. 

Go Go Buyers Inc. develops and and plans to market
two AI-enabled API services. The first service tracks flight prices and enables users to compare prices from multiple suppliers, creating
complex flight itineraries in the required currency. The second service includes generating and comparing hotel prices featuring a database
of over two hundred suppliers. We expect our product will attract travel agencies, hoteliers, and IT companies that develop software for
the tourism industry. 

Our next-year plan seeks to advance travel services
and develop communication links for our customers that are easily accessible, understandable, and logical. This will contribute to improving
interaction with our customers throughout the trip. 

The principal office of the Company is located at
5348 Vegas Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89108. Our telephone number is +15305394950.

Marketing 

Online marketing as the key strategy to attract the
users. During the initial stages of development, we plan to focus on investing in promotion through various social media platforms and
search engine optimization. This approach is intended to enhance our visibility in user search inquiries based on relevant keywords. By
following this strategy, we anticipate garnering the attention of potential customers, whom we refer to as platform users 
or simply users . Additionally, we plan to utilize traditional methods such as direct calls and mailing with business proposals,
along with references to our platform and social media pages. In order to attract potential platform users, we plan to purchase advertising
slots on prominent websites related to delivery services. With more advanced investments, we intend to create promotional videos related
to delivery and shipping, for advertising purposes. As our business grows, we may consider running a television promotional campaign. 

Clients 

We anticipate that both small businesses and individuals
will register with our web platform, utilizing it as a means to connect with potential clients and increase their visibility or for personal
usage. For developing businesses, we expect that our platform will be particularly appealing as it may provide them with access to a target
audience. For individuals, the online nature of our service will enable them to search for the most convenient and cost-effective delivery
options. Furthermore, we anticipate that our platform will foster increased competition within the industry, as rival companies may monitor
each other's activity, resulting in more favorable offers for our clientele. 

Government Regulation 

The Company will be required to comply with all regulations,
rules, and directives of governmental authorities including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and agencies applicable to our business
in any jurisdiction with which we would conduct activities. The Company does not believe that governmental regulations will have a material
impact on the way we conduct our business.

Market Information 

There is a limited public market for our common shares.
Our common shares are not quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board at this time. Trading in stocks quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is often thin
and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated to a company s operations
or business prospects. We cannot assure you that there will be a market in the future for our common stock. 

OTC Bulletin Board securities are not listed or traded
on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Bulletin Board securities transactions are conducted through
a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. OTC Bulletin Board issuers are traditionally smaller companies that do
not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange.

are traded.

audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Go Go Buyers Inc Company ), which comprise of balance sheet
as of December 31, 2022, and the related consolidated statement of operations and accumulated deficit, stockholder s equity and
cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.

in its net assets for a year in the period then ended, and the financial highlights in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

 Basis
for Opinion 

 These financial
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

 NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 December 31, 2022 

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest
and penalties as of December 31, 2022. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant
payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. 

The Company has identified the United States as its only major 
tax jurisdiction. 

The Company may be subject to potential examination
by federal and state taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing
and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Company s
management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.

interest on a 22,917 non-interest bearing related party note during the year ended December 31, 2022. Interest is being imputed on the
note at 8 per annum. 

On October 25, 2020, the Company entered into a Verbal
Agreement with its President, pursuant to which he agreed to provide financing to the Company with total amount not exceeding 50,000.
The loan is to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. This loan is non-interest bearing and does not have a due date. 

that may be available to reduce future years taxable income in varying amounts through
2033. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their
realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset
relating to these tax loss carry-forwards. 

The valuation allowance at December 31, 2022 was approximately
 . In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized.

 NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 December 31, 2022 

The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets
is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making
this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the
realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022.
All tax years since inception remain open for examination by taxing authorities.

Management s Report on Internal Controls
over Financial Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation
of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer at the time, the Company conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, using the criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in 2013. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, the Company determined that there were control
deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

1. The Company does not have an adequate internal control structure or adequate oversight over financial
reporting The Company has no employees and only one member of management whom is also the Company s sole director, therefore
the Company lacks adequate segregation of duties. Further, the Company currently has no Audit Committee. While not being legally obligated
to have an audit committee, it is the management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost
important entity level control over the Company s financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of
the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight
over management s activities. Lastly, due to the minimal operations and small size of the Company we have not employed individuals
that have the necessary accounting knowledge and expertise to ensure accurate financial reporting under US GAAP. 

2. The Company lacks appropriate information technology controls As of December 31, 2022, the Company
retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however, there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the
Company s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. 

Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control
deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 

20 

As a result of the material weaknesses described above,
management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022,
based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO in 2013. 

System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including
its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management at the time of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting during the annual period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. 

The following table sets forth certain
information relating to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of December 31, 2022, by: 

each person, or group of
affiliated persons, known by us to beneficially own more than five percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock;

 Common Stock 
 
 3,000,000 shares of common stock

The number of shares beneficially owned by each entity,
person, director or executive officer is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC, and the information is not necessarily indicative
of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under such rules, beneficial ownership includes any shares over which the individual has
sole or shared voting power or dispositive power as well as any shares that the individual has the right to acquire within 60 days of
the date through the exercise of any stock option, warrants or other rights. Except as otherwise indicated, and subject to applicable
community property laws, the persons named in the table have sole voting and dispositive power with respect to all shares of common stock
held by that person. The percentage of shares beneficially owned is computed on the basis of 4,045,069 shares of our common stock outstanding
as of the date of this annual report. 

Shares of common stock that a person has the right
to acquire within 60 days of the date are deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of the person holding
such rights, but are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person, except with respect
to the percentage ownership of all directors and executive officers as a group. 

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. 

For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the
