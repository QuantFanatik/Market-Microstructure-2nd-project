ITEM

 BUSINESS. 

Overview 

We
were originally incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on August 31, 1992. On October 9, 2020, we entered into a share exchange
agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement with Wetouch Holding Group Limited, a British Virgin Islands company incorporated
on August 14, 2020 under the laws of the British Virgin Islands BVI Wetouch ), and all the shareholders of BVI Wetouch
(each a Shareholder and collectively the Shareholders ), to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital
stock of BVI Wetouch in exchange for the issuance to the Shareholders an aggregate of 28 million shares of our common stock (the Reverse
Merger ). The Reverse Merger closed on October 9, 2020. Immediately after the closing of the Reverse Merger, we had a total of
31,396,394 issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a result of the Reverse Merger, BVI Wetouch is now our wholly-owned subsidiary. 

Through
our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we are engaged in the research, development, manufacturing, sales and servicing of medium to large sized
projected capacitive touchscreens. We specialize in large-format touchscreens, which are developed and designed for a wide variety of
markets and used in the financial terminals, automotive, Point of Sales, gaming, lottery, medical, HMI, and other specialized industries. 

Our
product portfolio comprises medium to large sized projected capacitive touchscreens ranging from 7.0 inch to 42 inch screens. In terms
of the structures of touch panels, we offer (i) Glass-Glass GG ), primarily used in GPS/car entertainment panels in mid-size
and luxury cars, industrial HMI, financial and banking terminals, POS and lottery machines; (ii) Glass-Film-Film GFF ),
mostly used in high-end GPS and entertainment panels, industrial HMI, financial and banking terminals, lottery and gaming industry; (iii)
Plastic-Glass PG ), typically adopted by touchscreens in GPS/entertainment panels motor vehicle GPS, smart home, robots
and charging stations; and (iv) Glass-Film GF ), mostly used in industrial HMI. 

Maintaining
the industry standards for product quality and sustainability is one of our core values. Touchscreens produced by us not only have long
life span with low maintenance, but also have strong anti-interference and anti-corrosion solutions, coupled with multi-touch capability
and high light-transmittance ratio and stability. As a high technology company, our PRC subsidiary has received certifications from domestic
and international institutions, such as ISO9001 Quality Management Systems (QMS) Certification of Registration, ISO 14001 Environmental
Management System (EMS) Certification of Registration, and RoHS SGS Certification (Restriction of Hazardous Substance Testing Certification). 

We
generate revenues through sales of our various touchscreen products. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized
approximately 37.9 million and 40.8 million, respectively, in revenues. 

We
sell our touchscreen products both domestically in China and internationally, covering major areas in China, including but not
limited to the eastern, southern, northern and southwest regions of China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Germany. We believe that we have
established a strong and diversified client base. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our domestic sales accounted for
69.7 and 66.7 , respectively, of our revenues, and our international sales accounted for 30.3 and 33.3 , respectively, of our
revenues. 

Corporate
History 

We
were originally incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on August 31, 1992 as Gulf West Investment Properties, Inc, and were
dormant and had no operations for many years. 

On
February 26, 2019, the Eighth Judicial District Court in and for Clark County, Nevada, Case No. A-19-787151-B, appointed Custodian Ventures
LLC, an affiliate of David Lazar, as custodian of the Company (the Custodian ). Mr. Lazar was appointed as the sole officer
and director of the Company. On March 11, 2019, 1,714,286 shares of common stock of the Company were issued to the Custodian in consideration
for the payment of cash and the issuance of a promissory note by the Custodian to the Company. Effective as of June 11, 2019, the court
discharged the Custodian s duties. 

On
June 18, 2020, we consummated the transactions contemplated by a Stock Purchase Agreement among the Company, the Custodian, Qixun Samoa
and Qihong Samoa (Qixun Samoa and Qixun Samoa are referred to as the Buyers ). Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement,
the Buyers acquired all of the 1,714,286 shares of the Company owned by the Custodian, representing 50.47 of the issued and outstanding
shares of the Company. The Custodian and the Company agreed to indemnify the Buyers from any liabilities of the Company occurring prior
to June 18, 2020, and the promissory note issued by the Custodian to the Company was canceled. Immediately following the closing, David
Lazar resigned as the sole officer and director of the Company and Jiaying Cai was appointed as president, secretary and treasurer of
the Company and as the sole director.

Name
Change/Reverse Stock Split 

Effective
September 30, 2020, we changed our name from Gulf West Investment Properties, Inc. to Wetouch Technology Inc. by filing an Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to give effect to a name change. The Amended and Restated Articles
also effectuated a reverse split of our authorized, issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a 70 for 1 new basis whereby each
70 shares of outstanding common stock was exchanged for one (1) share of new common stock (the Reverse Split and, for avoidance
of doubt, all share amounts set forth herein shall be post Reverse Split unless otherwise specified) and, consequently, our authorized
common stock increased to 300,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and our then issued and outstanding
common shares decreased from 237,742,066 to 3,396,394 shares, all with a par value of 0.001. All share and per share numbers relating
to our common stock prior to the effectiveness of the Reverse Split have been adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Split. 

As
a result of the name change, we changed our trading symbol from GLFW to WETH, effective November 3, 2020. 

Acquisition
of BVI Wetouch 

On
October 9, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement with BVI Wetouch and all of
the BVI Wetouch Shareholders to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital stock of BVI Wetouch in exchange for the issuance to the
BVI Shareholders an aggregate of 28,000,000 shares of our common stock. In the Reverse Merger, each ordinary share of BVI Wetouch was
exchanged for 560 shares of common stock of Wetouch. Immediately after the closing of the Reverse Merger on October 9, 2020, we had a
total of 31,396,394 issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a result of the Reverse Merger, BVI Wetouch is now our wholly-owned
subsidiary. 

On
October 12, 2020, Guangde Cai was appointed as an additional director and Chairman of the Company. On October 12, 2020, Mr. Zongyi Lian
was appointed as president and chief executive officer of the Company, and Mr. Yuhua Huang was appointed as chief financial officer of
the Company. On the same day, Jiaying Cai resigned from the capacity of president and treasurer of the Company, but remains the secretary
and director of the Company. 

BVI
Wetouch was established under the laws of British Virgin Islands on August 14, 2020 to acquire all the shares of Hong Kong Wetouch Electronics
Technology Limited Hong Kong Wetouch ). On September 11, 2020, BVI Wetouch acquired all the outstanding shares of Hong
Kong Wetouch from the shareholders of Hong Kong Wetouch in consideration of HK 10,000 pursuant to instruments of transfer in accordance
with Hong Kong law. As a result of the acquisition, Hong Kong Wetouch became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BVI Wetouch. The shareholders
of Hong Kong Wetouch became the shareholders of BVI Wetouch in said transaction, and therefore the shareholders who controlled Hong Kong
Wetouch became the controlling shareholders of BVI Wetouch. 

Hong
Kong Wetouch was incorporated on May 5, 2016 under the laws of Hong Kong. On July 19, 2016, Hong Kong Wetouch acquired all the shares
of Sichuan Wetouch Technology Co., Ltd, a PRC company established in Meishan, Sichuan on May 6, 2011 Sichuan Wetouch ).
As a result of the acquisition, Sichuan Wetouch became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hong Kong Wetouch. 

As
BVI Wetouch owns all the outstanding shares of Hong Kong Wetouch, which, in turn, owns all the outstanding shares of Sichuan Wetouch,
the Company owns indirectly all the business of Sichuan Wetouch. As a result of the Reverse Merger in which the Company acquired all
the outstanding shares of BVI Wetouch, Hong Kong Wetouch and Sichuan Wetouch become our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

Acquisition
of HK Wetouch 

Hong
Kong Wetouch Technology Limited, a limited company organized under the laws of Hong Kong HK Wetouch ), an affiliate of
Guangde Cai, our former Chairman and Director, was incorporated on December 3, 2020 under the laws of Hong Kong. HK Wetouch was established
to own all the outstanding shares of Sichuan Vtouch Technology Co., Ltd., which was incorporated on December 30, 2020 Sichuan
Vtouch in Chengdu, Sichuan, under the laws of The People s Republic of China PRC ). 

On
March 12, 2021, BVI Wetouch, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, acquired all the outstanding shares of HK Wetouch from the
sole shareholder of HK Wetouch, Guangde Cai, in consideration of the payment of HK 10,000 pursuant to instruments of transfer in accordance
with Hong Kong law. As a result of the acquisition, HK Wetouch became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BVI Wetouch. BVI Wetouch owns (i)
all the outstanding shares of Hong Kong Wetouch, which, in turn, owns all the outstanding shares of Sichuan Wetouch and (ii) all of the
outstanding shares of HK Wetouch, which owns all the shares of Sichuan Vtouch.

Recent
Developments 

Leaseback Agreement 

Pursuant
to local PRC government guidelines on local environmental issues and the national overall plan, Sichuan Wetouch is under the government-directed
relocation order to relocate no later than December 31, 2021 and received compensation accordingly. 

On
March 16, 2021, Sichuan Wetouch entered into an Agreement of Compensation on Demolition Compensation Agreement with Meishan
Huantian Industrial Co., Ltd, formerly named Sichuan Renshou Shigao Tianfu Investment Co., Ltd, a limited company owned by the local
government Sichuan Renshou ), for the withdrawal of our right to use of state-owned land and the demolition of all buildings,
facilities and equipment on such land where we maintain our executive offices, research and development facilities and factories at No.29,
Third Main Avenue, Shigao Town, Renshou County, Meishan City, Sichuan, China (the Property ). The Property, all buildings,
facilities, equipment and all other appurtenances on the Property are collectively referred to as Properties . The Compensation
Agreement was executed and delivered as a result of guidelines (the Guidelines published by the local government of with
respect to local environmental issues and a national overall plan on Tianfu New District, Meishan City, Sichuan, PRC. In accordance with
the Guidelines, a project named Chaisang River Ecological Wetland Park is under construction in the areas where the manufacturing
facilities and properties of the Company are located. As a result, Sichuan Wetouch must relocate. In consideration for such relocation,
the owner of the buildings on the state-owned land will be compensated. 

In
order to minimize the interruption of our business, Sichuan Vtouch entered into a Leaseback Agreement with Sichuan Renshou on March 16,
2021. The Leaseback Agreement entitles us to lease back the Properties commencing from April 1, 2021 until December 31, 2021, at a monthly
rent of RMB300,000 (approximately 46,154), which period was extended to October 31, 2022. On October 16, 2022, Sichuan Vtouch entered
an extension to the Leaseback Agreement with Sichuan Renshou to extend the period it granted Sichuan Vtouch to lease back the Properties
until October 31, 2023, at a monthly rent of RMB400,000 (approximately 59,941). 

On
March 18, 2021, Sichuan Wetouch received a total amount of RMB115.2 million (approximately 17.7 million) as the total amount of compensation
from Sichuan Renshou, including RMB100.2 million 15.4 million) based upon the appraised value of the Properties plus an extra 15 relocation
bonus of RMB15.0 million 2.3 million). 

We
are actively searching for an appropriate parcel in Chengdu Medicine City (Technology Park), Wenjiang District, Chengdu for the construction
of our new production facilities and office buildings. As of the date of this Annual Report, we estimate that our capital needs for this
acquisition and construction will be approximately RMB170.0 million (approximately 26.2 million), but there is no assurance that the
estimated amount is sufficient to achieve our goals. We may need additional financing for our business development. In addition, we expect
that this acquisition and construction will be completed prior to October 31, 2023, but there is no assurance and we may need extended
time to achieve our business plan. Pursuant to local PRC government guidelines on local environment issues and the national overall plan,
Sichuan Wetouch was under the government directed relocation order to relocate no later than October 31, 2023 and was compensated for
RMB115.2 million 17.8 million) from the local government for the withdrawal of the right to use of state-owned land and the demolition
of all buildings, facilities, equipment and all other appurtenances on the land. 

On
March 2, 2021, HK Wetouch acquired all shares of Hong Kong Wetouch. On June 18, 2021, Hong Kong Wetouch submitted its application for
dissolution and was dissolved on March 18, 2022. In addition, as of March 31, 2021, Sichuan Wetouch s business and operations have
been assumed by Sichuan Vtouch.

aggregate of 15,889,371 shares of common stock of the Company. The registration statement was declared effective by the Commission on
January 7, 2021 (Registration No. 333-251845). 

3 

Private Sale of Shares 

On
January 19, 2023, we sold an aggregate of 160,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company for an aggregate purchase price of 40,000,000,
or 0.25 per share. The net proceeds of the offering (after deducting legal and accounting fees and expenses) shall be used by the Company
for working capital and general corporate purposes and the repayment of debt.

eighty (1:80), with the exact amount and the timing of the reverse stock split to be as determined by the Chairman of the Board. Upon
such reverse stock split becoming effective, the number of authorized shares of the common stock of the Company will also be decreased
in the same ratio.

Placement under the engagement between us and the Representatives. 

Effects
of COVID-19 

The
COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have affected our businesses, as well as those of our customers and suppliers significantly.
The spread of COVID-19 has caused significant disruption to society as a whole, including the workplace. The resulting impact on the
global supply chain has disrupted most aspects of national and international commerce, with government-mandated social distancing measures
imposing stay-at-home and work-from-home orders in almost every country. The effects of social distancing have shut down significant
parts of the local, regional, national, and international economies, for limited or extended periods of time, with the exception of government
designated essential services. 

Commencing
in the spring of 2021, China began to experience an increase of COVID-19 cases, and to some extent, local and national governments began
to take more restrictive measures to stem the spread of the virus, particularly from October to December 2021. The Company has several
shutdowns during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

To
serve our customers while also providing for the safety of our employees and service providers, we have modified numerous aspects of
our logistics, transportation, supply chain, purchasing, and after-sale processes. The Company has taken proactive measures to promote
products to new customers and entering more regions during the year ended December 31, 2022. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on
the Company s results of operations and financial condition will depend on the virus future developments, including the

Applications
of the Company s Products 

Our
products are used and applied in the production of a variety of products in a wide range of industries. Our products areas of
common application are set out below. 

Point
of Sale POS Machines 

POS
 machines, or point of sale machines, are used in a variety of retailers, including in department stores, supermarkets, convenience
 stores, boutiques, restaurants, hotels, banks, logistics, telecommunication and other service industries. Due to the frequent use
 of touchscreens on POS machines, Wetouch has adopted the use of high-end materials which give its products a competitive advantage
 through their anti-scratch, high temperature resistance and long use life qualities. 

Car
Navigators and Entertainment Systems 

Touchscreen
 products for car navigation and entertainment systems take advantage of the popularity of touchscreen consoles in motor vehicles.
 Wetouch touchscreens are particularly suitable for motor vehicles GPS and entertainment systems, due to their resistance to temperature
 variation. These touchscreens may be used in both inbuilt and external car systems. 

ATM
Machines and Other Financial Machines 

ATMs
 and other similar machines use touchscreens or have a touchscreen function. The touchscreens need to have high-endurance capacities
 as they are used by the general public and are often located outdoors, such that these screens must withstand weathering. Wetouch s
 products are particularly suited to use in these machines as they are highly durable. 

Industrial
Equipment 

Touchscreens
 in the industrial sector have broad application, and play an important role in industrial HMI. Industrial HMI systems and equipment
 often require touchscreen functions. These touchscreens must be resistant to interference, stable and have good touch sensitivity.
 Wetouch s products fully meet these requirements, being temperature variation resistant, dustproof and waterproof. 

Gaming
Machines 

The
 new generation of gambling machines are commonly adopting a touchscreen function. Gaming machines with a touchscreen function provide
 an enhanced experience for uses via multi-touch sensory touch systems. Wetouch s products are therefore popular amongst gambling
 machine manufacturers. 

6 

Lottery
Machines 

The
 self-service lottery ticket vending machine is provided with an operator-oriented touch display device, an input device, a modem,
 a cash register, printer and security authentication function. The touchscreen display facilitates easy and user-friendly operation
 of the lottery machine. 

Ticket
Machines and Kiosks 

Self-service
 ticket machines and kiosks contain touchscreen interfaces which are durable and have a long use life. These self-service machines
 are used in daily lives, and as such there is a continuous demand for high quality and effective touchscreens. Wetouch s products
 are widely used in these ticketing machines and kiosks.

For
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not provide any extended payment terms to any of our customers. Our customers are
required to make full payment within three to five months from delivery date, although our typical payment term is 180 days from delivery.
As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak in January 2020, collection activities from some of our customers affected by the pandemic resulted
in longer payment terms. We impliedly granted extended payment terms until December 31, 2020 to some of our customers. As of December
31, 2020, we collected all overdue accounts receivable by the end of this year and resumed our typical payment term. 

We
source our customers through multiple channels: (i) from our own research through Search Engine Optimization SEO and
outreach, (ii) through referrals from our present customers, (iii) through our websites; and (iv) through industry exhibitions/expos. 

Our
main target markets are economically developed countries and regions, including eastern, southern, northern and southwest regions of
China, South Korea, and Germany. We believe that we have established a strong client base, including global well-known institutional
customers. Overseas sales were 11.5 million in 2022 as compared to 13.6 million in 2021. 

We
target these overseas customers mainly via our online marketing efforts. In order to market our products, occupy more market share and
secure more quality customer, we frequently participate in, and promote our products at, specific touchscreen technology exhibitions
held internationally. 

In
addition to the top five (5) customers, we also have sales framework agreements with our major customers and direct purchase orders with
our other customers. In the past three years, we have entered into approximately 700 orders under both sales framework agreements and
through direct purchase orders. 

The
key terms of the framework agreements with our major customers have similar terms with our top five (5) customers as above mentioned.

The
products are inspected before they are delivered and sold to our customers. All products must pass the following inspections: 

Cosmetic
 inspection: conducted under optimum temperatures (20-22 degrees Celsius) and white fluorescent lighting. The product is observed
 by the naked eye to spot for any defects, scratches and cracks, panel discoloration, opacity, foreign fibers and spots. The Company
 has in place quantitative standards with respect to each of these areas to determine the level of cosmetic acceptability. 

11 

Function
 tests: all products undergo functionality testing. Touchscreen products are connected electronically via standard cabling systems
 to computers, to measure and test for effective functionality and to screen for any abnormalities. 

Stress
 testing: all products undergo product stress testing by being subject to humidity, temperature and corrosion stress testing. The
 products are tested for their functionality in high and low humidity environments as well as in extreme temperatures. The products
 are inspected to determine whether damage or physical change is caused by exposure to high and low temperatures. 

Third
 party organizations are engaged to conduct independent testing for hazardous substances. The products are also tested for their corrosive
 resistance to saline solutions. 

The
Company s products are produced to order and are marketed directly by its own sales personnel. The Company does not rely on distributors
to sell its products. 

Seasonality
of Business 

There
is no significant seasonality in our business. 

Inventory 

Inventory
consists of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Because a large percentage of the Company s orders require products
to be shipped in the same quarter in which the order was received, and because orders in the inventory may be canceled and delivery schedules
may be changed, the Company s inventory at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding
period. 

Research
and Development 

We
are committed to our own research and development projects as well as partnership initiatives in order to continuously and systematically
upgrade our touchscreen technology. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have 6 employees in our R D department. 

Intellectual
Property 

Our
business is dependent on a combination of trademarks, patents, domain names, trade names, trade secrets and other proprietary rights
in order to protect our intellectual property rights. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have one registered trademark in mainland
China and eight registered patents in the PRC under our former PRC subsidiary, Sichuan Wetouch.

Patents
registered in China cannot be enforced in other jurisdictions to which the Company supplies its products. We currently have registered
patents only in China. We plan to submit patent registration applications in our target market jurisdictions including United States,
Europe, Australia, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, India and Russia. The estimated costs for these patent registrations would be approximately
 160,000. We estimate that it may take two to three years to obtain the patent registrations in the above countries. 

Environmental
Issues 

Our
business in China is subject to various pollution control regulations in China with respect to noise, water and air pollution and the
disposal of waste. Specifically, the major environmental regulations applicable to us include the PRC Environmental Protection Law, the
PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, the PRC Law on
the Prevention and Control of Solid Waste Pollution, and the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution. 

Our
PRC subsidiary originally received Pollutant Discharge Permit from Renshou County environmental protection agency, which expired on May
15, 2019. Pursuant to a Statement on Change of Pollutant Discharge Permit to Stationary Pollution Source Registration Form dated September
1, 2020, the environmental protection system in Renshou County, Sichuan, was changed from permission to registration due to local administrative
division change. Therefore, upon submission of all required documentation, our PRC subsidiary is registered under the new system by issuance
of the Stationary Pollution Source Registration Form. 

The
Company is not aware of any investigations, prosecutions, disputes, claims or other proceedings in respect of environmental protection,
nor has the Company been punished or can foresee any punishment to be made by any environmental administration authorities of the PRC. 

Competitive
Strengths 

We
are dedicated to the production of high quality products that are tailored to customers requirements and commercial needs. Our
competitive strengths include:

 different applications. 

Our
Growth Strategies 

We
will continue to adhere to our business principles of providing high quality and safe products to our consumers and promoting social
responsibility. We believe that our pursuit of these goals will lead to sustainable growth driven by our capacity expansion based on
market demand, solidify our position in the industry, and create long-term value for our shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. 

Improve
 existing technology. We intend to improve our existing technology and occupy more market share. Our products are categorized
 into the following three main structures: GG (Glass + Glass), GFF (Glass + Film + Film), and PG(Plastic Glass). GG is mainly used
 in the automobile and banking and finance industries. We plan to make technological improvements on GG structure and mainly focus
 on improving its production capability and delivering quality products for brand customers. GFF is mostly applied in industrial HMI
 and lottery and gaming industries. We plan to continue to concentrate on high-end industrial HMI products. PG is primarily employed
 in smart home, robotics and charging stations industries. We plan to upgrade the production line of PG to improve its production
 capability and create greater adaptability to changes in product size. We have developed the industry 4.0 intelligent system, which
 is still under testing as of the date of this Annual Report. Upon successfully passing the testing phase and registering the patent,
 we plan to apply it to various manufacturing industries. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have sufficient funds to effectuate
 our plans. 

14 

Solidify
 our industry position by gaining additional market share . Our goal is to strengthen our market position and accelerate our
 expansion by expanding our scale and gaining additional market share. We plan to increase investment in our business and expand our
 production capacity through horizontal or vertical acquisitions, strategic partnerships and joint ventures. We plan to invest additional
 capital in technology research and development and acquiring new equipment to increase production capacity. In addition, we plan
 to participate in more expos or exhibitions domestically and internationally. With more exposure and promotion, we believe our product
 and brand will be better recognized. Currently we have no agreements or letters of intent for any acquisitions, partnerships or ventures. 

Uphold
 our commitment to product quality. We intend to uphold our commitment to product quality to ensure consistently high standards
 throughout our operations. We intend to achieve greater traceability of our products and maintain the highest quality standards in
 all of our business units. To this end, we plan to continue to maintain our quality monitoring systems across the entire operation
 by strictly selecting suppliers and meeting clients technology requirements, closely monitoring quality, keeping records of
 everyday operations, and complying with national and local laws and regulations on product quality, employees, and environment sustainability.
 We believe such practice largely conforms with the industry s best practices in China. 

Expand
 our sales and distribution network. We hope to expand our sales and distribution network to penetrate new geographic markets,
 further gaining market share in existing markets and accessing a broader range of customers. We will continue to expand our sales
 network, leveraging our local resources to quickly enter new markets, while also minimizing requirements for capital outlay. We plan
 to focus on brand clients and concentrate on high-end industry such as industrial HMI, banking and finance, medical instruments,
 military, aviation, and POS and increase our presence in both new and existing markets. 

Enhance
 our ability to attract, incentivize and retain talented professionals . We believe our success greatly depends on our ability
 to attract, incentivize and retain talented professionals. With a view to maintaining and improving our competitive advantage in
 the market, we plan to implement a series of initiatives to attract additional and retain mid- to high-level personnel, including
 formulating a market-oriented employee compensation structure and implementing a standardized multi-level performance review mechanism. 

Competition 

The
markets for touchscreen products are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. We believe that the principal competitive
factors in its markets are product characteristics such as touch performance, durability, optical clarity and price, as well as supplier
characteristics such as quality, service, delivery time and reputation. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors,
although there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to compete successfully in the future. 

Despite
that touchscreen products are highly competitive as a whole, we face fewer competitors, as we produce medium to large size touchscreens
which are specially tailored to certain industries, such as industrial HMI, gaming, financing, lottery, automotive, medical, and POS,
among others, and require more stable supply and longer guaranty and life span, compared with small size touchscreens, which are characterized
by shorter life cycles and guaranty but more demand in quantity. 

We
believe the following companies may be our competitors: 

Apex
 Material Technology Corp., founded in 1998, is committed to the development and innovation of resistive and projected capacitive
 (PCI or PCAP) total touch solutions. With its headquarter based in Keelung, Taiwan and a subsidiary located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
 it designs and manufactures advanced high-performance touch products for industrial and medical applications. Compared with us, although
 it has a longer history and geographical advantages, it mainly focuses on resistive touch panels and recently started production
 of capacitive touchscreens mostly applicable to the industrial HMI and medical industries, while our products are more widely used
 in a variety of industries. 

15 

Elo
 Touch Systems Inc., based and headquartered in the United States, has a history of over 40 years for the production of touchscreens.
 Its product portfolio includes a broad selection of interactive touchscreen displays from 10-70 inches, all-in-one touchscreen computers,
 OEM touchscreens and touchscreen controllers and touchscreen monitors. Compared with us, although it has a longer history and geographical
 advantages when it comes to the competition for U.S. customers and other international customers, it recently started the production
 of capacitive touchscreens mostly applicable to POS and inquiry machines, while our products are more widely used in a variety of
 industries. 

AbonTouch
 System Inc, established in 2005, mainly focuses on manufacturing and sales of mid to large size (7 ~86 Projective
 Capacitive Sensors, (7 ~21.5 Five-Wire Resistive Zero-Bezel Touch Panels and (5 ~21.5 Five-Wire Resistive Touch Panels. Compared with us, although it has a longer history and geographical advantages, it
 mainly focuses on resistive touch panels and recently started production of capacitive touchscreens mostly applicable to POS, inquiry
 machines and industrial HMI, while our products are more widely used in a variety of industries. 

Industry 

Since
inception, we have positioned ourselves in the professional touchscreen industry. Touchscreen is an input and output device and layered
on top of an electronic visual display of an information processing system, allowing individuals to access information and interact with
the device simply by touching the device s screen with a finger or a specialized tool. Accordingly, the ease of use offered by
touchscreen-based systems makes the systems well suited both for applications for the general public and for specialized applications
for institutional users and trained computer users. 

Although
touchscreen has become mainstream only over the last decade, the concept of a touch-sensitive computer display was developed as early
as 1965. Since the introduction of Apple s iPhone in 2007, touchscreen technology has made rapid inroads into various electronics
markets, with a number of other significant companies also incorporating this technology into their products (as opposed to using a mouse,
keyboard, keypad or trackball). Viewed today as the most important tool to facilitate interaction between the individual and machine,
touchscreen technology is now an integral part of a wide range of computing products. 

Regulations 

Overview 

We
operate our business in the PRC under a legal regime consisting of the National People s Congress, which is the country s
highest legislative body, the State Council, which is the highest authority of the executive branch of the PRC central government, and
several ministries and agencies under its authority, including the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, State Administration
for Market Regulation SAMR and their respective local offices. 

This
section sets forth a summary of the most significant rules and regulations that affect our business activities in the PRC. 

Regulations
Relating to Foreign Investment in China 

On
March 15, 2019, the National People s Congress promulgated the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect on January 1, 2020
and replaced three existing laws on foreign investments in China, namely, the PRC Equity Joint Venture Law, the PRC Cooperative Joint
Venture Law, and the Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The Foreign
Investment Law embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing
international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign- and domestic-invested
enterprises in China. The Foreign Investment Law establishes the basic framework for the access to, and the promotion, protection, and
administration of foreign investments in view of investment protection and fair competition. 

16 

Pursuant
to the Foreign Investment Law, foreign investment refers to investment activities directly or indirectly conducted by one
or more natural persons, business entities, or otherwise organizations of a foreign country within China, or foreign investors, and the
investment activities include the following situations: (i) a foreign investor, individually or collectively with other investors, establishes
an Foreign Investment Entity FIE in China; (ii) a foreign investor acquires stock shares, equity shares, shares in assets,
or other similar rights and interests of an enterprise within China; (iii) a foreign investor, individually or collectively with other
investors, invests in a new project in China; and (iv) investments in other means as provided by laws, administrative regulations, or
the State Council. 

Investment
activities in the PRC by foreign investors are principally governed by the Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment ,
or the Catalogue, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the Ministry of Commerce, or the MOFCOM, and the National
Development and Reform Commission, or the NDRC. Restricted and prohibited industries are listed in the Catalogue. The Catalogue sets
out a unified basis for the special administrative measures for foreign investment access. Fields not mentioned in the list for foreign
investment access, including touchscreen manufacturing, are administered under the principle of equal treatment for domestic and foreign
capital. 

Industries
not listed in the Catalogue are generally deemed as constituting a permitted category. According to the Catalogue, touchscreen
manufacturing is classified as industry where foreign investments are permitted. 

Furthermore,
the Foreign Investment Law provides that FIEs established according to the existing laws regulating foreign investment may maintain their
structure and corporate governance within five years after the implementation of the Foreign Investment Law. 

In
addition, the Foreign Investment Law also provides several protective rules and principles for foreign investors and their investments
in China, including, among others, that local governments must abide by their commitments to the foreign investors; FIEs are allowed
to issue stocks and corporate bonds; expropriation or requisition of the investment of foreign investors is prohibited except for special
circumstances, in which case statutory procedures must be followed and fair and reasonable compensation must be made in a timely manner;
mandatory technology transfer is prohibited; and the capital contributions, profits, capital gains, proceeds out of asset disposal, licensing
fees of intellectual property rights, indemnity or compensation legally obtained, or proceeds received upon settlement by foreign investors
in China may be freely remitted inward and outward in Renminbi or foreign currencies. Also, foreign investors or FIEs should be imposed
legal liabilities for failing to report investment information in accordance with the requirements. 

On
December 26, 2019, the PRC State Council approved the Implementation Rules of Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect on January
1, 2020. The Implementation Rules of Foreign Investment Law restates certain principles of the Foreign Investment Law and further provides
that, among others, (i) if the legal form or the governing structure of an FIE established prior to the effective date of the Foreign
Investment Law does not comply with the compulsory provisions of the PRC Company Law or the PRC Partnership Enterprises Law, such FIE
should complete amendment registration accordingly no later than January 1, 2025; if it fails to do so, the enterprise registration authority
will not process other registration matters of the FIE and may publicize such non-compliance; and (ii) the provisions regarding transfer
of equity interests, distribution of profits and remaining assets as stipulated in the joint venture contracts of an existing FIE may
survive the Foreign Investment Law during its joint venture term. 

17 

Regulations
on Environmental Protection 

Environmental
Protection Law 

The
 Environmental Protection Law of the PRC, or the Environmental Protection Law, was promulgated and effective on December 26, 1989,
and most recently amended on April 24, 2014, which amendments became effective January 1, 2015. This Environmental Protection Law has
been formulated for the purpose of protecting and improving both the living environment and the ecological environment, preventing and
controlling pollution, other public hazards and safeguarding people s health. 

According
to the provisions of the Environmental Protection Law , in addition to other relevant laws and regulations of the PRC, the Ministry
of Environmental Protection and its local counterparts take charge of administering and supervising said environmental protection matters.
Pursuant to the Environmental Protection Law , the environmental impact statement on any construction project must assess the pollution
that the project is likely to produce and its impact on the environment, and stipulate preventive and curative measures; the statement
shall be submitted to the competent administrative department of environmental protection for approval. Installations for the prevention
and control of pollution in construction projects must be designed, built and commissioned together with the principal part of the project. 

Permission
to commence production at or utilize any construction project shall not be granted until its installations for the prevention and control
of pollution have been examined and confirmed to meet applicable standards by the appropriate administrative department of environmental
protection that examined and approved the environmental impact statement. Installations for the prevention and control of pollution shall
not be dismantled or left idle without authorization. Where it is absolutely necessary to dismantle any such installation or leave it
idle, prior approval shall be obtained from the competent local administrative department of environmental protection. 

The
Environmental Protection Law makes it clear that the legal liabilities of any violation of said law include warning, fine, rectification
within a time limit, compulsory cease operation, compulsory reinstallation of dismantled installations of the prevention and control
of pollution or compulsory reinstallation of those left idle, compulsory shutout or closedown, or even criminal punishment. 

Order
on Ecosystem by The Ministry of Ecology and Environment 2019 Classification-based Management on Fixed Pollutant Source 

Pursuant
to the Order on Ecosystem by The Ministry of Ecology and Environment, which was issued on July 28, 2017 and most recently amended on
December 20, 2019, The Ministry of Ecology and Environment implements a classification-based management on the environmental impact assessment,
or EIA, of pollutants according to pollutant amount and the impact of the pollutants on the environment as below 

For
 those pollutant discharge units with large amount of pollutants and significant environmental impacts, the key management on a pollutant
 discharge permit is required; 

For
 those pollutant discharge units with small amount of pollutants and small environmental impacts, the simplified management on a pollutant
 discharge permit is required; and 

For
 those pollutant discharge units with very small amount of pollutants and very small environmental impacts, the pollutant discharge
 registration form is required. 

The
touchscreen manufacturing is classified as to fill in a Registration Form. Pursuant to a Statement on Change of Pollutant Discharge Permit
to Stationary Pollution Source Registration Form by the local government dated September 1, 2020, the environmental protection system
in Renshou County, Sichuan, was changed from permission to registration due to local administrative division change. Therefore, upon
submission of all required documentation, we are registered under the new system by filling in Stationary Pollution Source Registration
Form. 

Regulations
on Consumer Rights Protection 

Our
business is subject to a variety of consumer protection laws, including the PRC Consumer Rights and Interests Protection Law, which was
amended in 2013 and became effective on March 15, 2014. It imposes stringent requirements and obligations on business operators. Failure
to comply with these consumer protection laws could subject us to administrative sanctions, such as the issuance of a warning, confiscation
of illegal income, imposition of fines, an order to cease business operations, revocation of business licenses, and potential civil or
criminal liabilities. 

18 

As
of the date of this Annual Report, we are not aware of any warning, investigations, prosecutions, disputes, claims or other proceedings
in respect of customer rights protection, nor have we been punished or can foresee any punishment to be made by any government authorities
of the PRC. 

Regulations
on Intellectual Property Rights 

Regulations
on Trademark 

Trademarks
are protected by the PRC Trademark Law adopted in 1982 and subsequently amended as well as the Implementation Regulations for the Trademark
Law of the PRC in 2002 and subsequently amended in 2014 and 2019. The Trademark Office of the SAMR is responsible for the registration
and administration of trademarks and the Trademark Review and Adjudication Committee established by the SAMR is responsible for resolving
trademark disputes in China. Registered trademarks are valid for ten years from the date the registration is approved. A registrant may
apply to renew a registration within twelve months before the expiration date of the registration. If the registrant fails to apply in
a timely manner, a grace period of six additional months may be granted. If the registrant fails to apply before the grace period expires,
the registered trademark shall be deregistered. Renewed registrations are valid for ten years. In April 2014, the State Council issued
the revised Implementation of the Trademark Law, which specified the requirements of applying for trademark registration and review.
As of the date of this Annual Report, we had 1 registered trademark in China. 

Regulations
on Patent Law 

According
to the PRC Patent Law, which was issued by the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress in 1984 and last amended on
October 17, 2020, effective on June 1, 2021, and Implementation Rules of the Patent Law of the People s Republic of China, which
were promulgated by the State Council in 2001 and last amended on January 9, 2010. Draft amendments to the Implementation Rules of the
Patent Law are currently under review. The Patent Law and its implementation rules provide for three types of patents: invention, 
 utility model and design. Invention refers to any new technical solution relating to a product,
a process or improvement thereof; utility model refers to any new technical solution relating to the shape, structure,
or their combination, of a product, which is suitable for practical use; and design refers to any new design of the whole
or partial shape, pattern, color or the combination of any two of them, of a product, that creates an aesthetical feeling and is suitable
for industrial application. Invention patents are valid for 20 years, while design patents and utility model patents are valid for 15
years and 10 years, respectively, each calculated from the date of application. To be patentable, invention or utility models must meet
three criteria: novelty, inventiveness and practicability. Except under certain specific circumstances provided by law, any third-party
user must obtain consent or a proper license from the patent owner to use the patent. Otherwise, the use constitutes an infringement
of the patent rights. As of the date of this Annual Report, we had 8 registered patents under our former PRC subsidiary Sichuan Wetouch,
which we are in the process of assigning to our PRC subsidiary Sichuan Vtouch and 4 pending patents in China under our PRC subsidiary
Sichuan Vtouch. 

Regulations
on Foreign Exchange 

General
Administration of Foreign Exchange 

Under
the PRC Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated on January 29, 1996 and most recently amended on August 5, 2008 and various
regulations issued by the SAFE, and other relevant PRC government authorities, Renminbi is convertible into other currencies for current
account items, such as trade-related receipts and payments and payment of interest and dividends. The conversion of Renminbi into other
currencies and remittance of the converted foreign currency outside China for capital account items, such as direct equity investments,
loans, and repatriation of investment, requires the prior approval from the SAFE or its local office. 

Payments
for transactions that take place in China must be made in Renminbi. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies may not repatriate foreign
currency payments received from abroad or retain the same abroad. FIEs may retain foreign exchange in accounts with designated foreign
exchange banks under the current account items subject to a cap set by the SAFE or its local branch. Foreign exchange proceeds under
the current accounts may be either retained or sold to a financial institution engaged in settlement and sale of foreign exchange pursuant
to relevant SAFE rules and regulations. For foreign exchange proceeds under the capital accounts, approval from the SAFE is generally
required for the retention or sale of such proceeds to a financial institution engaged in settlement and sale of foreign exchange. 

19 

Pursuant
to the Circular of the SAFE on Notice of State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Improvements and Adjustments to Foreign
Exchange Control Policies for Direct Investment, which was promulgated on November 19, 2012, became effective on December 17, 2012, and
was further amended on May 4, 2015, October 10, 2018, and December 30, 2019, approval of the SAFE is not required for opening a foreign
exchange account and depositing foreign exchange into the accounts relating to the direct investments. This circular also simplifies
foreign exchange-related registration required for foreign investors to acquire equity interests of PRC companies and further improve
the administration on foreign exchange settlement for FIEs. 

The
Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Simplifying and Improving the Foreign Exchange Management Policies
for Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular 13, which became effective on June 1, 2015 and was amended on December 30, 2019, cancels the
administrative approvals of foreign exchange registration of direct domestic investment and direct overseas investment and simplifies
the procedure of foreign exchange-related registration. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 13, investors should register with banks for direct
domestic investment and direct overseas investment. 

The
Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital of Foreign-invested
Enterprises, which was promulgated on March 30, 2015, became effective on June 1, 2015, and was amended on December 30, 2019, provides
that an FIE may, according to its actual business needs, settle with a bank the portion of the foreign exchange capital in its capital
account for which the relevant foreign exchange administration has confirmed monetary capital contribution rights and interests (or for
which the bank has registered the injection of the monetary capital contribution into the account). Pursuant to this circular, for the
time being, FIEs are allowed to settle 100 of their foreign exchange capital on a discretionary basis; an FIE should truthfully use
its capital for its own operational purposes within the scope of its business; where an ordinary FIE makes domestic equity investment
with the amount of foreign exchanges settled, the FIE must first go through domestic re-investment registration and open a corresponding
account for foreign exchange settlement pending payment with the foreign exchange administration or the bank at the place where it is
registered. 

The
Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Policies for Reforming and Regulating the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement
under the Capital Account, which was promulgated and became effective on June 9, 2016, provides that enterprises registered in China
may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency into Renminbi on a self-discretionary basis. This circular also provides an
integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange under capital account items (including, but not limited to, foreign currency capital
and foreign debts) on a self-discretionary basis, which applies to all enterprises registered in China. 

On
January 26, 2017, SAFE promulgated the Notice of State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Improving the Check of Authenticity and
Compliance to further Promote Foreign Exchange Control, which stipulates several capital control measures with respect to the outbound
remittance of profit from domestic entities to offshore entities, including: (i) banks should check board resolutions regarding profit
distribution, the original version of tax filing records, and audited financial statements pursuant to the principle of genuine transactions;
and (ii) domestic entities should hold income to account for previous years losses before remitting the profits. Moreover, pursuant
to this circular, domestic entities should make detailed explanations of the sources of capital and utilization arrangements, and provide
board resolutions, contracts, and other proof when completing the registration procedures in connection with an outbound investment. 

On
October 25, 2019, the SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Promoting the Facilitation
of Cross-border Trade and Investment, which, among other things, allows all FIEs to use Renminbi converted from foreign currency-denominated
capital for equity investments in China, as long as the equity investment is genuine, does not violate applicable laws, and complies
with the negative list on foreign investment. However, since this circular is newly promulgated, it is unclear how the SAFE and competent
banks will carry it out in practice. 

20 

According
to the Regulations of the PRC on Administration of Company Registration, which were promulgated by the State Council on June 24, 1994,
became effective on July 1, 1994, and were amended on February 6, 2016, and other laws and regulations governing FIEs and company registrations,
the establishment of an FIE and any capital increase and other major changes in an FIE should be registered with the State Administration
for Market Regulation or its local counterparts and filed via the enterprise registration system. 

Pursuant
to SAFE Circular 13 and other laws and regulations relating to foreign exchange, when setting up a new FIE, the enterprise should register
with the bank located at its registered place after obtaining the business license, and if there is any change in capital or other changes
relating to the basic information of the FIE, including, without limitation, any increase in its registered capital or total investment,
the FIE must register such changes with the bank located at its registered place after obtaining approval from or completing the filing
with relevant authorities. Pursuant to the relevant foreign exchange laws and regulations, such foreign exchange registration with the
banks will typically take less than four weeks upon the acceptance of the registration application. 

Based
on the foregoing, if we intend to provide funding to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries through capital injection at or after their
establishment, we must register the establishment of and any follow-on capital increase in our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries with
the State Administration for Market Regulation or its local counterparts, file such via the enterprise registration system, and register
such with the local banks for the foreign exchange related matters. 

Regulations
on Offshore Financing 

Under
the Circular of the SAFE on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration over the Overseas Investment and Financing and Round-Trip
Investment by Domestic Residents via Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, effective on July 4, 2014, PRC residents are required
to register with the local SAFE branch prior to the establishment or control of an offshore special purpose vehicle, which is defined
as an offshore enterprise directly established or indirectly controlled by PRC residents for investment and financing purposes, with
the enterprise assets or interests PRC residents hold in China or overseas. The term control means to obtain the operation
rights, right to proceeds, or decision-making power of a special purpose vehicle through acquisition, trust, holding shares on behalf
of others, voting rights, repurchase, convertible bonds, or other means. At the same time, the SAFE has issued the Operation Guidance
for the Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration over Round-Trip Investment regarding the procedures for SAFE registration under
SAFE Circular 37, which became effective on July 4, 2014 as an attachment of SAFE Circular 37. 

The
PRC residents are also required to amend the registration or filing with the local SAFE branch any material change in the offshore company,
such as any change of basic information (including change of such PRC residents, name and operation term), increase or decreases in investment
amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or merger or divisions. On February 28, 2015, SAFE promulgated the Notice on Further Simplifying
and Improving Foreign Exchange Administration Policy on Direct Investment, or SAFE Notice 13, which became effective on June 1, 2015.
Pursuant to SAFE Notice 13, instead of applying for approvals regarding foreign exchange registrations of foreign direct investment and
overseas direct investment from SAFE as required under current laws, entities and individuals will be required to apply for such foreign
exchange registrations, including those required under the SAFE Circular 37, from qualified banks. The qualified banks, under the supervision
of SAFE, will directly examine the applications and conduct the registration. 

Failure
to comply with the registration procedures set forth in the SAFE Circular 37, or making misrepresentation on or failure to disclose controllers
of foreign-invested enterprise that is established through round-trip investment, may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign
exchange activities of the relevant onshore company, including the increase of its registered capital, the payment of dividends and other
distributions to its offshore parent or affiliate and the capital inflow from the offshore entities, and may also subject relevant PRC
residents to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations. PRC residents who directly or indirectly hold any shares
in our company from time to time are required to register with SAFE in connection with their investments in us. We have requested PRC
residents holding direct or indirect interest in our company to our knowledge to make the necessary applications, filings and amendments
as required under the SAFE Circular 37 and other related rules. 

21 

As
of the date of this Annual Report, the PRC residents have either not completed, or have not applied for, foreign exchange registration
under the SAFE Circular 37 and other related rules. Although they are either in the process of making foreign exchange registration or
plan to make foreign exchange registrations, they may still be faced with the above possible fines in accordance with the PRC Laws. 

Regulations
on Dividend Distribution 

The
principal laws and regulations regulating the distribution of dividends by FIEs in China include the PRC Company Law, as amended in 2004,
2005, 2013, and 2018, and the 2019 PRC Foreign Investment Law and its Implementation Rules. Under the current regulatory regime in China,
FIEs in China may pay dividends only out of their retained earnings, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and
regulations. A PRC company is required to set aside as statutory reserve funds at least 10 of its after-tax profit, until the cumulative
amount of such reserve funds reaches 50 of its registered capital unless laws regarding foreign investment provide otherwise. A PRC
company cannot distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years
may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year. 

We
currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our
business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, you should not rely on an investment
in our common stock as a source for any future dividend income. 

Regulation
on M A Rules and Overseas Listings 

In
August 2006, six PRC governmental agencies jointly promulgated the Provisions on Foreign-funded Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic
Enterprises, or the M A Rule, as most recently amended in 2009. The M A Rule requires offshore special purpose vehicles formed
to pursue overseas listing of equity interests in PRC companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals
to obtain the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special
purpose vehicle s securities on any stock exchange overseas. 

The
M A Rule further requires that the Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in
which a foreign investor acquires control of a PRC domestic enterprise or a foreign company with substantial PRC operations, if certain
thresholds under the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior Notification of Concentrations of Undertakings, issued by the State Council,
are triggered. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law promulgated by the Standing Committee of the NPC requires that transactions which are
deemed concentrations and involve parties with specified turnover thresholds be cleared by the MOFCOM before they can be completed. 

On
December 24, 2021, the CSRC issued the Provisions of the State Council on the Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing
by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments), or the Draft Overseas Listing Administration Provisions, and the Administrative Measures
for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments), or the Draft Overseas Listing
Filing Measures, which are open for public comments until January 23, 2022. 

On
February 17, 2023, with the approval of the State Council, the CSRC released the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities
Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the Trial Measures, and five supporting guidelines, which came into effect on March
31, 2023. According to the Trial Measures, (1) domestic companies that seek to offer or list securities overseas, both directly and indirectly,
should fulfill the filing procedure and report relevant information to the CSRC; (2) if the issuer meets both of the following conditions,
the overseas offering and listing shall be determined as an indirect overseas offering and listing by a domestic company: (i) any of
the total assets, net assets, revenues or profits of the domestic operating entities of the issuer in the most recent accounting year
accounts for more than 50 of the corresponding figure in the issuer s audited consolidated financial statements for the same period;
(ii) its major operational activities are carried out in China or its main places of business are located in China, or the senior managers
in charge of operation and management of the issuer are mostly Chinese citizens or are domiciled in China; and (3) where a domestic company
seeks to indirectly offer and list securities in an overseas market, the issuer shall designate a major domestic operating entity responsible
for all filing procedures with the CSRC, and where an issuer makes an application for initial public offering and listing in an overseas
market, the issuer shall submit filings with the CSRC within three business days after such application is submitted. 

22 

On
the same day, the CSRC held a press conference for the release of the Trial Measures and issued the Notice on Administration for the
Filing of Overseas Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, which, among others, clarifies that (1) a six-month transition period
will be granted to domestic companies which, prior to the effective date of the Trial Measures, have already obtained the approval from
overseas regulatory authorities or stock exchanges, such as completion of registration in the market of the United States, but have not
completed the indirect overseas listing; and (2) domestic companies that have already submitted valid applications for overseas offering
and listing but have not obtained approval from overseas regulatory authorities or stock exchanges on or prior to the effective date
of the Trial Measures, may reasonably arrange the timing for submitting their filing applications with the CSRC, and shall complete the
filing before the completion of their overseas offering and listing. 

Regulations
on Taxation 

Enterprise
Income Tax 

On
March 16, 2007, the National People s Congress promulgated the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, which was amended on February 24,
2017 and December 29, 2018. On December 6, 2007, the State Council enacted the Regulations for the Implementation of the Enterprise Income
Tax Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008 and amended on April 23, 2019. Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law and the relevant
implementation regulations, both resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises are subject to tax in China. Resident enterprises
are defined as enterprises that are established in China in accordance with PRC laws, or that are established in accordance with the
laws of foreign countries but are actually or in effect controlled from within China. Non-resident enterprises are defined as enterprises
that are organized under the laws of foreign countries and whose actual management is conducted outside China, but have established institutions
or premises in China, or have no such established institutions or premises but have income generated from inside China. Under the Enterprise
Income Tax Law and relevant implementing regulations, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 25 is applied. However, if non-resident
enterprises have not formed permanent establishments or premises in China, or if they have formed permanent establishment or premises
in China but there is no actual relationship between the relevant income derived in China and the established institutions or premises
set up by them, enterprise income tax is set at the rate of 10 with respect to their income sourced from inside the PRC. 

Value-Added
Tax 

The
PRC Provisional Regulations on Value-Added Tax were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993, which became effective on
January 1, 1994 and were subsequently amended from time to time. The Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the PRC Provisional Regulations
on Value-Added Tax (2011 Revision) was promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on December 25, 1993 and subsequently amended on December
15, 2008 and October 28, 2011. On November 19, 2017, the State Council promulgated the Decisions on Abolishing the PRC Provisional Regulations
on Business Tax and Amending the PRC Provisional Regulations on Value-Added Tax. Pursuant to these regulations, rules and decisions,
all enterprises and individuals engaged in sale of goods, provision of processing, repair, and replacement services, sales of services,
intangible assets, real property, and the importation of goods within the PRC territory are VAT taxpayers. On March 21, 2019, the Ministry
of Finance, the SAT, and the General Administration of Customs jointly issued the Announcement on Relevant Policies on Deepen the Reform
of Value-Added Tax. Sales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods, net of VAT. The VAT is based on gross sales price and VAT rates
range up to 17 , starting from May 1, 2018, VAT rate was lowered to 16 , and starting from April 1, 2019, VAT rate was further lowered
to 13 . 

23 

Dividend
Withholding Tax 

The
Enterprise Income Tax Law provides that since January 1, 2008, an income tax rate of 10 will normally be applicable to dividends declared
to non-PRC resident investors that do not have an establishment or place of business in China, or that have such establishment or place
of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends
are derived from sources within China. 

Pursuant
to the Arrangement Between the Mainland of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation
and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, and other applicable PRC laws, if a Hong Kong resident
enterprise is determined by the competent PRC tax authority to have met the relevant conditions and requirements under this arrangement
and other applicable laws, the 10 withholding tax on the dividends the Hong Kong resident enterprise receives from a PRC resident enterprise
may be reduced to 5 . However, based on the Circular on Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax
Treaties issued on February 20, 2009, if the relevant PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretions, that a company benefits from
such reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven, such PRC tax authorities may adjust the
preferential tax treatment. Pursuant to the Circular on Several Questions regarding the Beneficial Owner in Tax Treaties,
which was issued on February 3, 2018 by the SAT and became effective on April 1, 2018, when determining the applicant s status
as the beneficial owner regarding tax treatments in connection with dividends, interests, or royalties in the tax treaties,
several factors, including, without limitation, whether the applicant is obligated to pay more than 50 of his or her income in twelve
months to residents in third country or region, whether the business operated by the applicant constitutes the actual business activities,
and whether the counterparty country or region to the tax treaties does not levy any tax or grant any tax exemption on relevant incomes
or levy tax at an extremely low rate, will be taken into account, and such factors will be analyzed according to the actual circumstances
of the specific cases. This circular further provides that an applicant who intends to prove his or her status as the beneficial
owner must submit the relevant documents to the relevant tax bureau pursuant to the Announcement on Issuing the Measures for the
Administration of Non-Resident Taxpayers Enjoyment of the Treatment under Tax Agreements. 

Regulations
on Employment Laws 

In
accordance with the PRC National Labor Law, which became effective in January 1995 and amended from time to time, and the PRC Labor Contract
Law, which became effective in January 2008, as amended subsequently, employers must execute written labor contracts with full-time employees
in order to establish an employment relationship. All employers must compensate their employees equal to at least the local minimum wage
standards. All employers are required to establish a system for labor safety and sanitation, strictly abide by state rules and standards
and provide employees with appropriate workplace safety training. In addition, employers in China are obliged to pay contributions to
the social insurance plan and the housing fund plan for employees. 

Employees 

As
of the date of this Annual Report, we had 126 full-time employees. We have no part time employees or independent contractors. None of
our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced any work stoppage. We believe we have
good relations with our employees.

ITEM
 1A. 
 RISK
 FACTORS 

Investing
in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together
with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report, before deciding to invest in our securities. If any of the following
risks materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects will likely be materially and adversely affected.
In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 

24 

Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry 

The
current COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other epidemics, natural disasters, terrorist activities, political unrest, and other outbreaks
could disrupt our delivery and operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results
of operations. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, our revenues were approximately 37.9 million, a decrease of 2.9 million, or 7.1 , compared with
 40.8 million for year ended December 31, 2021. The current COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected many aspects of our business,
including production, supply chain, and sales and delivery. Our manufacturing facility underwent temporary yet prolonged closure in
February 2020 as part of China s nationwide efforts to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. Even though our business
is currently operational, our production capacity, delivery, warranty services including after-sale services and technical support,
and operational efficiency are still adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to insufficient workforce in production, sales,
and delivery as a result of temporary travel restrictions in China and the necessity to comply with disease control protocols in our
business establishments and manufacturing facility. Our suppliers abilities to timely deliver raw materials, parts and
components, or other services were also adversely affected for similar reasons. The global spread of COVID-19 may also affect our
overseas sales. As a result of varying levels of travel and other restrictions for public health concerns in various regions of
China, we also temporarily postponed the delivery of our products to our customers. While the duration of the impact of the pandemic
on our business and related financial impacts cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, our results of operations for the first
half of 2020 were adversely affected with potential continuing impacts on subsequent periods. In addition, further outbreaks of the
COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our PRC subsidiary s manufacturing ability, our PRC subsidiary s delivery and
after-sale services in China. COVID-19 has had a global economic impact on the financial markets. The global spread of COVID-19 pandemic may result in global
economic distress, and the extent to which it may affect our results of operations will depend on future developments, which are
highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. We cannot assure you that the COVID-19 pandemic can be eliminated or contained in the near
future, or at all, or a similar outbreak will not occur again. If the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting disruption to our business
were to extend over a prolonged period, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations. 

Global
pandemics, epidemics in China or elsewhere in the world, or fear of spread of contagious diseases, such as Ebola virus disease (EVD),
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 flu, H7N9
flu, and avian flu, as well as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, or other natural disasters could disrupt our business operations, reduce
or restrict our supply of products and services, incur significant costs to protect our employees and facilities, or result in regional
or global economic distress, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Actual or threatened war, terrorist activities, political unrest, civil strife, and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a similar
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any one or more of these events may impede our production
and delivery efforts and adversely affect our sales results, or even for a prolonged period of time, which could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We
are also vulnerable to natural disasters and other calamities. We cannot assure you that we are adequately protected from the effects
of fire, floods, typhoons, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, war, riots, terrorist attacks, or similar
events. Any of the foregoing events may give rise to interruptions, damage to our property, delays in production, breakdowns, system
failures, technology platform failures, or internet failures, which could cause the loss or corruption of data or malfunctions of our
manufacturing facility as well as adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

25 

We
are heavily dependent on our top customers. If we fail to acquire new customers or retain existing customers in a cost-effective manner,
our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

We
are heavily dependent on our top customers. We currently sell our products primarily through direct customers in the PRC and to some
extent, the overseas customers in European countries and East Asia such as South Korea and Taiwan. For the year ended December 31, 2022,
three customers accounted for 32.2 , 22.8 , and 14.0 of the total accounts receivable balance, respectively. For the year ended December
31, 2021, six customers accounted for 25.7 , 18.6 , 12.5 , 11.5 , 11.3 and 10.2 of the total accounts receivable balance, respectively. 

Our
ability to cost-effectively attract new customers and retain existing customers, especially our top customers, is crucial to driving
net revenues growth and achieving profitability. We have invested significantly in branding, sales and marketing to acquire and retain
customers since our inception. For example, we attend domestic and international expos and exhibitions in marketing our products and
attracting new customers. We also expect to continue to invest significantly to acquire new customers and retain existing ones, especially
our top customers. There can be no assurance that new customers will stay with us, or the net revenues from new customers we acquire
will ultimately exceed the cost of acquiring those customers. In addition, if our existing customers, especially our existing top customers
no longer find our products appealing, or if our competitors offer more attractive products, prices, discounts or better customer services,
our existing customers may lose interest in us, decrease their orders or even stop ordering from us. If we are unable to retain our existing
customers, especially our top customers or to acquire new customers in a cost-effective manner, our revenues may decrease and our results
of operations will be adversely affected. 

We
have a significant amount of accounts receivable, which could become uncollectible . 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 9.1 million in accounts receivable. Our accounts receivable primarily includes balance
due from customers when our products are sold and delivered to customers. Our customers are required to make full payment within
three to five months from delivery date, although our industry typical payment term is 180 days from delivery. As a result of the
COVID-19 outbreak in January 2020, collection activities from some of our customers affected by the pandemic resulted in longer
payment terms. We impliedly granted extended payment terms until December 31, 2020 to some of our customers. As of December 31,
2020, we collected all overdue accounts receivable and resumed our typical payment term. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and
2021, we did not provide any extended payment terms to any of our customers. Deteriorating conditions in, bankruptcies, or financial
difficulties of a customer or within their industries generally may impair the financial condition of our customers and hinder their
ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all, and accounts receivable are written off against allowances only after exhaustive
collection efforts. The failure or delay in payment by one or more of our customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely affect
our liquidity and results of operations. 

Failure
to maintain the quality and safety of our products could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and
results of operations. 

The
quality and safety of our products are critical to our success. We pay close attention to quality control, monitoring each step in the
process from procurement to production and from warehouse to delivery. Yet, maintaining consistent product quality depends significantly
on the effectiveness of our quality control system, which in turn depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to the design
of our quality control system, employee training to ensure that our employees adhere to and implement our quality control policies and
procedures and the effectiveness of monitoring any potential violation of our quality control policies and procedures. There can be no
assurance that our quality control system will always prove to be effective. 

In
addition, the quality of the products or services provided by our suppliers or service providers is subject to factors beyond our control,
including the effectiveness and the efficiency of their quality control system, among others. There can be no assurance that our suppliers
or service providers may always be able to adopt appropriate quality control systems and meet our stringent quality control requirements
in respect of the products or services they provide. Any failure of our suppliers or service providers to provide satisfactory products
or services could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operations. In addition, we may be unable to receive sufficient compensation
from suppliers and service providers for the losses caused by them. 

26 

We
face intense competition in the touchscreen industry in general. If we fail to compete effectively, we may lose market share and customers,
and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

The
touchscreen industry is intensely competitive in general. We face few competition as we produce medium to large size capacitive touchscreens
which are specially tailored to certain industries, such as industrial HMI, gaming, financing, lottery, automotive, medical, and POS,
etc., and requires more stable supply, longer guaranty and life span, compared with small size touchscreens which is characteristic with
shorter life cycle and guaranty but more demand in quantity. However, we still have some competitors competing in China and globally
with us. Our competitors may have more financial, technical, geographical advantage, marketing and other resources than we do and may
be more experienced and able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and support of their business. Some competitors
are well-established in China and globally and any defensive measures they take in response to our expansion could hinder our growth
and adversely affect our sales and results of operations. 

Furthermore,
increased competition may reduce our market share and profitability and require us to increase our sales and marketing efforts and capital
commitment in the future, which could negatively affect our results of operations or force us to incur further losses. Although we have
accumulated some and continuously growing our customer base, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future
against current or future competitors, and such competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

If
we do not obtain substantial additional financing, our ability to execute on our business plan may be impaired. 

Due
to the withdrawal of the land use right to the Property and cancellation of our ownership certificates pertaining to the buildings on
the Property by the local government pursuant to the Guidelines and the Compensation Agreement, we are actively searching for an appropriate
parcel in Chengdu Medicine City (Technology Park), Wenjiang District, Chengdu for the construction of our PRC subsidiary s new
production facilities and office buildings. As of the date of Annual Report, our management estimates that our capital needs for this
acquisition and construction will be approximately RMB170.0 million 26.2 million), but there is no assurance that the estimated amount
is sufficient to achieve our goals. We may need additional financing for our business development. 

In
addition, our plans call for significant new investments in research and development, marketing, expanded productions capacity, and working
capital for raw materials and other items. Should our capital needs be higher than our estimation, we will be required to seek additional
investments, loans or debt financing to fully pursue our business plans. Such additional investment may not be available to us on terms
which are favorable or acceptable. Should we be unable to meet our full capital needs, our ability to fully implement our business plan
will be impaired. 

Failure
to secure a new piece of parcel for the construction of our new buildings and facilities, and failure to acquire and install new production
lines on the new parcel, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

At
the year ended December 31, 2021, our use right to the Property was withdrawn by the local government and all ownership certificates
pertaining to the buildings on the Property were returned to the local government for cancellation. 

In
order to minimize the interruption of our business, Sichuan Vtouch entered into a Leaseback Agreement with Sichuan Renshou on March 16,
2021. The Leaseback Agreement entitles us to lease back the Properties commencing from April 1, 2021 until December 31, 2021, at a monthly
rent of RMB300,000 (approximately 46,154), which period was extended to October 31, 2022. On October 16, 2022, Sichuan Vtouch entered
an extension to the Leaseback Agreement with Sichuan Renshou to extend the period it granted Sichuan Vtouch to lease back the Properties
until October 31, 2023, at a monthly rent of RMB400,000 (approximately 59,941). 

As
of the date of this Annual Report, we are actively searching for an appropriate parcel in Chengdu Medicine City (Technology Park), Wenjiang
District, Chengdu for the construction of our new production facilities and office buildings. We estimate the new production lines and
construction of the new facilities and office buildings on the new parcel will be completed prior to October 31, 2023, but there is no
assurance and we may need extended time to achieve our business plan. If we fail to secure such construction prior to October 31, 2023
and the extended period, if any, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

27 

Any
adjustment of related party transaction pricing could lead to additional taxes, and therefore substantially reduce our consolidated net
income and the value of your investment. 

The
tax regime in China is rapidly evolving and there is significant uncertainty for taxpayers in China as PRC tax laws may be interpreted
in significantly different ways. The PRC tax authorities may assert that we or our subsidiaries owe and/or are required to pay additional
taxes on previous or future revenue or income. In particular, under applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations, arrangements and transactions
among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax authorities. If the PRC tax authorities determine that any
contractual arrangements were not entered into on an arm s length basis and therefore constitute a favorable transfer pricing,
the PRC tax liabilities of the relevant subsidiaries could be increased, which could increase our overall tax liabilities. In addition,
the PRC tax authorities may impose late payment interest. Our net income may be materially reduced if our tax liabilities increase. 

If
our preferential tax treatments and government subsidies are revoked or become unavailable or if the calculation of our tax liability
is successfully challenged by the PRC tax authorities, we may be required to pay tax, interest and penalties in excess of our tax provisions. 

The
Chinese government has provided tax incentives to our former subsidiary in China, Sichuan Wetouch, including reduced enterprise income
tax rates. For example, under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, the statutory enterprise income
tax rate is 25 . However, the income tax of an enterprise that has been determined to be a qualified enterprise located in western region
of PRC can be reduced to a preferential rate of 15 . The qualification of preferential tax rate is effective for a renewable three-year
permitted. As Sichuan Wetouch s business and operations have been assumed by our PRC subsidiary Sichuan Vtouch, Sichuan Vtouch
has reapplied for the preferential rate of 15 as a qualified enterprise. Such application is currently pending with the PRC tax authorities.
If our PRC subsidiary s application for the qualification of preferential tax rate benefit is not approved, our PRC subsidiary
will be subject to the statutory enterprise income tax rate of 25 . Further, in the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to
complex income tax and other tax regulations, and significant judgment is required in the determination of a provision for income taxes.
Although we believe our tax provisions are reasonable, if the PRC tax authorities successfully challenge our position and we are required
to pay tax, interest, and penalties in excess of our tax provisions, our financial condition and results of operations would be materially
and adversely affected. 

A
significant interruption in the operations of our third-party suppliers could potentially disrupt our operations. 

We
have limited control over the operations of our third-party suppliers and other business partners and any significant interruption in
their operations may have an adverse impact on our operations. For example, a significant interruption in the operations of our supplier s
manufacturing facilities could cause delay or termination of shipment of the raw materials to us, which may cause delay or termination
of shipment of our products to our customers, thus resulting in penalties or fines due to our breach of contract. If we could not solve
the impact of the interruptions of operations of our third-party suppliers, our business operations and financial results may be materially
and adversely affected. 

We
face the risk of fluctuations in the cost, availability and quality of our raw materials, which could adversely affect our results of
operations. 

The
cost, availability and quality of the raw materials, such as indium tin oxide glasses, panels, are important to our operations. If the
cost of raw materials increases due to large market price fluctuation or due to any other reason, our business and results of operations
could be adversely affected. Lack of availability of these raw materials, whether due to shortages in supply, delays or interruptions
in processing, failure of timely delivery or otherwise, could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results. 

28 

We
are dependent upon key executives and highly qualified managers and we cannot assure their retention. 

Our
success depends, in part, upon the continued services of key members of our management. Our executives and managers knowledge
of the market, our business and our Company represents a key strength of our business, which cannot be easily replicated. The success
of our business strategy and our future growth also depend on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate skilled managerial,
sales, administration, development and operating personnel. 

There
can be no assurance that our existing personnel will be adequate or qualified to carry out our strategy, or that we will be able to hire
or retain experienced, qualified employees to carry out our strategy. The loss of one or more of our key management or operating personnel,
or the failure to attract and retain additional key personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

We
do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers and they can reduce order quantities or terminate their sales to us at any time. 

Our
PRC subsidiary does not have long term contracts with our suppliers. At any time, our suppliers can reduce the quantities of products
they sell to us, or cease selling products to us altogether. Such reductions or terminations could have a material adverse impact on
our revenues, profits and financial condition. 

If
we fail to adopt new technologies to evolving customer needs or emerging industry standards, our business may be materially and adversely
affected. 

To
remain competitive, we must continue to stay abreast of the constantly evolving industry trends and to enhance and improve our technology
accordingly. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to identify, develop, acquire or license leading technologies useful in
our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to use new technologies effectively or meet customer s requirements.
If we are unable to adapt in a cost-effective and timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer preferences, whether
for technical, legal, financial or other reasons, our business may be materially and adversely affected. 

We
may experience significant liability claims or complaints from customers, or adverse publicity involving our products and our services. 

We
face an inherent risk of liability claims or complaints from our customers. We take our customers complaints seriously and endeavor
to reduce such complaints by implementing various remedial measures. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you that we can successfully prevent
or address all customer complaints. 

Any
complaints or claims against us, even if meritless and unsuccessful, may divert management attention and other resources from our business
and adversely affect our business and operations. Customers may lose confidence in us and our brand, which may adversely affect our business
and results of operations. Furthermore, negative publicity including but not limited to negative online reviews on social media and crowd-sourced
review platforms, industry findings or media reports related to safety and quality of our products, whether or not accurate, and whether
or not concerning our products, can adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation. 

PRC
regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident beneficial
owners or our PRC subsidiary to liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiary, limit our PRC subsidiary 
ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect us. 

In
July 2014, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents Offshore
Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, to replace the Notice on Relevant
Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Residents Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Offshore Special
Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 75, which ceased to be effective upon the promulgation of SAFE Circular 37. SAFE Circular 37 requires
PRC residents (including PRC individuals and PRC corporate entities) to register with SAFE or its local branches in connection with their
direct or indirect offshore investment activities. SAFE Circular 37 is applicable to our shareholders who are PRC residents and may be
applicable to any offshore acquisitions that we make in the future. 

29 

Under
SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who make, or have prior to the implementation of SAFE Circular 37 made, direct or indirect investments
in offshore special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, will be required to register such investments with SAFE or its local branches. In addition,
any PRC resident who is a direct or indirect shareholder of an SPV is required to update its filed registration with the local branch
of SAFE with respect to that SPV, to reflect any material change. Moreover, any subsidiary of such SPV in China is required to urge the
PRC resident shareholders to update their registration with the local branch of SAFE. If any PRC shareholder of such SPV fails to make
the required registration or to update the previously filed registration, the subsidiary of such SPV in China may be prohibited from
distributing its profits or the proceeds from any capital reduction, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV, and the SPV may also be
prohibited from making additional capital contributions into its subsidiary in China. On February 13, 2015, the SAFE promulgated a Notice
on Further Simplifying and Improving Foreign Exchange Administration Policy on Direct Investment, or SAFE Notice 13, which became effective
on June 1, 2015. Under SAFE Notice 13, applications for foreign exchange registration of inbound foreign direct investments and outbound
overseas direct investments, including those required under SAFE Circular 37, will be filed with qualified banks instead of SAFE. The
qualified banks will directly examine the applications and accept registrations under the supervision of SAFE. 

Some
of our shareholders that we are aware of are subject to SAFE regulations, and we expect all of these shareholders will have completed
all necessary registrations with the local SAFE branch or qualified banks as required by SAFE Circular 37. We cannot assure you, however,
that all of these shareholders may continue to make required filings or updates in a timely manner, or at all. We can provide no assurance
that we are or will in the future continue to be informed of identities of all PRC residents holding direct or indirect interest in our
company. Any failure or inability by such shareholders to comply with SAFE regulations may subject us to fines or legal sanctions, such
as restrictions on our cross-border investment activities or our PRC subsidiaries ability to distribute dividends to, or obtain
foreign exchange-denominated loans from, our company or prevent us from making distributions or paying dividends. As a result, our business
operations and our ability to make distributions to you could be materially and adversely affected. 

Furthermore,
as these foreign exchange regulations are still relatively new and their interpretation and implementation have been constantly evolving,
it is unclear how these regulations, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will be interpreted,
amended and implemented by the relevant government authorities. For example, we may be subject to a more stringent review and approval
process with respect to our foreign exchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign-currency-denominated borrowings,
which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we decide to acquire a PRC domestic company,
we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such company, as the case may be, will be able to obtain the necessary approvals or complete
the necessary filings and registrations required by the foreign exchange regulations. This may restrict our ability to implement our
acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects. 

As
of the date of this Annual Report, the PRC residents have either not completed, or have not applied for, foreign exchange registration
under the SAFE Circular 37 and other related rules. Although they are either in the process of making foreign exchange registration or
plan to make foreign exchange registrations, they may still face with the above said possible fines in accordance with the PRC Laws. 

We
have no business liability or disruption insurance, which could expose us to significant costs and business disruption. 

The
insurance industry in China is still at an early stage of development, and insurance companies in China currently offer limited business-related
insurance products. We do not have any business liability or disruption insurance to cover our operations. We have determined that the
costs of insuring for these risks and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make
it impractical for us to have such insurance. Any uninsured risks may result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources, which
could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

30 

We
may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance. 

While
we seek to maintain appropriate levels of insurance, not all claims are insurable and we may experience major incidents of a nature that
are not covered by insurance. We do not have other insurances that cover, among other things, employee-related accidents and injuries,
product or business liability and other property damage and liability deriving from our activities. Furthermore, insurance companies
in China currently do not offer as extensive an array of insurance products as insurance companies in more developed economies. We have
determined that the costs of insuring for these risks and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable
terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is adequate, but
there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurance coverage will be
sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all liabilities to which we may be subject. If we were to incur substantial
losses or liabilities due to fire, explosions, floods, other natural disasters or accidents or business interruption, our results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected. We could, for example, be subject to substantial claims for damages upon the occurrence
of several events within one calendar year. In addition, our insurance costs may increase over time in response to any negative development
in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. 

Risks
Related to Doing Business in China 

Adverse
regulatory developments in China may subject us to additional regulatory review and expose us to government restrictions, and additional
disclosure requirements and regulatory scrutiny to be adopted by the SEC in response to risks related to recent regulatory developments
in China may impose additional compliance requirements for companies with significant China-based operations, all of which could increase
our compliance costs, subject us to additional disclosure requirements, and/or suspend or terminate our future securities offerings,
making capital-raising more difficult. 

As
substantially all of our operations are based in China, we are subject to a wide range of relevant PRC laws. The recent regulatory developments
in China, in particular with respect to restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore and the government-led cybersecurity
reviews of certain companies, may lead to additional regulatory review in China over our financing and capital raising activities in
the United States. In addition, we may become subject to industry-wide regulations that may be adopted by the relevant PRC authorities,
which may have the effect of limiting our product and service offerings, restricting the scope of our operations in China, or causing
the suspension or termination of our business operations in China entirely, all of which will materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. We may have to adjust, modify, or completely change our business operations in response
to adverse regulatory changes or policy developments, and we cannot assure you that any remedial action adopted by us can be completed
in a timely, cost-efficient, or liability-free manner or at all. 

On
July 6, 2021, the relevant PRC government authorities published the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down Illegal Securities Activities
in Accordance with the Law. These opinions call for strengthened regulation over illegal securities activities and supervision on overseas
listings by China-based companies and propose to take effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems
to deal with the risks and incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed companies. On December 24, 2021, the CSRC released the Administrative
Provisions of the State Council Regarding the Overseas Issuance and Listing of Securities by Domestic Enterprises (Draft for Comments)
(the Draft Administrative Provisions and the Measures for the Overseas Issuance of Securities and Listing Record-Filings
by Domestic Enterprises (Draft for Comments) (the Draft Filing Measures , together with the Draft Administrative Provisions,
the Draft Rules ). The Draft Rules lay out the filing regulations for both direct and indirect overseas listings and clarify
the determination criteria for indirect overseas listings in overseas markets. Among other requirements, if a domestic enterprise intends
to indirectly offer and list securities in an overseas market, the record-filing obligation shall be completed within three working days
after the overseas listing application is submitted. On February 17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Trial Administrative Measures of
Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the Trial Administrative Measures ), which took effect
on March 31, 2023. The Trial Administrative Measures further stipulate the rules and requirements for overseas offering and listing conducted
by PRC domestic companies. Upon the effectiveness of the Trial Administrative Measures, we could be required to go through the filing
procedure. If required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete such process on time or at all. 

31 

On
July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments), or
the Measures, for public comments, which propose to authorize the relevant government authorities to conduct cybersecurity review on
a range of activities that affect or may affect national security, including listings in foreign countries by companies that possess
the personal data of more than one million users. On December 28, 2021, the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021 version) were promulgated
and will become effective on February 15, 2022 (the Measures ), which iterates that any online platform operators 
controlling personal information of more than one million users that seeks to list on a foreign stock exchange shall also be subject
to cybersecurity review. As we are neither an operator of critical information infrastructure nor a data processor 
carrying out data processing activities that affect or may affect national security, we believe that the Measures are not applicable
to us even after they take effect in current form. The PRC government is increasingly focused on data security, recently launching cybersecurity
review against a number of mobile apps operated by several US-listed Chinese companies and prohibiting these apps from registering new
users during the review period. There are great uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws, rules and regulations
regarding data and privacy security. We may be required to change our data and other business practices and be subject to regulatory
investigations, penalties, and increased cost of operations as a result of these laws and policies. 

On
July 30, 2021, in response to the recent regulatory developments in China and actions adopted by the PRC government, the Chairman of
the SEC issued a statement asking the SEC staff to seek additional disclosures from offshore issuers associated with China-based operating
companies before their registration statements will be declared effective, including whether the China-based operating company and the
issuer, when applicable, received or were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges and the risks that such
approval could be denied or rescinded. On August 1, 2021, the China Securities Regulatory Commission stated in a statement that it had
taken note of the new disclosure requirements announced by the SEC regarding the listings of Chinese companies and the recent regulatory
development in China, and that both countries should strengthen communications on regulating China-related issuers. We are subject to
a variety of PRC laws and may be subject to tightened regulatory review and exposed to government restrictions in China. In light of
the recent regulatory and policy developments in China and government actions taken by the PRC government, including possible imposition
of restrictions and/or approval requirements on China-based companies raising capital offshore, the offering of our securities may be
subject to additional disclosure requirements and review that the SEC or other regulatory authorities in the United States may adopt
for companies with China-based operations. 

Upon
the effectiveness of the Trial Administrative Measures, we could be subject to the Trial Administrative Measures, as the Company has:
(i) 50 or more of the issuer s operating revenue, total profit, total assets or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated
financial statements for the most recent accounting year is accounted for by PRC domestic companies; and (ii) the main parts of the issuer s
business activities are conducted in mainland China, or its main places of business are located in mainland China, or the senior managers
in charge of its business operation and management are mostly Chinese citizens or domiciled in mainland China; and, if required, we cannot
assure you that we will be able to complete such process on time or at all. 

On
February 17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic
Companies (the Trial Administrative Measures ), which took effect on March 31, 2023. Compared to the Draft Rules, the
Trial Administrative Measures further clarified and emphasized several aspects, including: (i) comprehensive determination of the
 indirect overseas offering and listing by PRC domestic companies in compliance with the principle of substance
over form and particularly, an issuer will be required to go through the filing procedures under the Trial Administrative
Measures if the following criteria are met at the same time: a) 50 or more of the issuer s operating revenue, total profit,
total assets or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent accounting year is
accounted for by PRC domestic companies, and b) the main parts of the issuer s business activities are conducted in mainland
China, or its main places of business are located in mainland China, or the senior managers in charge of its business operation and
management are mostly Chinese citizens or domiciled in mainland China; (ii) exemptions from immediate filing requirements for
issuers that a) have already been listed or registered but not yet listed in foreign securities markets, including U.S. markets,
prior to the effective date of the Trial Administrative Measures, and b) are not required to re-perform the regulatory procedures
with the relevant overseas regulatory authority or the overseas stock exchange, c) whose such overseas securities offering or
listing shall be completed before September 30, 2023. However, such issuers shall carry out filing procedures as required if they
conduct refinancing or are involved in other circumstances that require filing with the CSRC; (iii) a negative list of types of
issuers banned from listing overseas, such as issuers under investigation for bribery and corruption; (iv) regulation of issuers in
specific industries; (v) issuers compliance with national security measures and the personal data protection laws; and (vi)
certain other matters such as: an issuer must file with the CSRC within three business days after it submits an application for
initial public offering to competent overseas regulators; and subsequent reports shall be filed with the CSRC on material events,
including change of control or voluntary or forced delisting of the issuer(s) who have completed overseas offerings and listings.
According to the Relevant Officials of the CSRC Answered Reporter Questions CSRC Answers and Trial Administrative
Measures, upon effectiveness, as a company applying for listing on Nasdaq, we could be subject to the filing process since we have not
obtained the clearance from SEC or Nasdaq before the effective date of the Trial Administrative Measures. As the Trial Administrative Measures are newly issued, there remains uncertainty as to how it will be
interpreted or implemented. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will
be able to obtain clearance from the CSRC in a timely fashion or at all.

Recent
joint statement by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or the PCAOB, proposed rule changes submitted
by Nasdaq, and the newly enacted Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be
applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not
inspected by the PCAOB. These developments could add uncertainties to the trading of our common stock on U.S. stock exchanges, including
the possibility that our securities can be delisted if the PCAOB cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor. 

On
April 21, 2020, the SEC Chairman and PCAOB Chairman, along with other senior SEC staff, released a joint statement highlighting the risks
associated with investing in companies based in or have substantial operations in emerging markets including China. The joint statement
emphasized the risks associated with lack of access for the PCAOB to inspect auditors and audit work papers in China and higher risks
of fraud in emerging markets. 

On
May 18, 2020, Nasdaq filed three proposals with the SEC to (1) apply minimum offering size requirement for companies primarily operating
in Restrictive Market, (2) adopt a new requirement relating to the qualification of management or board of director for
Restrictive Market companies, and (3) apply additional and more stringent criteria to an applicant or listed company based on the qualifications
of the company s auditor. 

On
June 4, 2020, the U.S. President issued a memorandum ordering the President s working group on financial markets to submit a report
to the President within 60 days of the date of the memorandum that should include recommendations for actions that can be taken by the
executive branch and by the SEC or PCAOB to enforce U.S. regulatory requirements on Chinese companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges
and their audit firms. However, it remains unclear what further actions, if any, the U.S. executive branch, the SEC, and PCAOB will take
to address the problem. 

On
August 6, 2020, the President s working group released a report recommending that the SEC take steps to implement the five recommendations
outlined in the report. In particular, to address companies from jurisdictions that do not provide the PCAOB with sufficient access to
fulfill its statutory mandate, the President s working group recommended enhanced listing standards on U.S. stock exchanges. This
would require, as a condition to initial and continued exchange listing, PCAOB access to work papers of the principal audit firm for
the audit of the listed company. Companies unable to satisfy this standard as a result of governmental restrictions on access to audit
work papers and practices in their jurisdiction may satisfy this standard by providing a co-audit from an audit firm with comparable
resources and experience where the PCAOB determines it has sufficient access to audit work papers and practices to conduct an appropriate
inspection of the co-audit firm. The report permits the new listing standards to provide for a transition period until January 1, 2022
for listed companies, but would apply immediately to new listings once the necessary rulemakings and/or standard-setting are effective. 

On
August 10, 2020, the SEC announced that the SEC Chairman had directed the SEC staff to prepare proposals in response to the report of
the President s working group, and that the SEC was soliciting public comments and information with respect to the development
of these proposals. 

33 

On
May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the Act. The Act was approved by the U.S. House
of Representatives on December 2, 2020. On December 18, 2020, the Act was signed into public law by the President of the United States.
In essence, the Act requires the SEC to prohibit foreign companies from listing securities on U.S. securities exchanges if a company
retains a foreign accounting firm that cannot be inspected by the PCAOB for three consecutive years, beginning in 2021. On March 24,
2021, the SEC announced that it had adopted interim final amendments to implement congressionally mandated submission and disclosure
requirements of the Act. The interim final amendments will apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report
on Forms 10-K, 20-F, 40-F or N-CSR with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction
and that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that
jurisdiction. 

On
June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and on December 29, 2022 the Accelerating
Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was enacted, which amended the HFCA Act by requiring the SEC to prohibit an issuer s
securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for to two consecutive years instead
of three, thus reducing the time before our securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted. 

On
December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCA Act.
The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public
accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of
a position taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction. 

On
December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report on its determinations that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered
public accounting firms headquartered in China and in Hong Kong because of positions taken by PRC and Hong Kong authorities in those
jurisdictions. The PCAOB has made such designations as mandated under the HFCA Act. Pursuant to each annual determination by the PCAOB,
the SEC will, on an annual basis, identify issuers that have used non-inspected audit firms and thus are at risk of such suspensions
in the future. 

On
August 26, 2022, the SEC issued a statement announcing that the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol SOP with the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, and the Ministry of Finance of the People s Republic of China governing inspections
and investigations of audit firms based in China and Hong Kong, jointly agreeing on the need for a framework. 

On
December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it has secured complete access to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms
headquartered in Mainland China and Hong Kong and voted to vacate the previous Determination Report to the contrary. 

Our
auditor, the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report, as an auditor of companies that are traded publicly
in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States, pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts
regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. Our auditor is headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado
and has been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis. 

34 

PRC
regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion
may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of this offering to make loans or additional capital contributions to our Chinese subsidiaries,
which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. 

We
are an offshore holding company conducting our operations in China. We may make loans to our PRC subsidiaries to the approval, registration,
and filing with governmental authorities and limitation of amount, or we may make additional capital contributions to our wholly foreign-owned
subsidiaries in China. Any loans to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China, which are treated as foreign-invested enterprises
under PRC law, are subject to foreign exchange loan registrations. In addition, a foreign invested enterprise shall use its capital pursuant
to the principle of authenticity and self-use within its business scope. The capital of a foreign invested enterprise shall not be used
for the following purposes: (i) directly or indirectly used for payment beyond the business scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited
by relevant laws and regulations; (ii) directly or indirectly used for investment in securities or investments other than banks 
principal-secured products unless otherwise provided by relevant laws and regulations; (iii) the granting of loans to non-affiliated
enterprises, except where it is expressly permitted in the business license; and (iv) paying the expenses related to the purchase of
real estate that is not for self-use (except for the foreign-invested real estate enterprises). 

In
light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies,
we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals
or filings on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans by us to our Hong Kong or PRC subsidiaries or with respect to future
capital contributions by us to our Hong Kong or PRC subsidiaries. If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals,
our ability to use the proceeds from this offering and to capitalize or otherwise fund our Chinese operations may be negatively affected,
which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. 

Labor
laws in the PRC may adversely affect our results of operations. 

The
PRC National People s Congress promulgated the Labor Contract Law which became effective on January 1, 2008 and was amended on
December 28, 2012, and the State Council promulgated implementing regulations for the labor contract law on September 18, 2008. The labor
contract law and the implementing regulations impose requirements concerning, among others, the execution of written contracts between
employers and employees, the time limits for probationary periods, and the length of employment contracts. The interpretation and implementation
of these regulations are still evolving, our employment practices may violate the labor contract law and related regulations and we could
be subject to penalties, fines or legal fees as a result. If we are subject to severe penalties or incur significant legal fees in connection
with labor law disputes or investigations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 

Further,
the law requires certain terminations be based upon seniority and not merit. In the event that we decide to significantly change or decrease
our workforce, the Labor Contract Law could adversely affect our ability to enact such changes in a manner that is most advantageous
to our business or in a timely and cost-effective manner, thus materially and adversely affecting our financial condition and results
of operations. 

Non-compliance
with labor-related laws and regulations of the PRC may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation. 

We
have been subject to stricter regulatory requirements in terms of entering into labor contracts with our employees and paying various
statutory employee benefits, including pensions, housing fund, medical insurance, work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance
and childbearing insurance to designated government agencies for the benefit of our employees. Pursuant to the PRC Labor Contract Law,
or the Labor Contract Law, that became effective in January 2008 and its implementing regulations that became effective in September
2008 and was amended in July 2013, employers are subject to stricter requirements in terms of signing labor contracts, minimum wages,
paying remuneration, determining the term of employees probation and unilaterally terminating labor contracts. In the event that
we decide to terminate some of our employees or otherwise change our employment or labor practices, the Labor Contract Law and its implementation
regulations may limit our ability to effect those changes in a desirable or cost-effective manner, which could adversely affect our business
and results of operations. We believe our current practice complies with the Labor Contract Law and its amendments. However, the relevant
governmental authorities may take a different view and impose fines on us. 

As
the interpretation and implementation of labor-related laws and regulations are still evolving, we cannot assure you that our employment
practice does not and will not violate labor-related laws and regulations in China, which may subject us to labor disputes or government
investigations. If we are deemed to have violated relevant labor laws and regulations, we could be required to provide additional compensation
to our employees and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

35 

We
may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption law. 

We
are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of
payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute for the
purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We are also subject to Chinese anti-corruption laws, which strictly prohibit the payment
of bribes to government officials. We have operations, agreements with third parties, and make sales in China, which may experience corruption.
Our activities in China may create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one or more of the employees of our company,
because such employees might act against our policies, outside of our control. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption laws
may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business,
operating results and financial condition. In addition, the government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA
violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. 

Our
business may be materially and adversely affected if our PRC subsidiary declares bankruptcy or becomes subject to a dissolution or liquidation
proceeding. 

The
Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of the PRC, or the Bankruptcy Law, came into effect on June 1, 2007. The Bankruptcy Law provides that an enterprise
will be liquidated if the enterprise fails to settle its debts as and when they fall due and if the enterprise s assets are, or
are demonstrably, insufficient to clear such debts. 

Our
PRC subsidiaries hold certain assets that are important to our business operations. If our PRC subsidiaries undergo a voluntary or involuntary
liquidation proceeding, unrelated third-party creditors may claim rights to some or all of these assets, thereby hindering our ability
to operate our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

According
to the SAFE s Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration
Policies for Direct Investment, effective on December 17, 2012, and the Provisions for Administration of Foreign Exchange Relating to
Inbound Direct Investment by Foreign Investors, effective May 13, 2013, if our PRC subsidiary undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation
proceeding, prior approval from the SAFE for remittance of foreign exchange to our shareholders abroad is no longer required, but we
still need to conduct a registration process with the SAFE local branch. It is not clear whether registration is a mere
formality or involves the kind of substantive review process undertaken by SAFE and its relevant branches in the past. 

Changes
in China s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business
and operations. The PRC government has recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over overseas securities offerings
and other capital markets activities and foreign investment in China-based companies like us. Any such action, once taken by the PRC
government, could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause
the value of such securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become worthless. 

Substantially
all of our assets and operations are located in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects
may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally. The Chinese economy differs
from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement, level of development,
growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing
the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of
improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government.
In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. 

36 

The
PRC government has significant authority to exert influence on the ability of a China-based company, such as us, to conduct its business,
accept foreign investments or list on an U.S. or other foreign exchanges. For example, we face risks associated with regulatory approvals
of offshore offerings, anti-monopoly regulatory actions, as well as oversight on cybersecurity and data privacy. Such risks or any actions
by the PRC government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based
issuers could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our common stock or could significantly limit or completely
hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our common stock and/or other securities to investors and cause the value of such securities
to significantly decline or be worthless. The PRC government has significant authority, oversight and discretion over the conduct of
our business and may intervene with or influence our operations as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political
and societal goals. The PRC government has recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries such as the
education and internet industries, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies
regarding our industry that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the PRC
government has recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over overseas securities offerings and other capital
markets activities and foreign investment in China-based companies like us. Any such action, once taken by the PRC government, could
significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such
securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become worthless. 

The
Chinese government also exercises significant control over China s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment
of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or
companies. 

While
the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various
sectors of the economy. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in China, in the policies of the Chinese government or in the laws
and regulations in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China. Such developments could adversely
affect our business and operating results, lead to reduction in demand for our services and adversely affect our competitive position.
The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these
measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results
of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition, in
the past the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustment, to control the pace of economic
growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our business and operating results. 

Uncertainties
with respect to the PRC legal system, including uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws and sudden and unexpected changes in
laws and regulations in China, could adversely affect us and limit the legal protections available to you and us. 

Our
operations in China are governed by PRC laws and regulations. Our wholly foreign-owned PRC operating subsidiary Sichuan Vtouch is subject
to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China. The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes.
Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions under the civil law system may be cited for reference but have limited precedential
value. In addition, any new or changes in PRC laws and regulations related to foreign investment in China could affect the business environment
and our ability to operate our business in China. 

Since
the PRC legal system continues to evolve rapidly, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and
enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to us. Uncertainties
due to evolving laws and regulations could also impede the ability of a China-based company, such as our company, to obtain or maintain
permits or licenses required to conduct business in China. In the absence of required permits or licenses, governmental authorities could
impose material sanctions or penalties on us. In addition, some regulatory requirements issued by certain PRC government authorities
may not be consistently applied by other PRC government authorities (including local government authorities), thus making strict compliance
with all regulatory requirements impractical, or in some circumstances impossible. From time to time, we may have to resort to administrative
and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights. Any administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in
substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant
discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome
of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy than in more developed legal systems. These uncertainties
may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered into and could materially and adversely affect our business and results
of operations. 

37 

The
PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at
all and may have retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of any of these policies and rules until sometime
after the violation. Such unpredictability towards our contractual, property and procedural rights could adversely affect our business
and impede our ability to continue our operations. 

Furthermore,
if China adopts more stringent standards with respect to environmental protection or corporate social responsibilities, we may incur
increased compliance costs or become subject to additional restrictions in our operations. Intellectual property rights and confidentiality
protections in China may also not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. In addition, we cannot predict the effects
of future developments in the PRC legal system on our business operations, including the promulgation of new laws, or changes to existing
laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us and our investors,
including you. Moreover, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and
management attention. 

You
may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing actions in China against us
or our management based on foreign laws. 

We
are a company incorporated under the laws of the United States and we conduct substantially all of our operations in China. In addition,
our officers and directors reside within China and are PRC nationals. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process
upon us or those persons inside mainland China. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained in U.S.
courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors as none
of them currently resides in the United States or has substantial assets located in the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty
as to whether the courts of the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us or such persons predicated upon the
civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state. 

The
recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. PRC courts may recognize and enforce
foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based either on treaties between China and the
country where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other forms
of written arrangement with the United States that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. In addition,
according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, the PRC courts will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers
if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of PRC laws or national sovereignty, security or public interest. As a
result, it is uncertain whether and on what basis a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States. 

Government
control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment. 

The
PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi, or RMB, into foreign currencies and, in certain
cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive some revenue and incur some expenses in U.S. dollars but incur other expenses
primarily in RMB. Although our main business is based in mainland China or based in Hong Kong with our Chinese operating subsidiary,
some of our business may require us to use U.S. dollars. We choose quotations based on price competitiveness. Under existing PRC foreign
exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related
transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements.
Approval from appropriate government authorities is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out
of the PRC to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may, at its discretion,
impose restrictions on access to foreign currencies for current account transactions and if this occurs in the future, we may not be
able to pay in foreign currencies, and our business and operations may be adversely affected. 

38 

Fluctuations
in exchange rates could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment. 

The
value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political
and economic conditions in China and by China s foreign exchange policies. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old
policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar, and the Renminbi appreciated more than 20 against the U.S. dollar over
the following three years. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the
U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. Since June 2010, the Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly
and unpredictably. On November 30, 2015, the Executive Board of IMF completed the regular five-year review of the basket of currencies
that make up the Special Drawing Right, or the SDR, and decided that with effect from October 1, 2016, Renminbi is determined to be a
freely usable currency and will be included in the SDR basket as a fifth currency, along with the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Japanese
yen and the British pound. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Renminbi has depreciated significantly in the backdrop of a surging U.S.
dollar and persistent capital outflows of China. This depreciation halted in 2017, and the RMB appreciated approximately 7 against the
U.S. dollar during this one-year period. With the development of the foreign exchange market and progress towards interest rate liberalization
and Renminbi internationalization, the PRC government may in the future announce further changes to the exchange rate system, and we
cannot assure you that the Renminbi will not appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the future. It
is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the
U.S. dollar in the future. 

Significant
revaluation of the Renminbi may have a material and adverse effect on our operations. For example, to the extent that we need to convert
U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the
Renminbi amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose
of making payments for dividends on our shares of Common Stock or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against
the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. 

Very
limited hedging options are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into
any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging
transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to adequately hedge
our exposure or at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict
our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign currency. 

Governmental
control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively and affect the value of your investment. 

The
PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of
currency out of China. We receive substantially all of our revenues in Renminbi. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments
of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions,
can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. Specifically, under
the existing exchange restrictions, without prior approval of SAFE, cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiary in China
may be used to pay dividends to our company. However, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required
where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans
denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we need to obtain SAFE approval to use cash generated from the operations of our PRC
subsidiary to pay off their respective debt in a currency other than Renminbi owed to entities outside China, or to make other capital
expenditure payments outside China in a currency other than Renminbi. 

In
light of the flood of capital outflows of China, the PRC government may from time to time impose more restrictive foreign exchange policies
and step up scrutiny of major outbound capital movement. More restrictions and substantial vetting process may be required by SAFE or
other government authorities to regulate cross-border transactions falling under the capital account. The PRC government may at its discretion
restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future. If the foreign exchange control system prevents
us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign
currencies to our shareholders, including holders of our Common Stock. 

39 

Certain
political and economic considerations relating to the PRC could adversely affect our Company. 

While
the PRC s government has pursued economic reforms since its adoption of the open-door policy in 1978, a large portion of the PRC s
economy is still operating under five-year plans and annual state plans. Through these plans and other economic measures, such as control
on foreign exchange, taxation and restrictions on foreign participation in the domestic market of various industries, the PRC s
government exerts considerable direct and indirect influence on the economy. Many of the economic reforms carried out by the PRC s
government are unprecedented or experimental, and are expected to be refined and improved. Any readjustment process may not necessarily
have a positive effect on our operations or future business development. Our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in
the PRC s economic and social conditions as well as by changes in the policies of the PRC government, such as changes in laws and
regulations (or the official interpretation thereof), measures which may be introduced to control inflation, changes in the interest
rate or method of taxation, and the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion. 

The
Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities and may intervene or
influence our operations at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our common stock . 

The
Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through
regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those
relating to taxation, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. The central or respective local governments
may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts
on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. The Chinese government may intervene or influence our
operations at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our common stock. 

Failure
to comply with the Administrative Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange relating to the overseas direct investment or the engagement
in the issuance or trading of securities overseas by our PRC resident stockholders may subject such stockholders to fines or other liabilities. 

Other
than Notice 37, our ability to conduct foreign exchange activities in the PRC may be subject to the interpretation and enforcement of
the Implementation Regulations of the Administrative Measures for Individual Foreign Exchange promulgated by SAFE in January 2007 (as
amended and supplemented, the Administrative Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange ). Under the Administrative Measures
on Individual Foreign Exchange, any PRC individual seeking to make a direct investment overseas or engage in the issuance or trading
of negotiable securities or derivatives overseas must make the appropriate registrations in accordance with SAFE provisions. PRC individuals
who fail to make such registrations may be subject to warnings, fines or other liabilities. 

We
may not be fully informed of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. For example, because the investment in
or trading of our shares will happen in an overseas public or secondary market where shares are often held with brokers in brokerage
accounts, it is unlikely that we will know the identity of all of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. Furthermore, we have no
control over any of our future beneficial owners and we cannot assure you that such PRC residents will be able to complete the necessary
approval and registration procedures required by the Administrative Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange. 

It
is uncertain how the Administrative Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange will be interpreted or enforced and whether such interpretation
or enforcement will affect our ability to conduct foreign exchange transactions. Because of this uncertainty, we cannot be sure whether
the failure by any of our PRC resident stockholders to make the required registration will subject our PRC subsidiaries to fines or legal
sanctions on their operations, delay or restriction on repatriation of proceeds of securities offering into the PRC, restriction on remittance
of dividends or other punitive actions that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. 

40 

If
we are unable to obtain business insurance in the PRC, we may not be protected from risks that are customarily covered by insurance in
the United States. 

Business
insurance is not readily available in the PRC. To the extent that we suffer a loss of a type that would normally be covered by insurance
in the United States, such as product liability and general liability insurance, we would incur significant expenses in both defending
any action and in paying any claims that result from a settlement or judgment. We have not obtained fire, casualty and theft insurance,
and there is no insurance coverage for our raw materials, goods and merchandise, furniture or buildings in China. Any losses incurred
by us will have to be borne by us without any assistance, and we may not have sufficient capital to cover material damage to, or the
loss of, our production facility due to fire, severe weather, flood or other causes, and such damage or loss may have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, business and prospects. 

If
we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, such classification could result in unfavorable
tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders and the common stockholders. 

Under
the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with its de facto
 management body within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income
tax on its global income at the rate of 25 . The implementation rules define the term de facto management body as
the body that exercises full and substantial control and overall management over the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties
of an enterprise. In 2009, the State Administration of Taxation, or SAT, issued a circular, known as SAT Circular 82, which provides
certain specific criteria for determining whether the de facto management body of a PRC-controlled enterprise that
is incorporated offshore is located in China. Although this circular applies only to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises
or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the
SAT s general position on how the de facto management body text should be applied in determining the tax resident
status of all offshore enterprises. According to SAT Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise
or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its de facto management body 
in China, and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its global income only if all of the following conditions are met: (i)
the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; (ii) decisions relating to the enterprise s financial
and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii) the enterprise s
primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions are located or maintained in the PRC;
and (iv) at least 50 of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC. 

We
believe our Company, excluding our PRC subsidiaries, is not a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. However, the tax resident
status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation
of the term de facto management body. If the PRC tax authorities determine that our company is a PRC resident enterprise
for enterprise income tax purposes, we would be subject to PRC enterprise income on our worldwide income at the rate of 25 . Furthermore,
we would be required to withhold a 10 tax from dividends we pay to our shareholders that are non-resident enterprises. In addition,
non-resident enterprise shareholders (including the common stockholders) may be subject to PRC tax on gains realized on the sale or other
disposition of the common stock, if such income is treated as sourced from within the PRC. Furthermore, if we are deemed a PRC resident
enterprise, dividends paid to our non-PRC individual shareholders (including the common stock holders) and any gain realized on the transfer
of the common stock or ordinary shares by such shareholders may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 20 (which, in the case of dividends,
may be withheld at source by us). These rates may be reduced by an applicable tax treaty, but it is unclear whether non-PRC shareholders
of our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event
that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Any such tax may reduce the returns on your investment in our common stock. 

41 

The
PRC government may issue further restrictive measures in the future. 

We
cannot assure you that the PRC s government will not issue further restrictive measures in the future. The PRC government s
restrictive regulations and measures could increase our operating costs in adapting to these regulations and measures, limit our access
to capital resources or even restrict our business operations, which could further adversely affect our business and prospects. 

Interpretation
of PRC laws and regulations involve uncertainty. 

Our
business is conducted within China and is governed by the PRC s laws and regulations. The PRC s legal system is based on
written statutes, and prior court decisions can only be used as a reference. Since 1979, the PRC s government has promulgated laws
and regulations in relation to economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation
and trade, with a view to developing a comprehensive system of commercial law, including laws relating to property ownership and development.
However, due to the fact that these laws and regulations have not been fully developed, and because of the limited volume of published
cases and the non-binding nature of prior court decisions, interpretation of PRC s laws and regulations involves a degree of uncertainty.
Some of these laws may be changed without immediate publication or may be amended with retroactive effect. Depending on the government
agency or how an application or case is presented to such agency, we may receive less favorable interpretations of laws and regulations
than our competitors, particularly if a competitor has long been established in the locality of, and has developed a relationship with
such agency. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and
management attention. All of these uncertainties may cause difficulties in the enforcement of our land use rights, entitlements under
our permits and other statutory and contractual rights and interests. 

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock 

An
active trading market for our common stock may not develop, which may make it difficult for holders of our common stock to sell their
stock. 

Our
common stock currently trades on the OTCQB under the symbol WETH and currently there is minimal trading in our common stock.
Even assuming the uplisting of our common stock on Nasdaq, we can offer no assurances that trading in our stock will improve over time.
Such thin trading may make it more difficult for you to liquidate your holdings in our common stock or negatively affect the price per
share that you are able to realize from such sales, and we cannot assure you that a liquid public market for our common stock will develop.
An active trading market for our shares may never develop or be sustained following this offering. 

Further,
many brokerage firms will not process transactions involving low price stocks, especially those that come within the definition of a
 penny stock. If we cease to be quoted, holders of our common stock may find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain
accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock, and the market value of our common stock would likely decline. 

Since
our By-laws provide that the courts in the State of Nevada are the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us
and our shareholders, this could limit our shareholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our
directors or officers, or employees. 

Our
Amended and Restated By-laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the appropriate state
and federal courts in the State of Nevada shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf
of the Company, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company
to the Company or the Company s shareholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Nevada Revised
Statutes, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision would not apply to
suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal
courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims, Section 27 of the Exchange
Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the
rules and regulations thereunder. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over
all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Any person
or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our Company shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. 

42 

These
exclusive-forum provisions may limit a shareholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes
with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other
employees. 

Moreover,
if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Amended and Restated By-laws to be inapplicable or unenforceable
in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business,
results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result
in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. 

The
trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors. 

The
trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely due to factors beyond our control. This may happen
because of broad market and industry factors, including the performance and fluctuation of the market prices of other companies with
business operations located mainly in China that have listed their securities in the United States. In addition to market and industry
factors, the price and trading volume for our common stock may be highly volatile for factors specific to our own operations, including
the following: 

variations
 in our revenues, earnings and cash flow; 

announcements
 of new investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors; 

announcements
 of new offerings, solutions and expansions by us or our competitors; 

detrimental
 adverse publicity about us, our brand, our services or our industry; 

additions
 or departures of key personnel; and 

potential
 litigation or regulatory investigations. 

Any
of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our common stock will trade. 

In
the past, shareholders of public companies have often brought securities class action suits against those companies following periods
of instability in the market price of their securities. If we were involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount
of our management s attention and other resources from our business and operations and require us to incur significant expenses
to defend the suit, which could harm our results of operations. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our
reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be
required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Short
sellers of our stock may be manipulative and may drive down the market price of our common stock. 

Short
selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed or intends to borrow from a third
party with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date to return to the lender. A short seller hopes to profit from
a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the
short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller s interest
for the price of the stock to decline, some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, opinions or characterizations regarding
the relevant issuer, its business prospects and similar matters calculated to or which may create negative market momentum, which may
permit them to obtain profits for themselves as a result of selling the stock short. Issuers whose securities have historically had limited
trading volumes and/or have been susceptible to relatively high volatility levels can be particularly vulnerable to such short seller
attacks. 

The
publication of any such commentary regarding us by a short seller may bring about a temporary, or possibly long term, decline in the
market price of our common stock. No assurances can be made that we will not become a target of such commentary and declines in the market
price of our common stock will not occur in the future, in connection with such commentary by short sellers or otherwise. 

43 

In
connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, we identified
certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to develop and maintain an effective system
of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. 

The
SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring every public company to include a management
report on such company s internal controls over financial reporting, which contains management s assessment
of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. 

Our
reporting obligations as a public company place a significant strain on our management and operational and financial resources and systems.
Effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports
and are important to prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting
may result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn may harm our business and
negatively impact the trading price of our stock. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will continue to incur considerable costs and use
significant management time and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. 

In
connection with the auditing of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, we identified
the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: 

Inadequate
 segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; 

Lack
 of formal policies and procedures; 

Lack
 of a functioning audit committee and independent directors on the Company s board of directors to oversee financial reporting
 responsibilities; and 

Lack
 of risk assessment procedures on internal controls to detect financial reporting risks on a timely manner. 

As
defined in the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Management
has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness
are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions planned include: 

Continue
 to search for and evaluate qualified independent outside directors; 

Identify
 gaps in our skills base and the expertise of our staff required to meet the financial reporting requirements of a public company;
 and 

Continue
 to develop policies and procedures on internal control over financial reporting and monitor the effectiveness of operations on existing
 controls and procedures. 

We
have also engaged with a third-party financial consulting firm during the year to assist with the preparation of SEC reporting. We are
committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment, and believe that these remediation efforts will deliver improvements
in our control environment. Our management will continue to monitor and evaluate the relevance of our risk-based approach and the effectiveness
of our internal controls and procedures over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing
additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. 

44 

However,
the implementation of these measures may not fully address these weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and we
cannot conclude that they have been fully remedied. Our failure to correct these weakness and deficiencies or our failure to discover
and address any other weakness and deficiencies could result in our inability to accurately report our financial results, prevent or
detect fraud or provide timely and reliable financial and other information pursuant to the reporting obligations we have as a public
company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, it could
cause our investors to lose confidence in the information we report, which could adversely affect the price of our shares. 

We
are subject to the penny stock rules, which will make shares of our common stock more difficult to sell. 

We
are currently subject to the SEC s penny stock rules as our shares of common stock sell below 5.00 per share. Penny
stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than 5.00. The penny stock rules require broker-dealers to deliver a standardized
risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny
stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation
of the broker-dealer and its salesperson, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s
account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally
or in writing prior to completing the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation. 

In
addition, the penny stock rules require that, prior to a transaction, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that
the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. The
penny stock rules are burdensome and may reduce purchases of any offerings and reduce the trading activity for shares of our common stock.
As long as our shares of common stock are subject to the penny stock rules, the holders of such shares of common stock may find it more
difficult to sell their securities. 

If
we become directly subject to the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to
expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business, operations and reputations, which could
result in a loss of your investment in our common stock. 

U.S.
public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative
publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative
publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting,
inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in some cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the
scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in
value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement
actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny,
criticism and negative publicity will have on our business. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations
are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend the Company.
This situation may be a major distraction to our management. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, our company and business
operations will be severely hampered and your investment in our shares could be rendered worthless. 

The
sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect their market price. 

Sales
of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely
affect the market price of our common stock and could materially impair our ability to raise capital through equity offerings in the
future. Shares held by our existing shareholders may be sold in the public market in the future subject to the restrictions in Rule
144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act. We cannot predict what effect, if any, market sales of securities held by our significant
shareholders or any other shareholder or the availability of these securities for future sale will have on the market price of our
common stock. 

45 

Because
we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, you must rely on a price appreciation of our common stock for return on
your investment. 

We
currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our
business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, you should not rely on an investment
in our common stock as a source for any future dividend income. 

Our
board of directors has complete discretion as to whether to distribute dividends., Even if our board of directors decides to declare
and pay dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on our future results of operations and cash
flow, our capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by us from our subsidiaries, our financial
condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Accordingly, the return on your investment
in our common stock will likely depend entirely upon any future price appreciation of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our
common stock will appreciate in value, or even maintain the price at which you purchased the common stock. You may not realize a return
on your investment in our common stock and you may even lose your entire investment in our common stock. 

If
relations between the United States and China worsen, our stock price may decrease and we may have difficulty accessing the U.S. capital
markets. 

At
various times during recent years, the United States and China have had disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies
may arise in the future between these two countries. Any political or trade conflicts between the United States and China could adversely
affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to access U.S. capital markets. 

General
Risk Factors 

Our
operating history may not be indicative of our future growth or financial results and we may not be able to sustain our historical growth
rates. 

Our
operating history may not be indicative of our future growth or financial results. There is no assurance that we will be able to grow
in future periods. Our growth rates may decline for any number of possible reasons and some of them are beyond our control, including
decreasing customer demand, increasing competition, declining growth of the touchscreen industry in general, emergence of alternative
business models, or changes in government policies or general economic conditions. We will continue to expand our sales network and product
offerings to bring greater convenience to our customers and to increase our customer base and number of transactions. However, the execution
of our expansion plan is subject to uncertainty and the total number of items sold and number of transacting customers may not grow at
the rate we expect for the reasons stated above. If our growth rates decline, investors perceptions of our business and prospects
may be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline. 

Economic
recessions could have a significant, adverse impact on our business. 

Our
revenues are generated from sales of our capacitive touchscreen products both domestically and internationally and we anticipate that
revenues from such sales will continue to represent the substantial portion of our total revenues in the near future. Our sales and earnings
can also be affected by changes in the general economy. 

The
touchscreen industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession, downturns in
business cycles of our customers, interest rate fluctuations, and other economic factors beyond our control. Deterioration in the economic
environment subjects our business to various risks, which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us
to not reach our long-term growth goals. For example, a downturn in the economy could directly affect the discretionary spending power
of our customers and in turn, depress the number of orders for our products. 

46 

We
may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may be expensive to defend and may disrupt our business and operations. 

We
cannot be certain that our operations or any aspects of our business do not or will not infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual
property rights held by third parties. We have not but in the future may be, subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the
intellectual property rights of others. There could also be existing intellectual property of which we are not aware that our products
may inadvertently infringe. We cannot assure you that holders of intellectual property purportedly relating to some aspect of our technology
or business, if any such holders exist, would not seek to enforce such intellectual property against us in China, or any other jurisdictions.
If we are found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others, we may be subject to liability for our infringement activities
or may be prohibited from using such intellectual property, and we may incur licensing fees or be forced to develop alternatives of our
own. In addition, we may incur significant expenses, and may be forced to divert management s time and other resources from our
business and operations to defend against these infringement claims, regardless of their merits. Successful infringement or licensing
claims made against us may result in significant monetary liabilities and may materially disrupt our business and operations by restricting
or prohibiting our use of the intellectual property in question, and our business, financial position and results of operations could
be materially and adversely affected. 

Further,
the application and interpretation of China s patent laws and the procedures and standards for granting patents in China are still
evolving and are uncertain, and we cannot assure you that PRC courts or regulatory authorities would agree with our analysis. 

We
may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position. 

We
regard our trademark, patents, know-how, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. We may
become an attractive target to intellectual property attacks in the future with the increasing recognition of our brand. Any of our intellectual
property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated, or such intellectual property may not be sufficient
to provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, there can be no assurance that (i) all of our intellectual property rights will
be adequately protected, or (ii) our intellectual property rights will not be challenged by third parties or found by a judicial authority
to be invalid or unenforceable. 

Changes
in U.S. and international trade policies, particularly with regard to China, may adversely impact our business and operating results. 

The
U.S. government has recently made statements and taken certain actions that may lead to potential changes to U.S. and international trade
policies, including recently-imposed tariffs affecting certain products manufactured in China. It is unknown whether and to what extent
new tariffs (or other new laws or regulations) will be adopted, or the effect that any such actions would have on us or our industry
and customers. Although cross-border business may not be an area of our focus, if we plan to sell our products internationally in the
future, any unfavorable government policies on international trade, such as capital controls or tariffs, may affect the demand for our
products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries.
If any new tariffs, legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or, in particular,
if the U.S. government takes retaliatory trade actions due to the recent U.S.-China trade tension, such changes could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations.

Management s
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ).
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company is based upon, and should be read
in conjunction with, the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Overview 

We
were originally incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada in August 1992. On October 9, 2020, we entered into a share exchange
agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement with Wetouch Holding Group Limited, a British Virgin Islands BVI company incorporated on August 14, 2020 under the laws of the British Virgin Islands BVI Wetouch ), and all the shareholders
of BVI Wetouch (each a Shareholder and collectively the Shareholders ), to acquire all the issued and outstanding
capital stock of BVI Wetouch in exchange for the issuance to the Shareholders an aggregate of 28 million shares of our common stock (the
 Reverse Merger ). The Reverse Merger closed on October 9, 2020. Immediately after the closing of the Reverse Merger, we
had a total of 31,396,394 issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a result of the Reverse Merger, BVI Wetouch is now our wholly-owned
subsidiary. 

Through
our wholly-owned subsidiaries, BVI Wetouch, HK Wetouch, Sichuan Vtouch and Sichuan Wetouch, we are engaged in the research, development,
manufacturing, sales and servicing of medium to large sized projected capacitive touchscreens, which constitutes our source of revenues.
We are specialized in large-format touchscreens, which are developed and designed for a wide variety of markets and used in by the financial
terminals, automotive, POS, gaming, lottery, medical, HMI, and other specialized industries. Our product portfolio comprises medium to
large sized projected capacitive touchscreens ranging from 7.0 inch to 42 inch screens. In terms of the structures of touch panels, we
offer (i) Glass-Glass GG ), primarily used in GPS/car entertainment panels in mid-size and luxury cars, industrial HMI,
financial and banking terminals, POS and lottery machines; (ii) Glass-Film-Film GFF ), mostly used in high-end GPS and
entertainment panels, industrial HMI, financial and banking terminals, lottery and gaming industry; (iii) Plastic-Glass PG ),
typically adopted by touchscreens in GPS/entertainment panels motor vehicle GPS, smart home, robots and charging stations; and (iv) Glass-Film GF ), mostly used in industrial HMI. The following discussion and analysis pertain financial condition and results of operations
of our subsidiaries Hong Kong Wetouch, Sichuan Wetouch and Sichuan Vtouch for the years ended December 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Effects
of COVID-19 

The
COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have affected our businesses, as well as those of our customers and suppliers significantly.
The spread of COVID-19 has caused significant disruption to society as a whole, including the workplace. The resulting impact on the
global supply chain has disrupted most aspects of national and international commerce, with government-mandated social distancing measures
imposing stay-at-home and work-from-home orders in almost every country. The effects of social distancing have shut down significant
parts of the local, regional, national, and international economies, for limited or extended periods of time, with the exception of government
designated essential services. 

Commencing
in the spring of 2021, China began to experience an increase of COVID-19 cases, and to some extent, local and national governments began
to take more restrictive measures to stem the spread of the virus, particularly from October to December 2021. The Company has several
shutdowns during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

To
serve our customers while also providing for the safety of our employees and service providers, we have modified numerous aspects of
our logistics, transportation, supply chain, purchasing, and after-sale processes. The Company has taken proactive measures to promote
products to new customers and entering more regions during the year ended December 31, 2022. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on
the Company s results of operations and financial condition will depend on the virus future developments, including the
duration and spread of the outbreak and the impact on the Company s customers, which are still uncertain and cannot be reasonably
estimated at this point of time.

Revenues
were 37.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 2.9 million, or 7.1 , compared with 40.8 million in the same
period of last year. This was mainly due to the decrease of 0.3 in sales volume, and a decrease of 2.7 in the average selling price
of our products in RMB, and 4.4 negative impact from exchange rate due to depreciation of RMB against US dollars, as compared with those
of the same period of last year.

(i)
Domestic market 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue from domestic market decreased by 0.8 million or 2.8 , as a combined result of (i) a decrease
of 2.6 in the average selling price of our products in RMB, and (ii) 4.4 negative impact from exchange rate due to depreciation of
RMB against US dollars, and offset by (iii) an increase of 4.1 in sales volume, as compared with those of last year. 

As
for the RMB selling price, the decrease of 2.6 was mainly due to the marketing initiatives to enhance sales of new models of higher-end
products such as touch screens used in POS touchscreens, medical touchscreens and gaming touchscreens in marketing regions such as East
China during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

The
weakening in macroeconomic conditions since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic continued to exacerbate the touch screen business environment.
Since April 2022, the Chinese government has imposed strict zero tolerance virus policies and the Company s business has been negatively
impacted and has continued to generate lower revenues during the year ended December 31, 2022. Although the Company has taken proactive
efforts to market new models such as POS touchscreens and obtain new customers and penetrate into new regions with a sales increase of
0.8 in Eastern China, the Company had hard suffering of a decrease of 1.6 in Southwest China, and of 0.5 in Southern China due to
the government lockdown in this region during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

(ii)
Overseas market 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue from overseas market was 11.5 million as compared to and 13.6 million of the same period
of 2021, a decrease of 2.1 million or 15.4 , mainly due to a decrease of 8.3 in sales volume primarily due to 1) the slack overseas
orders; 2) negative effects of COVID 19 impact, such as more strict customs inspection in China leading to delayed product shipment during
the second half of 2022, and a decrease of 7.8 in average selling price of our products due to the decreased higher pricing medical
touchscreens during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with those of the same period of last year.

The
Company continued to shift production mix from traditional lower-end products such as touchscreens used in automotive to high-end products
such as touchscreens used in POS touchscreens and multi-functional printer touchscreens, primarily due to (i) greater growth potential
of computer screen models in China, and (ii) the stronger demand and better quality demand from consumers recognition of higher-end
touchscreens made with better raw materials.

same period of 2021. 

Our
PRC subsidiaries had 51.2 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022, which are planned to be indefinitely reinvested
in PRC. The distributions from our PRC subsidiary are subject to the U.S. federal income tax at 21 , less any applicable foreign tax
credits. Due to our policy of indefinitely reinvesting our earnings in our PRC business, we have not provided for deferred income tax
liabilities related to PRC withholding income tax on undistributed earnings of our PRC subsidiaries. 

Net
Income 

As
a result of the above factors, we had a net income of 8.7 million the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net income of 17.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Historically,
our primary uses of cash have been to finance working capital needs. We expect that we will be able to meet our needs to fund operations,
capital expenditures and other commitments in the next 12 months primarily with our cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows and
bank borrowings. 

We
may, however, require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions or other future developments. If these sources
are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility.
The sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities could result in additional dilution to stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness
would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict operations.
Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had current assets of 62.2 million, consisting of 51.3 million in cash, 9.1 million in accounts receivable,
 0.4 million in inventories, and 1.5 million in prepaid expenses other current assets. Our current liabilities as of December 31, 2022,
were 4.0 million, which is comprised of 1.4 million in accounts payable, 0.9 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities,
 0.4 million loan from a third party, and 1.3 million convertible promissory notes payable.

the year ended December 31, 2022 , (iii) the increase of 6.5 million account receivable due to slower collection from the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic and Sichuan Wetouch settling customer receivables during the year ended December 31, 2021; partially offset by
(iv) the increase of 0.8 million of account payable due to the longer payment period (v) 7.6 million gain on asset disposal for the
year ended December 31, 2021, (vi) the decrease of 3.1 million prepaid expenses including amortization of 1.0 million prepaid marketing
expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022; (vii) 0.5 million of deferred income due to Sichuan Wetouch write-off government grant
in the operating ceasing process for the year ended December 31, 2021.

for year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 5 in the interim financial information. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash used in the financing activities was 0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, including 1.4 million of repayment of convertible
promissory note payable (see Note 9 (a)), partially offset by 0.4 million loan from a third party. 

Net
cash provided by the financing activities was 1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of proceeds of 2.0 million
from issuance of seven convertible promissory notes, partially offset by the payment of issue cost of 0.2 million related to notes financing
(see Note 11). 

As

The
majority of the Company s revenues and expenses were denominated primarily in Renminbi RMB ), the currency of the
People s Republic of China. There is no assurance that exchange rates between the RMB and the U.S. Dollar will remain stable. Inflation
has not had a material impact on the Company s business. 

Our
industry typical payment term is 180 days. Accounts receivables are written off against the allowances only after exhaustive collection
efforts. 

Based
on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities and financing
activities will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations
for at least the next 12 months. 

COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES 

Legal
Proceedings 

From
time to time, the Company is a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues costs associated
with these matters when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss
contingencies are expensed as incurred. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had several legal claims or litigations. As of the date of this Annual Report, all actions have been settled
and Sichuan Wetouch, Hong Kong Wetouch and Mr. Guangde Cai were unconditionally and fully discharged and released therefrom. For a discussion of the Company s
legal proceedings, see Note 13 to the Financial Statements in Item 8 . 

Capital
expenditure commitment 

On
December 20, 2021, the Company entered into a contract with Shenzhen Municipal Haoyutuo Decoration Cleaning Engineering Company
Limited to purchase a facility decoration contract of RMB20.0 million (equivalent to US 3.1 million). As of December 31, 2022, the Company
has prepaid RMB15.0 million (equivalent to US 2.2 million) and recorded as construction in progress (see Note 5) and had a remaining
balance of RMB5.0 million (equivalent to US 0.7 million) to be paid by the end of 2023. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

There
were no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

An
accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are
highly uncertain at the time such estimate is made, and if different accounting estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes
in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. 

We
prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. We continually
evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experiences and various
other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the
financial reporting process, actual results could differ from our expectations as a result of changes in our estimates. Some of our accounting
policies require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application and require us to make significant accounting estimates. 

The
following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes and other disclosures included in this registration statement. When reviewing our financial statements,
you should consider (i) our selection of critical accounting policies, (ii) the judgments and other uncertainties affecting the application
of such policies and (iii) the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. 

58 

Revenue
recognition 

The
Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of
this standard did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. Therefore, no adjustments to opening
retained earnings were necessary. 

ASC
606, Revenue from Contracts with customers, establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty
of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity s contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires
an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. 

ASC
606 requires the use of a five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires that the Company
(i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction
price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate
the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies
the performance obligation. The application of the five-step model to the revenue streams compared to the prior guidance did not result
in significant changes in the way the Company records its revenue. The Company has assessed the impact of the guidance by reviewing its
existing customer contracts and current accounting policies and practices to identify differences that would result from applying the
new requirements, including the evaluation of its performance obligations, transaction price, customer payments, transfer of control
and principal versus agent considerations. Based on the assessment, the Company concluded that there was no change to the timing and
pattern of revenue recognition for its current revenue streams. 

In
accordance to ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when it transfers its goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in such exchange. The Company accounts for the revenue generated from sales
of its products primarily to its customers in PRC and overseas, as the Company is acting as a principal in these transactions, is subject
to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices, and is responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide customers the specified
goods, which the Company has control of the goods and has the ability to direct the use of goods to obtain substantially all the benefits.
All of the Company s contracts have one single performance obligation as the promise is to transfer the individual goods to customers,
and there is no separately identifiable other promises in the contracts. The Company s revenue streams are recognized at a point
in time when title and risk of loss passes and the customer accepts the goods, which generally occurs at delivery. The Company s
products are sold with no right of return and the Company does not provide other credits or sales incentive to customers. The Company s
sales are net of value added tax VAT and business tax and surcharges collected on behalf of tax authorities in respect
of product sales. 

Contract
Assets and Liabilities 

Payment
terms are established on the Company s pre-established credit requirements based upon an evaluation of customers credit
quality. Contract assets are recognized for in related accounts receivable. Contract liabilities are recognized for contracts where payment
has been received in advance of delivery. The contract liability balance can vary significantly depending on the timing when an order
is placed and when shipment or delivery occurs. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, other than accounts receivable and advances from customers,
the Company had no other material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on its consolidated balance
sheet. Costs of fulfilling customers purchase orders, such as shipping, handling and delivery, which occur prior to the transfer
of control, are recognized in selling, general and administrative expense when incurred. 

The
Company generally warrants that its products will substantially conform to the agreed-upon specifications for three years from the date
of shipment. The Company s liability is limited to either a credit equal to the purchase price or replacement of the defective
part. Returns, after sales services and technical support under warranty have historically been immaterial. As such, the Company does
not record a specific warranty reserve or consider activities related to such warranty, if any, to be a separate performance obligation. 

59 

Disaggregation
of Revenues 

The
Company disaggregates its revenue from contracts by geography, as the Company believes it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing
and uncertainty of the revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The Company s disaggregation of revenues for the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are disclosed in Note 14 to the financial statements. 

Use
of estimates 

In
preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP ), management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. These estimates are based on information as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates
required to be made by management include, but are not limited to, the allowance for estimated uncollectible receivables, inventory valuations,
useful lives of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, the recoverability of long-lived assets, provision necessary for contingent
liabilities, revenue recognition and realization of deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Inventories 

Inventory
consists of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined
using a weighted average. For work-in-process and manufactured inventories, cost consists of raw materials, direct labor and an allocated
portion of the Company s production overhead. The Company writes down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable
value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. For finished goods and work-in-process, if the estimated net
realizable value for an inventory item, which is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predicable
costs to completion and disposal, is lower than its cost, the specific inventory item is written down to its estimated net realizable
value. Net realizable value for raw materials is based on replacement cost. Provisions for inventory write-downs are included in the
cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Inventories are carried at this lower cost basis until sold or scrapped.
 74,100 and nil inventory write-off was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Convertible
Promissory Notes 

The
Company accounts for its convertible promissory notes according to guidance of ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and
Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting
for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity , which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments
by eliminating the requirement to separate embedded conversion features from the host contract when the conversion features are not required
to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815. 

We
analyze the convertible notes for the existence of a beneficial conversion feature. the Company considered the three characteristics
of a derivative instrument listed in ASC 815-10-15-83: (i) having one or more underlyings and one or more notional amounts or payment
provisions or both; (ii) requiring no initial net investment; and (iii) permitting net settlement. 

Since
the Company s notes have fixed interest rate, specified notional principal and settlement date, which no other events would affect
specified settlement, and the Company received net proceeds after issuance costs and discount, which the Company recorded as the net
proceeds or net settled investment, the management assessed that the Notes did not do not meet the definition of a derivative instruments
and an embedded feature would not be bifurcated. The discounts on the convertible notes, are amortized to interest expense, using the
effective interest method, over the terms of the related convertible notes. 

60 

Common
stock purchase warrants 

The
Company also analyzed the Warrants in accordance with ASC 815, to determine whether the Warrants meet the definition of a derivative
and, if so, whether the Warrants meet the scope exception of ASC 815-40, which is that contracts issued or held by the reporting entity
that are both (1) indexed to its own stock and (2) classified in stockholders equity shall not be considered to be derivative
instruments for purposes of ASC 815-40. 

The
Company concluded that the Warrants issued in November and December 2021 financing should be treated as a derivative liability because
the Warrants are entitled to a price adjustment provision to allow the exercise price to be increased or reduced in the event the Company
issues or sells any additional shares of common stock at a price per share more or less than the then-applicable exercise price or without
consideration, which is typically referred to as a Down-round protection or anti-dilution provision. According
to ASC 815-40, the Down-round protection provision is not considered to be an input to the fair value of a fixed-for-fixed
option on equity shares which leads the Warrants to fail to be qualified as indexed to the Company s own stock and then to fail
to meet the scope exceptions of ASC 815. Therefore, the Company accounted for the Warrants as derivative liabilities under ASC 815. Pursuant
to ASC 815, derivatives are measured at fair value and re-measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings at each
reporting period. 

The
Company used a black-scholes-pricing model to estimate the fair values of common stock purchase warrants at the balance sheet dates.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded 256,957 and 1,128,635 common stock purchase warrants liability, respectively,
and 871,677 and 759,471 gain on change of fair value of common stock purchase liability warrants for the year ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively. 

Income
taxes 

The
Company accounts for current income taxes in accordance with the laws of the relevant tax authorities. Deferred income taxes are recognized
when temporary differences exist between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period including the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary,
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 

An
uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax
examination. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized on examination.
For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. Penalties and interest incurred
related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the period incurred. No significant penalties or interest
relating to income taxes have been incurred during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company does not believe there was
any uncertain tax provision at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

The
Company s operating subsidiaries in China are subject to the income tax laws of the PRC. No significant income was generated outside
the PRC for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022, all of the Company s tax returns of its
PRC Subsidiaries remain open for statutory examination by PRC tax authorities.

for maintenance and repairs, which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets, are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures
for major renewals and betterments which substantially extend the useful life of assets are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated
depreciation of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated
statements of income and other comprehensive income in other income or expenses. 

Impairment
of long-lived Assets 

Long-lived
assets, such as property, plant and equipment, land use rights, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of a long-lived asset or asset group to be held and used
is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected
to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future
cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or
asset group. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values
and third party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of carrying amount or
fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. No impairment of long-lived assets was recognized for any of the years
presented. 

Share-Based
Compensation 

The
Company awards share options and other equity-based instruments to its employees, directors and third party service providers (collectively
 share-based payments ). Compensation cost related to such awards is measured based on the fair value of the instrument on
the grant date. The Company recognizes the compensation cost over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange
for the award, which generally is the vesting period. The amount of cost recognized is adjusted to reflect the expected forfeiture prior
to vesting. When no future services are required to be performed by the employee in exchange for an award of equity instruments, and
if such award does not contain a performance or market condition, the cost of the award is expensed on the grant date. The Company recognizes
compensation cost for an award with only service conditions that has a graded vesting schedule on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period for the entire award, provided that the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any date at least equals
the portion of the grant-date value of such award that is vested at that date. 

Comprehensive
income 

Comprehensive
income (loss) consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income (loss). The foreign currency translation gain or
loss resulting from translation of the financial statements expressed in RMB to US is reported in other comprehensive income (loss)
in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. 

Recently
issued accounting guidance 

The
Company considers the applicability and impact of all accounting standards updates ASUs ). Management periodically reviews
new accounting standards that are issued. 

62 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06 ASU 2020-06 Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options
(Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible
Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity. ASU 2020-06 will simplify the accounting for convertible instruments
by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting
models results in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current U.S.
GAAP. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are
not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception
from derivative accounting, and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded
as additional paid-in capital. ASU 2020-06 also amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity s
own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. For public business entities, the amendments in ASU 2020-06 are
effective for public entities which meet the definition of a smaller reporting company are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application
of the guidance will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2021. 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), which introduces new guidance for the
accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope. The new guidance introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate
credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities
and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. The
pronouncement will be effective for public business entities that are SEC filers in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application of the guidance will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the modified
retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

In
December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . The
amendment simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating some exceptions to the general approach in ASC 740, Income Taxes.
It also clarifies certain aspects of the existing guidance to promote more consistent application, among other things. The guidance is
effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning within 2021 with early adoption permitted. 

In
October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, which will require companies to apply the definition of a performance obligation under
ASC Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenue) relating to contracts with customers
that are acquired in a business combination. Under current U.S. GAAP, an acquirer generally recognizes assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and contract liabilities arising from revenue contracts with customers,
at fair value on the acquisition date. ASU No. 2021-08 will result in the acquirer recording acquired contract assets and liabilities
on the same basis that would have been recorded by the acquiree before the acquisition under ASC Topic 606. ASU No. 2021-08 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
this ASU on its financial statements and the effects will be based upon the contract assets and liabilities acquired in the future. 

From
time to time, the FASB or other standards setting bodies issue new accounting pronouncements. Updates to the FASB ASCs are communicated
through issuance of ASUs. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the recently issued guidance, whether adopted or to be
adopted in the future, is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks 

Interest
Rate Risk 

Our
exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to the interest income generated by excess cash, which is mostly held in interest-bearing
bank deposits. Interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. We have not been exposed to material risks due to changes
in interest rates, and we have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest risk exposure. 

Foreign
Currency Exchange Rates 

The
some of our revenues are collected in and our expenses are paid in RMB. We face foreign currency rate translation risks when our results
are translated to U.S. dollars. 

The
RMB was relatively stable against the U.S. dollar at approximately 8.28 RMB to the US 1.00 until July 21, 2005 when the Chinese currency
regime was altered resulting in a 2.1 revaluation versus the U.S. dollar. From July 21, 2005 to September 30, 2010, the RMB exchange
rate was no longer linked to the U.S. dollar but rather to a basket of currencies with a 0.3 margin of fluctuation resulting in further
appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. Since September 30, 2009, the exchange rate had remained stable at 6.8307 RMB to 1.00
U.S. dollar until September 30, 2010 when the People s Bank of China allowed a further appreciation of the RMB by 0.43 to 6.798
RMB to 1.00 U.S. dollar. The People s Bank of China allowed the RMB and U.S. dollar exchange rate to fluctuate within 1 on April
16, 2012 and 2 on March 17, 2014, respectively. On December 31, 2022, the RMB traded at 6.8972 RMB to 1.00 U.S. dollar. 

There
remains international pressure on the Chinese government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy and the exchange rate of RMB
is subject to changes in China s government policies which are, to a large extent, dependent on the economic and political development
both internationally and locally and the demand and supply of RMB in the domestic market. There can be no assurance that such exchange
rate will continue to remain stable in the future amongst the volatility of currencies, globalization and the unstable economies in recent
years. Since (i) our revenues and net income of our PRC operating entities are denominated in RMB, and (ii) the payment of dividends,
if any, will be in U.S. dollars, any decrease in the value of RMB against U.S. dollars would adversely affect the value of the shares
and dividends payable to shareholders, in U.S. dollars. 

Inflation 

To
date, inflation in China has not materially affected our results of operations. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China,
the year-over-year percent changes in the consumer price index for December 2022 and 2021 were increases of 2.0 , and 0.9 , respectively.
Although we have not been materially affected by inflation in the past, we may be affected if China experiences higher rates of inflation
in the future.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of
December 31, 2022, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). We concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange
Act were recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that
our disclosure controls are not effectively designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Management
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed under the supervision
of our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s Board of Directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its consolidated financial
statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. 

Material
Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2022 was not effective. 

A
material weakness, as defined in the standards established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ),
is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. 

The
ineffectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses: 

Inadequate
 segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; 

Lack
 of formal policies and procedures; 

Lack
 of risk assessment procedures on internal controls to detect financial reporting risks on a timely manner. 

Management
believes that the material weaknesses that were identified did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes
that these weaknesses, if not properly remediated, could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed,
have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent
limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to
reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

65 

Management s
Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness 

Management
has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness
are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions planned include: 

Identify
 gaps in our skills base and the expertise of our staff required to meet the financial reporting requirements of a public company;
 and 

Continue
 to develop policies and procedures on internal control over financial reporting and monitor the effectiveness of operations on existing
 controls and procedures. 

We
have engaged with a third-party financial consulting firm during the year to assist with the preparation of SEC reporting. We are committed
to maintaining a strong internal control environment, and believe that these remediation efforts will deliver improvements in our control
environment. Our management will continue to monitor and evaluate the relevance of our risk-based approach and the effectiveness of our
internal controls and procedures over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing
additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. 

This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding our internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the
SEC that exempt smaller reporting companies from this requirement. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fourth quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We

executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

To
our knowledge, during the last ten years, none of our directors and executive officers (including those of our subsidiaries) has: 

Had
 a bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at
 the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time. 

Been
 convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding, excluding traffic violations and other minor

Delinquent
Section 16(a) Reports

16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than
10 percent of our equity securities Reporting Persons to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the
SEC. Based solely on our review of copies of such reports and representations from the Reporting Persons, we believe that during the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Reporting Persons timely filed all such reports, except that Fei Bai, Xiaojin Tang, and Congjin Wang, directors of the
Company, failed to timely file Forms 3 as newly appointed directors of the Company. No securities of the Company are beneficially owned
by Mr. Bai, Mr. Tang, or Mr. Wang.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the shareholders and the board of directors of Wetouch Technology Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wetouch Technology Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows
for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the each of the two years in the period
ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that
was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are
not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or
disclosures to which it relates. 

Legal
Proceedings over Guarantee Obligations 

As
described in Note 13 to the financial statements, management disclosed legal proceedings over the Company s guarantee obligations
where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if management believes there is at least a
reasonable possibility that the Company has fulfilled the guarantee obligation or a loss may be incurred when the guarantee obligations
were not discharged. 

Our
principal considerations to determine that the legal proceedings over guarantee obligations is a critical audit matter as there was significant
judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when estimating the loss or range of loss for each
claim, which in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s
assessment of the liabilities and disclosures related to legal proceedings on guarantee obligations. 

Addressing
the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial
statements. These procedures included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with external legal counsel,
reviewing public accessible information regarding the Company s litigation cases, evaluating the reasonableness of management s
assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable, and evaluating the sufficiency
of the Company s disclosures related to legal proceedings over guarantee obligations.

We
 have served as the Company s auditor since 2019.
