 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION 
 
 Plan of Operation 
 
 The Company s cash balance is insufficient to satisfy the Company s cash requirements for the next 12 months. 
 
 Our notes to the financial statements disclose that the cash flow of the Company has been absorbed in operating activities, has incurred a minimal net income for the fiscal year and has a working capital deficiency. Due to the current restructuring, the Company operations are not likely to produce positive cash flow until at least the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our going concern uncertainty may affect our ability to raise additional capital, and may also affect our relationships with suppliers and customers. Investors should carefully examine our financial statements and read the notes to the financial statements.

Potential funding for operations is not expected until sometime in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 or beyond.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The discussions and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, including the discussion on liquidity and capital resources, are based upon the financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management re-evaluates its estimates and judgments, particularly those related to the determination of the impairment of its intangible assets. Actual results could differ from the estimates. We believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Revenue - 
 
 The Company had no sales activity during the current fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The Company records sales of its products based upon the terms of the contract; when title passes to its customers; and, when collectability is reasonably assured. 
 
 Income Taxes - 
 
 The amount of income taxes recorded by us requires the interpretation of complex rules and regulations of various taxing jurisdictions throughout the world. We have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for all significant temporary differences, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We routinely assess the potential realization of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We routinely assess potential tax contingencies and, if required, establish accruals for such contingencies. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of judgment by us and we review and adjust routinely our estimates based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although we believe our tax accruals are adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation and resolution of pending tax matters. 
 8 

Litigation - 
 
 An estimated loss from a loss contingency is recorded when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies such as legal matters requires the use of judgment as to the probability of the outcome and the amount. Many legal contingencies can take years to be resolved. An adverse outcome could have a material impact on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 
 
 Going Concern Qualification 
 
 Due to the lack of significant cash flow, the Company has a significant risk of not being able to continue as a going concern. Investors should carefully examine our financial statements. 
 
 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Risks Related to our Business and Operations 
 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, and all of the other information set forth in this Report before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. In addition to historical information, the information in this Report contains forward-looking statements about our future business and performance. Our actual operating results and financial performance may be different from what we expect as of the date of this Report. The risks described in this Report represent the risks that management has identified and determined to be material to our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also materially harm our business operations and financial condition. 
 We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not anticipate any cash dividends being paid to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. While our dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of the business, it is anticipated that any earnings will be retained to finance our future expansion. As we have no plans to issue cash dividends in the future, our common stock could be less desirable to other investors and as a result, the value of our common stock may decline, or fail to reach the valuations of other similarly situated companies who have paid dividends. 
 
 Dependence upon Suppliers and Other Third Parties: The Company relies on outsourced manufacturers for the production of all Sector 10 products. 
 
 Compliance with existing and new regulations of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses. 
 
 Compliance with changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other SEC regulations, requires large amounts of management attention and external resources. This may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. 
 
 Our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders have effective control of the company, preventing non-affiliate stockholders from significantly influencing our direction and future. 
 
 Our directors, officers, and 5 stockholders and their affiliates control in excess of 50 of our outstanding shares of common stock. There are anti-dilution provisions in agreements that are expected to provide this group to continue to control a majority of our outstanding common stock following any financing transactions projected for the foreseeable future. These directors, officers and affiliates effectively control all matters requiring approval by the stockholders, including any determination with respect to the acquisition or disposition of assets, future issuances of securities, declarations of dividends and the election of directors. This concentration of ownership may also delay, defer, or prevent a change in control and otherwise prevent stockholders other than our affiliates from influencing our direction and future. 
 9 
 
 There is a public market for our stock, but it is thin and subject to manipulation. 
 
 The volume of trading in our common stock is limited and can be dominated by a few individuals. The limited volume, if any, can make the price of our common stock subject to manipulation by one or more stockholders and will significantly limit the number of shares that one can purchase or sell in a short period of time. An investor may find it difficult to dispose of shares of our common stock or obtain a fair price for our common stock in the market. 
 
 The market price for our common stock is volatile and may change dramatically at any time. 
 
 The market price of our common stock, like that of the securities of other early-stage companies, is highly volatile. Our stock price may change dramatically as the result of announcements of our quarterly results, the rate of our expansion, or other factors or events that would be expected to affect our business or financial condition, results of operations and other factors specific to our business and future prospects. In addition, the market price for our common stock may be affected by various factors not directly related to our business, including the following: 
 intentional manipulation of our stock price by existing or future stockholders; 
 short selling of our common stock or related derivative securities; 
 a single acquisition or disposition, or several related acquisitions or dispositions, of a large number of our shares; 
 the interest, or lack of interest, of the market in our business sector, without regard to our financial condition or results of operations; 
 the adoption of governmental regulations and similar developments in the United States or abroad that may affect our ability to offer our products and services or affect our cost structure; 
 developments in the businesses of companies that purchase our products; and 
 economic and other external market factors, such as a general decline in market prices due to poor economic indicators or investor distrust. 
 Our business may be affected by increased compensation and benefits costs. 
 
 We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and it is unlikely that investors will derive any current income from ownership of our stock. This means that your potential for economic gain from ownership of our stock depends on appreciation of our stock price and will only be realized by a sale of the stock at a price higher than your purchase price. 
 
 Our common stock is a low-priced stock and subject to regulation that limits or restricts the potential market for our stock. 
 
 Shares of our common stock may be deemed to be low-priced or penny stock, resulting in increased risks to our investors and certain requirements being imposed on some brokers who execute transactions in our common stock. In general, a low-priced stock is an equity security that: 
 Is priced under five dollars; 
 Is not traded on a national stock exchange, the Nasdaq Global Market or the Nasdaq Capital Market; 
 Is issued by a company that has less than 5 million in net tangible assets (if it has been in business less than three years) or has less than 2 million in net tangible assets (if it has been in business for at least three years); and 
 Is issued by a company that has average revenues of less than 6 million for the past three years. 
 10 

We believe that our common stock is presently a penny stock. At any time the common stock qualifies as a penny stock, the following requirements, among others, will generally apply: 
 
 Certain broker-dealers who recommend penny stock to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to a transaction prior to sale. 
 Prior to executing any transaction involving a penny stock, certain broker-dealers must deliver to certain purchasers a disclosure schedule explaining the risks involved in owning penny stock, the broker-dealer s duties to the customer, a toll-free telephone number for inquiries about the broker-dealer s disciplinary history and the customer s rights and remedies in case of fraud or abuse in the sale. 
 In connection with the execution of any transaction involving a penny stock, certain broker-dealers must deliver to certain purchasers the following: 
 
 O bid and offer price quotes and volume information; 
 O the broker-dealer s compensation for the trade; 
 O the compensation received by certain salespersons for the trade;

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 Note 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS 
 
 The Company markets the MRU SRU product lines and the various solutions related to mobile assets 

Note 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
 
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements of Sector 10, Inc. Sector 10 or the Company ), have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-K and required by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. 
 
 Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 It is the Company s policy to invest cash with financial institutions judged to be highly secure. For purposes of the statement of cash flow, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. 
 
 Accounts Receivable 
 
 The Company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business. The Company reviews outstanding receivables, and provides for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the level of established loss reserves, the Company makes judgments regarding its customers ability to make required payments, economic events and other factors. As the financial condition of these parties change, circumstances develop or additional information becomes available, adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required. The Company has no sales and no receivables outstanding for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. 
 
 Inventory 
 
 Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis. There was no sales activity and no inventory on hand at the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The inventory has been recorded at no value as of March 31, 2022. Therefore, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, all inventory and the related reserve was 0. 

Property and Equipment and Depreciation 
 
 Property and equipment are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to income as incurred, whereas significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. The cost and the related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the statement of income. 
 
 The Company provides for depreciation of property and equipment principally by use of the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Depreciation begins in the month that depreciable assets are placed in service. The only assets currently placed in service are computers and furniture and equipment. Computers and depreciable equipment are estimated to have a useful life of 5 years. Depreciation is computed based on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life. All property and equipment is fully depreciated at the end of the fiscal year end. And is no longer reflected as an asset. 
 16 

Contingencies 
 
 We account for loss contingencies in accordance with ASC 450, Accounting for Contingencies. Accordingly, when management determines that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred, we accrue our best estimate of the loss if it can be reasonably estimated. Our legal costs related to litigation are expensed as incurred. 
 
 Income Tax 
 
 Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss, tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in the tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. 
 
 Earnings / Loss Per Share 
 
 In accordance with ASC 280, Earnings Per Share, we report basic loss per common share, which excludes the effect of potentially dilutive securities, and diluted loss per common share, which includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities unless their impact is anti-dilutive. 
 
 Share-Based Compensation 
 
 We may, from time to time, issue common stock, stock options or common stock warrants to acquire services or goods from non-employees. Common stock, stock options and common stock warrants issued to persons other than employees or directors are recorded on the basis of their fair value. 
 
 Long Lived Assets 
 
 The Company maintains a Long Lived Asset which is reviewed regularly for impairment. In its review for impairment, the Company prepares estimates of future cash flows to assist in the determination of the asset s recoverability. If there is an issue regarding recoverability, an independent valuation will be obtained to determine any required adjustment for impairment The estimates used in determining for recoverability are updated by the Company on a regular basis to provide guidance for management s quarterly and annual reporting. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 The Company had no sales activity during the current fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. The Company records sales of its products based upon the terms of the contract; when title passes to its customers; and, when collectability is reasonably assured. 
 
 Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Sector 10 does not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Note 3 INVENTORY 
 
 There were no sales in the year ended March 31, 2023. The inventory reflected on the books was 0 for the fiscal year ended March 31. 2023.

All interest is due under the terms of the various agreements. However future interest payments will not be made until cash flow issues are resolved, funding is available and a satisfactory revised payment arrangement is completed by all parties. 
 
 Note 5 EQUITY 
 
 During the Fiscal Year ended: March 31, 2023: 
 
 No equity transactions occurred in the period ended March 31, 2023 which resulted in new common shares being issued. The Company accrued 6,480,000 of common shares to be issued to existing shareholders for compensation earned for services rendered or per under anti-dilution agreements. No new shares were issued during the fiscal year. The accrual is established in accrued expenses and will be transferred to paid in capital when issued. 
 
 During the Fiscal Year ended: March 31, 2022: 
 
 No equity transactions occurred in the period ended March 31, 2022 
 
 Note 6 GOING CONCERN 
 
 The Company generated minimal revenues prior to the current fiscal year. No revenues were generated for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. This level of revenues is not sufficient for the Company to meet its future obligations. This factor raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 18 

Note 7 - INCOME TAX 
 
 Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. 
 
 Net deferred tax assets /liabilities consist of the following components as of March 31, 2023 and 2022: 

March 31, 2023

At March 31, 2023, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 1,785,396 that may be offset against future taxable income. No tax provision has been reported in the March 31, 2023 financial statements since the potential tax benefit is offset by a the NOL carryover of the same amount. 
 
 Net operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. No limitations applied to the current year as losses used were generated from pre-2018 tax years. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in future years. 
 
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB has issued ASC 740 for Accounting for Income Taxes that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. ASC 740 requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740, the Company performed a review of its material tax positions in accordance with recognition and measurement standards established by ASC 740. 
 
 The Company had no unrecognized tax benefit which would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. 
 
 The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations in the provision for income taxes. As of March 31, 2023 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. 
 19 

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in the states of Delaware, Washington and any other jurisdiction where required. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2019. 
 
 NOTE 8 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
 The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, payables, and notes payable. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents and payables approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. The carrying amount of the notes payable approximates fair value as the individual borrowings bear interest at rates that approximate market interest rates for similar debt instruments. 
 
 Note 9 OTHER INCOME 
 
 On October 21, 2020, Sector 10 settled an 11 year legal conflict. Based on this ruling, the Company recognized other income in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 due to the initial release of various debt and other liabilities associated with the settlement. In subsequent periods , an additional review of the settlement impact was conducted and additional debts and liabilities were identified that should be released due to the terms of the settlement. The total breakdown of the components of the Gain on the Extinguishment of Debt is as follows: .

Note 10 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
 
 The Company has evaluated subsequent events per the requirements of ASC Topic 855 and has determined that the following events should be disclosed. 
 
 1) The Company is reviewing various options to determine the future strategy of the Company operations. A situs change is being considered as one of the options subject to complying with any final adopted tax strategy. No determination has been finalized as of the filing date of this report. 
 
 2) The Company anticipates the need to issue additional equity in order to secure future funding. 
 
 3) The Current financial statements are unaudited. As a result, the XBRL filings cannot be made with the annual report Form 10-K.

The Company is currently in discussions with an audit firm to discuss this process.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
 
 The Company filed and/or will file all reports from the year ended March 31, 2011 and all subsequent periods until funds are available with unaudited financial statements which is acceptable for a company trading on the Pink Sheets. When funds are available, the Company will engage their audit firm to conduct an audit of all unaudited periods in an effort to move back to the Over the Counter Bulletin Board. The Company is currently in discussions with an audit firm to discuss this process. 
 
 There are no disagreements with the accountants on accounting and/or financial disclosures. 
 
 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of disclosure controls and procedures in Rule 13a-15(e). The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching the Company s desired disclosure control objectives. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 As of the end of the period being reported upon, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Company's Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 There have been no other significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect the internal controls subsequent to the date the Company completed its evaluation. 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, with the participation of our President, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. The disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of the President, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, concluded that, as of March 31, 2022 our internal control over financial reporting were effective. 
 21 

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting, that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only Management s report in this annual report.
