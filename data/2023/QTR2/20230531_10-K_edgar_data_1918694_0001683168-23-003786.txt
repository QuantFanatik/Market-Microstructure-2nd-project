 intend, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, 
 project, should, would and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but
the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this report may include,
for example, statements about: 

our ability to select an appropriate target business or businesses; 

our ability to complete our initial business combination; 

our expectations around the performance of the prospective target business or businesses; 

our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; 

our officers and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination, as a result of which they would then receive expense reimbursements; 

our potential ability to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination; 

our pool of prospective target businesses in the life sciences industry; 

the ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential acquisition opportunities;

the lack of a market for our securities; 

the use of proceeds not held in the trust account or available to us from interest income on the trust account balance; 

the trust account not being subject to claims of third parties; or 

our financial performance following our initial public offering. 

The forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on
our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that
future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties
(some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from
those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors
described under the heading Risk Factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any
of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements.
We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.

securities.

As of February 28, 2023, our total assets were
 60,770 comprised of cash and cash equivalents of 1,862, Intangible(net) of 28,183 and equipment(net) of 30,725 ; our total liabilities

PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING 

We expect that working capital requirements will
continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements
are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 

Existing working capital, further advances and
debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines
of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement
of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses
and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of software; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and
(iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we
expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of
equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate
funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors
or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

MATERIAL COMMITMENTS 

As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments. 

PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT 

W e do not intend to
purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not
have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
are material to investors.

GOING CONCERN 

The independent auditors' reports accompanying
our February 28, 2023 and 2022 financial statements contain an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, 
which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders, 

 Medies,
Inc. 

 London, United Kingdom 

OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

We have audited the
accompanying balance sheets of Medies Inc. (the Company as of February 28, 2023, and the related statements of
operations and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' deficit, and cash flows for each of the year then ended, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of February 28, 2023, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

BASIS FOR OPINION 

These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting . As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 NOTES TO THE AUDITED
 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY
 28, 2023 

NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS 

MEDIES. (the Company is a corporation
established under the corporation laws in the State of Wyoming on February 08, 2022. The company intends to commence operations concerning
a unique motion picture streaming service, within the domain of visual arts and metaverse. 

The Company has adopted February 28 fiscal year end. 

NOTE 2 GOING CONCERN 

The Company s financial statements as of
February 28, 2023 have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going
concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has
not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern.
The Company has accumulated losses from inception (February 08, 2022) to February 28, 2023 of 61,264. These factors among others raise
substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

In order to continue as a going concern, the Company
will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining
capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity
and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its
plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

NOTE 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation 

The financial statements of the Company have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

There were various accounting standards and interpretations
issued recently, none of which are expected to have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash flows. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows,
the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

F- 6 

Stock-Based Compensation 

During the year, the Company has issued 200,000
shares of stock-based payments to its Executive Vice Chairman, Mr. Simon Kidd. Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value
in accordance with ASC 718, when applicable. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. 

Use of Estimates and Assumptions 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Due to the limited level of operations, the Company
has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption that the Company is a going concern. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

ASC 825, Disclosures about Fair Value of
Financial Instruments , requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements 
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information
available to management as of February 28, 2023. 

The respective carrying values of certain on-balance-sheet
financial instruments approximate their fair values. These financial instruments include cash, accounts payable and related party loans
payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for these financial instruments since they are short term in nature and
their carrying amounts approximate fair value. 

Income Taxes 

Income taxes are provided in accordance with ASC
No. 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial
and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of
deferred tax assets and liabilities. 

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. 

F- 7 

Foreign currency translation 

Transactions denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency
using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations. 

Revenue Recognition 

We adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , and all related interpretations for recognition of our revenue from services. 

Revenue is recognized when the following criteria
are met: 

Identification of the contract, or contracts, with customer. 
 
 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract. 
 
 Determination of the transaction price. 
 
 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 
 
 Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligation. 

Recent Pronouncements 

The Company has evaluated all the recent accounting
pronouncements and determined that there are no other accounting pronouncements that will have a material effect on the Company s
financial statements. 

Fixed Assets 

Fixed assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost comprises purchase price, borrowing costs, if capitalization criteria
are met and directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for the intended use. Any subsidy/reimbursement/contribution
received for installation and acquisition of any fixed assets is shown as deduction in the year of receipt. Capital work- in progress
is stated at cost. 

Subsequent expenditure related to an item of fixed
assets is added to its book value only if it increases the future benefits from the existing asset beyond its previously assessed standard
of performance. All other expenses on existing fixed assets, including day-to-day repairs and maintenance expenditure and cost of replacing
parts, are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss for the period during which such expenses are incurred. 

Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of
fixed assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets derecognized. 

The Company utilizes straight-line depreciation
over the estimated useful life of the asset. 

Office Equipment 5 years 

F- 8 

Earnings per Share 

ASC No. 260, Earnings Per Share ,
specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly held common
stock. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC No. 260. 

Basic net loss per share amounts is computed by
dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are the same as basic
earnings per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company.

The Company has approximately
 61,264 of net operating losses NOL carried forward to offset taxable income, if any, in future years which expire in
fiscal 2041. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of
future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment,
management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax assets relating to NOLs for every period because
it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

NOTE 9 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

The Company has evaluated subsequent events to the date these financial
statements were issued and has determined that there are no items to disclose.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants
on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Item 9A(T). Controls and Procedures 

Management s Report on Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and
with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of February 28, 2023, using the criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of February 28, 2023, the Company determined that there were control
deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

1. 
We do not have an Audit Committee While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s view
that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s financial
statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee and does not include a member that is considered
to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities. 

2. 
We did not maintain appropriate segregation of duties and cash controls As of February 28, 2023, the Company has not maintained
sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting
functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company s bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were
mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in their bank accounts. 

3. 
We did not implement appropriate information technology controls As of February 28, 2023, the Company retains copies of all financial
data and material agreements; however, there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company s data or off-site
storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. 

Accordingly, the Company concluded that these
control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 

As a result of the material weaknesses described
above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 28,
2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 

7 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There has been no change in our internal control
over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of February 28, 2023, that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

This annual report does not include an attestation
report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. The management s
report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC
that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.
