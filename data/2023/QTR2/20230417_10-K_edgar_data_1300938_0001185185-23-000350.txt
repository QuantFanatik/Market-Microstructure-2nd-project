ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

OVERALL STRATEGIC DIRECTION 

The Company is in the Photo Voltaic (PV) solar systems industry, the LED and energy efficient lighting business, is an air conditioning system contractor (HVAC) and is an electrical product and services supplier. The Company plans to build out a network of operations, through internal growth and acquisitions, in major cities in the USA to establish a national base of PV suppliers, lighting suppliers, HVAC and electrical service operations centers. This combination of services, solar PV, solar AC Systems, lighting and electric, provides the Company with a solid base in the electrical services business and a solid base in the growth markets of solar PV industry and the LED lighting industry.

OVERVIEW 

As of December 31, 2022, we operated in Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona. We believe that the solar and energy efficiency business functions better if the employees are local individuals working and selling in their own community. Our customers have indicated a preference for dealing with local firms and we will continue our focus on company-owned integrated product and services offices. Once a local firm is established, growth tends to come from experience, quality and name recognition. We remain committed to high quality operations. 

Our unaudited statements for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 are presented below with major category details of revenue and expense including the components of operating expenses. 

DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS 

ABCO sells and installs Solar Photovoltaic electric systems that allow the customer to produce their own power on their residence or business property. These products are installed by our crews and are purchased from both the USA and offshore manufacturers. We have available and utilize many suppliers of US manufactured solar products from such companies as Peimar, Mia Soleil, Canadian Solar, Boviet, Westinghouse Solar and various Korean, German, Italian and Chinese suppliers. In addition, we purchase from several local and regional distributors whose products are readily available and selected for markets and prices. ABCO offers solar leasing and long-term financing programs from Service Finance Corporation, Green Sky, AEFC and others that are offered to ABCO customers and other marketing and installation organizations. 

ABCO also sells and installs energy efficient lighting products, solar powered streetlights, and lighting accessories. ABCO contracts directly with manufacturers to purchase its lighting products which are sold to residential and commercial customers. 

ABCO has Arizona statewide approval as a registered electrical services and solar products installer and as an air conditioning and refrigeration installer. Our license is ROC 258378 electrical and ROC 323162 Air Conditioning (HVAC0 and we are fully licensed to offer commercial and residential electrical services, HVAC and solar. 

The ABCO subsidiary, Alternative Energy Finance Corporation, (AEFC) a Wyoming Company provides funding for leases of photovoltaic systems. AEFC financed its owned leases from its own cash and now arranges financing with funds provided by other lessors. 

ABCO Solar offers solar systems Operations and Maintenance Services to residential and commercial customers that have solar systems built by ABCO or other solar installers. Many installers have gone out of business and ABCO s service enables these customers system to continue to operate. ABCO s service enables customers to maintain their warranties, remove and replace their systems for roof maintenance, clean solar panels and to maintain peak efficiency. ABCO now operates and maintains systems in many cities in Arizona and intends to continue to expand this operation and maintenance segment of its business. 

COMPETITION 

The solar power market itself is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving. Price and available financing are the principal methods of competition in the industry. Based upon these two criteria, our position in the industry is relatively small. There is no competitive data available to us in our competitive position within the industry. Our competitors have established market positions more prominent than ours, and if we fail to attract and retain customers and establish a successful distribution network, we may be unable to achieve sales and market share. There are several major multi-national corporations that produce solar power products, including Suntech, Sunpower, First Solar, Kyocera, Sharp, GE, Mitsubishi, Solar World AG and Sanyo. Also, established integrators are growing and consolidating, including GoSolar, Sunwize and Sunenergy and we expect that future competition will include new entrants to the solar power market. Further, many of our competitors are developing and are currently producing products based on new solar power technologies that may have costs similar to, or lower than, our projected costs. 

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES 

The Company believes that its key competitive advantages are: 

1. 

The ability to make decisions and use management s many years of business experience to make the right decisions. 

2. 

Experience with National expansion programs by management. 

3. 

Experience with management of employee operated facilities from a central management office. 

4. 

Experience with multi-media promotional program for name recognition and product awareness. 

5. 

Alternative energy is a fast growing and popular industry that relates well to customers and current or future shareholders that recognize the market, products and business focus.

Table of Contents 

ADVANTAGES OF COMPETITORS OVER US 

The Company believes the following are advantages of Competitors over us. 

1. 

Larger competitors have more capital. 

2. 

Larger companies have more experience in the market. 

3. 

Larger companies will get the larger contracts because of the level of experience. 

4. 

We have the same products but must pay more because of the volume. This will be a price consideration in bidding competition 

5. 

We are a small company that may not be able to compete because we do not have experience or working capital adequate to compete with other companies. 

CURRENT BUSINESS FOCUS 

We have developed very good promotional material and advertising products. We have developed key messages and promotional pieces that are relevant to our business and inexpensive to produce. We have built an informative and interactive web site that will allow people to assess their requirements and partially build and price a system, much like the automobile dealers utilize. Additional sales promotion will increase when we have secured outside financing or increased sales through direct sales efforts. Readers should review our websites at www.abcosolar.com and www.abcoac.com. 

We have established a direct sales force to sell to Government agencies including State, Local and Federal resources and a separate division to call on the many American Indian governments in the US. This allows us to quote with our specifications, products and services on Requests for Proposals (RFP s) that are issued by the Government Services Agency (GSA), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and other agencies. We have found that many projects are not known to the general public and most contractors because governmental agencies do not widely advertise their projects. By departmentalizing this opportunity, we get more information on projects than is available in the normal course of business. 

ABCO does not manufacture its solar voltaic (PV) products. We will continue to be a sales and installation contractor with plans to enter the markets of major US and international cities. We will sell and use commercial off the shelf components. Initially this will include the solar panels and LED lighting products purchased to our specification. A strong alliance with a well-respected distributor will be the most conservative decision for the company at this time. 

ABCO will contract directly with manufacturers for its Solar Street Light and other lighting products and will sell, install and maintain these products. 

Our business and the industry are reliant upon several state and federal programs to assist our customers in the acquisition of our products and services. Such programs are the utility rebates paid directly to customers for wattage installations and the state and federal tax credit programs that allow a percentage of the actual cost of installations to be refunded in the form of tax credits. Many states have mandated the utilities to collect funds from their customers for the payment of rebates. All of these programs are listed on the website www.dsireusa.org. 

Most of these programs are slated for expiration at differing times in the future. The federal tax credit (ITC) of 30 of installation cost expired at the end of 2019 but was slated to continue at reduced rates through 2024. The 2020 and 2021 rate was 26 . During 2022, Congress passed an extension of the ITC, raising it to 30 for solar installations completed between 2022-2032. The customers benefit from the federal and state tax credits which pass through to the owners of the solar systems. Investors often require the ownership to remain in their hands so that the tax credits can be passed through to them. This results in a lesser amount to finance and a benefit to the lessee because it lowers the lease payments. We emphasize that we cannot predict any future or the outcome of unknowns. State rebate mandates and state tax credits are variable by state. All of these programs provide incentives for our customers that result in reduced costs. The price of solar products has also been reduced drastically in the past few years which is helping to balance the reduction of the subsidies. 

The State of Arizona subsidized incentives are not material to our programs at this time. Since the State of Arizona offers 1,000 tax credit per residential installation and no utility rebates for residential or commercial installations of solar systems, this amount of credit is not likely to negatively impact our business because it will not materially affect the price of the installation. This amount currently represents less than 5 of the price of an average residential installation.

CUSTOMER BASE 

Referrals are important in any market and time in business makes the customer base grow. No customer represented a significant percentage of the Company s total revenue in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, or 2021. The company believes that the knowledge, relationships, reputation and successful track record of its management will help it to build and maintain its customer base. 

EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT 

The Company believes that it has experienced management. ABCO s president, David Shorey, has 15 years of experience in the sales and installation of solar products and more than 40 years of business experience. Mr. Shorey has the ability and experience to attract and hire experienced and talented individuals to help manage the company. 

ABCO has several experienced and long-term employees on staff with a number of years of experience in the provision of electrical services including lighting, HVAC and solar installations. The Company believes that the knowledge, relationships, reputation and successful track record of its management will help it to build and maintain its customer base. 

FINANCIAL RESOURCES 

ABCO s development activities since inception have been financially sustained through the sale of equity and capital contribution from shareholders. We will continue to source capital from the equity and debt markets in order to fund our plans for expansion if we are unable to produce adequate capital from operations. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to obtain adequate capital from these sources, or at all. 

EMPLOYEES 

The Company presently has [twelve [12]] full-time employees with [four [4]] in management, and [two [2]] in sales and the balance are in various labor crew positions. The Company anticipates that it will need to hire additional employees as the business grows. In addition, the Company may expand the size of our Board of Directors in the future. Mr. Shorey devotes full time (40 plus hours) to the affairs of the Company. No employees are represented by a union and there have not been any work stoppages. 

IMPLICATIONS OF BEING AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY 

We are an emerging growth company , as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 JOBS Act ). For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 40(t) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act SOX and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports. 

Under the JOBS Act, we will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: 

the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of 1 Billion dollars; 

the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of completion of our first offering; 

the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt; and 

The date on which we are deemed to be large, accelerated filer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). We will qualify as a large, accelerated filer as of the first day of the first fiscal year after we have (i) more than 700 million in accelerated common equity held by our non-affiliated shareholders and (ii) been public for at least 12 months. The value of our outstanding common equity will be measured each year on the last day of our second fiscal quarter.

Table of Contents 

The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can utilize the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), for complying with new or revisited accounting standards. However, we are choosing to opt out of such extended transition period, and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that are not emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. 

We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to either public company that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of SOX. As an emerging growth company we are required to report fewer years of selected historical financial data than that reported by other public companies. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of any June 30 (the end of our second fiscal quarter) in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 (our fiscal year end). We cannot predict if investors will find our shares less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our shares less attractive as a result, there may be less active trading market for our shares and the price of our shares may be more volatile. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

See below. Otherwise, not required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies. 

COVID-19 DISCLOSURE 

COVID-19 is currently impacting countries, communities, businesses, and markets, as well as global financial condition and results of operations for 2022 and 2021. We believe that it could have a bearing on our ability to follow through with our business plan for the next 12 months, including our ability to obtain necessary financing. 

While acknowledging that the impact of COVID-19 and the new Omicron variant is evolving rapidly and involves uncertainties, the SEC encourages companies to provide disclosures that allow investors to evaluate the current and expected impact of COVID-19 and the new Omicron variant through the eyes of management. The SEC also encourages companies to proactively update disclosures as facts and circumstances change. To that end, we have endeavored to address, where applicable, how COVID-19 and the new Omicron variant have impacted on our financial conditions in MD A. We do not know how COVID-19 and the new Omicron variant will impact future operating results and our long-term financial condition. We have indicated what our overall liquidity position is now, but we cannot predict the long-term outlook. COVID-19 has had a negative effect on fund raising and both may have a negative effect on our ability to service our debt on a timely basis. We do not currently anticipate any material impairment including increases in allowances for bad debt, restructuring charges or other changes which could have a material impact on our financial statements on a timely basis. We do not expect to experience any significant challenges to implementing our business continuity plans nor do we expect COVID-19 to materially affect the demand for our services nor do we see any material change in the relationship between cost and services. The supply chain disruption and the new Omicron variant have not had any significant effect on our operations to date. 

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. 

None. 

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. 

The Company purchased land and buildings for its operations on December 31, 2019, and moved into the property in October 2020. The property consists of 4800 square foot of office and 1200 square foot of warehouse space and approximately one-half acre of land. The entire cost of the property was 325,000 plus closing costs. The property was financed by a 25,000 loan from Green Capital (GCSG) and a mortgage from the seller for the balance. The purchase price was allocated between Building 125,000 and Land 200,000. The previously occupied space was abandoned at the end of its lease and the Company wrote off the cost of abandoned leasehold improvements in 2020. The Company considers these facilities adequate for current operations level and for substantial growth in the future. Additional space is available in the current locations if needed. ABCO added a full solar electric array to our property during the year ended December 31, 2022 and currently enjoys substantially reduced electric bills.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, or operating results.

Our shares are listed on the OTC PINK Market under the symbol ABCE. On December 31, 2022, there were approximately 210 record holders of Company shares, not including all unknown names in the transfer system CEDE . 

The OTC Bulletin Board is maintained by the National Association of Securities Dealers (the NASD, now known as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)). The securities traded on the Bulletin Board are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, these securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. Over-the-counter stocks are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange. 

Even if our shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board , a purchaser of our shares may not be able to resell the shares. Broker- dealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in our shares because they will be considered penny stocks and will be subject to the penny stock rules. Upon becoming a reporting company, Rules 15g-1 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on FINRA brokers-dealers who make a market in a penny stock. A penny stock generally includes any non-NASDAQ equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share. Under the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or accredited investor (generally, an individual with net worth in excess of 1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding 200,000, or 300,000 together with his or her spouse) must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to sale, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. In addition, the penny stock regulations require the broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a broker-dealer is required to send monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the penny stock held in a customer s account and information with respect to the limited market in penny stocks. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon broker-dealers may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our shares, which could severely limit the market liquidity of the shares and impede the sale of our shares in the secondary market, assuming one develops. 

We are currently trading on the gray Market after OTC Markets removed ABCO from the OTC Pink Market for failure to file audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and for 2022 Audited Financial Statements ). Upon filing of the Audited Financial Statements for the 3 years ended 12/31/22, we be reinstated on the OTC Pink Market. 

In addition to the penny stock rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. 

MARKET INFORMATION HOLDERS 

As of April 1, 2023, we had approximately 210 shareholders of record of our common stock. The number of record holders was determined from the records of our transfer agent. Shareholders not included on the transfer agents listing include shareholders from other sources including beneficial owners of common stock whose shares are held in the names of various security brokers, dealers, and registered clearing agencies for which we have no record. The transfer agent of our common stock is VStock Transfer LLC, 18 Lafayette Place, Woodmere, New York, 17598. 

DIVIDENDS 

We have never paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain future earnings to fund ongoing operations and future capital requirements of our business. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and such other factors as the Board deems relevant.

OVERVIEW 

As of December 31, 2022, we operated in Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona. The Company s plan is to expand to more locations in North America in the next year. We believe that the solar and energy efficiency business functions better if the employees are local individuals working and selling in their own community. Our customers have indicated a preference for dealing with local firms and we will continue our focus on company-owned integrated product and services offices. Once a local firm is established, growth tends to come from experience, quality and name recognition. This will result in larger contracting jobs, statewide expansion and growth in revenue. We remain committed to high quality operations. 

Our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 are presented below with major category details of revenue and expense including the components of operating expenses. The footnotes to the financial statements disclose the related party transactions of Officer, Directors and other related parties. 

FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022, COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021 

Sales increased to 1,980,504 in 2022, an increase of 608,094 or 45 over 2021 sales of 1,372,410. The Covid 19 Pandemic, Lack of funds and available staff has reduced our ability to maintain our sales momentum. Our experience has shown us that there is going to be such pressure on our market, and we are changing to prevent decreases in sales in the future. We have added new products and new sales personnel and intend to find merger and acquisition funding and acquisition or merger candidates during the current year. There is no assurance that ABCO will be able to accomplish these goals in the coming year. 

Cost of sales increased by 328,831, or 35 to 1,277,722 in 2022 from 948,891 in 2021 due primarily to the increase in sales. The Company also changed its focus from residential installations to a commercial focus in order to meet changes in the market. Gross margin as a percentage of total sales was at 36 in 2022 from 31 in 2021, primarily due to higher margins associated with commercial jobs and better management of costs on the larger commercial jobs in 2022. We hope to bid these contracts more favorably in the future to prevent negative cost of sales numbers. We hope that more efficient production and a sales mix shift to the higher profit commercial market emphasis will improve these numbers. 

General and administrative expenses increased by 246,785 to 1,093,425 in 2022 from 846,640 in 2021 due primarily to increases in stock-based compensation to management which accounted for more than the total increase for the period. We also decreased our administration staff from 2021 in order to control operating expenses and to closely administer public company expenses. 

Net loss from operations decreased by 626,280 to (43,626) for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to a loss from operations of (669,906) for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase is attributable to expenses from stock-based compensation and financing. We had similar margins in 2022 as in 2021 due to the emphasis on commercial projects. 

Total Net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, was (173,259) and (668,375) for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease is attributable to expenses from stock-based compensation, financing and professional fee charges in 2022 that did not occur in 2021. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Our primary liquidity and capital requirements have been for carrying cost of accounts receivable and inventory during and after completion of contracts. This process can easily exceed 90 days and requires the contractor to pay all or most of the cost of the project without assistance from suppliers. Our working capital on December 31, 2022, was (1,597,509) and it was (1,390,788) on December 31, 2021. This decrease of 206,721 was primarily funded by our officer s loans and private equity offerings. 

ABCO Energy has decreased its loan obligations or long-term debt in 2022 and 2021. Our long-term debt net of current portion totaled 454,041 on December 31, 2022, and 495,525 on December 31, 2021, due mainly to the payments on SBA loans and equipment purchase loans obtained by the Company. 

On December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company owed its President and Director 634,733 and 533,244 respectively on demand notes. This is an increase of 101,489 which represents an additional loan from the President of ABCO. 

Bank financing has not been available to the Company.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS 

During the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 our net cash used in operating activities was 5,487 and (612,949) respectively. Net cash used by operating activities in the period ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 consisted primarily of net loss from operations adjusted for non-cash expenses, stock-based compensation expense and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 was (25,788) and 667 respectively. This is primarily due to the purchase of autos for operations and investment in our building improvements, including the addition of a solar array. Net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 was 8,988 and 589,428 respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2022 and 2021 resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock and the conversion of convertible debt into common stock and officer s loans. 

Since our inception on August 8, 2008, through December 31, 2022, we have incurred net losses of (7,919,619), including the effects of derivatives on convertible debt totaling 2,305,951 and stock-based compensation of 562,699 over the last few years. Our cash and cash equivalent balances were 20,101 and 31,414 as of December 31, 2022, and 2021 respectively. On December 31, 2022, we had total liabilities of 2,783,415 as opposed to 2,249,620 on December 31, 2021, an increase of 533,795. Most of the increase occurred because of the SBA long term loan, officer s loans, the auto purchases, excess billings on contracts in process and derivative liabilities. 

We plan to satisfy our future cash requirements, primarily the working capital required for the marketing of our products and services, by additional financing and more operations income. This will likely be in the form of future debt or equity financing. Based on our current operating plan, we have sufficient working capital to sustain operations in the short term if we do not expand our business. We will not, however, be able to reach our goals and projections for multistate expansion without a cash infusion. We expect that our revenue will increase at a steady pace and that this volume of business will result in profitable operations in the future.

on December 31, 2022 and on December 31, 2021. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares and the dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. All shares were considered anti-dilutive on December 31, 2022, and 2021. Potentially dilutive share issues are: 1) all unissued common shares sold, 2) all convertible debentures have a possibility of a large number of shares being issued and would result in a larger number of shares issued if the price remains low, 3) the preferred stock of the company held by insiders is convertible into common shares and the preferred stock is voted on a 20 to 1 basis, 4) all options issued. All of the above are potentially dilutive items.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. 

None. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(a) 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

As of the end of the reporting period, December 31, 2022, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Company s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer/Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), which disclosure controls and procedures are designed to insure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman/CEO and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company required to be included in the Company s period SEC filings. The Company is attempting to expand such controls and procedures, however, due to a limited number of resources the complete segregation of duties is not currently in place. 

(b) 

Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and the principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. 

Based on our evaluation under the Internal Control-Integrated Framework, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2019. Management believes that this conclusion results in a large part from [i] maintaining some segregation of duties within the Company due to its reliance on individuals to fill multiple roles and responsibilities and [ii] the Company having limited personnel to prepare its financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company continued its reliance on the Internal Control Integrated Framework in the same manner as in prior periods due to the same limitations of personnel. 

(c) 

Changes in Internal Control. 

Subsequent to the date of such evaluations as described in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above, there were no changes in our internal controls or other factors that could significantly affect these controls, including any corrective action with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 

(d) 

Limitations. 

Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors or all instances of fraud. However, we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving this objective. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitation of a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Shares of common stock subject to options or warrants currently exercisable or convertible, or exercisable or convertible within 60 days of March 31, 2019 (none are eligible) are deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of the person holding such option or warrant but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of any other person. 

(3) 

Based upon 260,515,166 shares outstanding on December 31, 2022. 

(4) 

These shares are convertible into 128,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of .001 per share. 

(5) 

Based upon 12,800,000 shares of Preferred Stock, outstanding as December 31, 2022. 

(6) 

These shares are held of record by a corporate entity owned by David Shorey. 

The aggregate of 0 stock awards were outstanding under the Equity Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2022. 

On September 15, 2017, and on August 30, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of an aggregate of 30,000,000 shares of Class B Convertible Preferred Stock [ Series B ] to Mr. O Dowd and to Wayne Marx of the Company and to two Consultant Companies owned by David Shorey, President, CEO, CFO and Director. Of the Series B, 12,000,000 shares were issued to Charles O Dowd and 2,000,000 to Wayne Marx, the Directors. Each Consultant received 8,000,000 shares. See the Company s Schedule 14C filed with the Commission on September 28, 2018. Upon his resignation Mr. O Dowd s preferred shares were cancelled and issued to the two consultants. These preferred shares have no market pricing and management assigned the value of 15,000 to the stock issue based on the par value of the preferred stock of 0.001. Mr. Marx s preferred stock was re-issued to a consultant upon his resignation in November 2021. The 30,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock had 200 votes for each share of record. The holders of the Preferred are also entitled to be issued an additional 300,000,000 common shares upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. Series B have anti-dilution provisions. Accordingly, as a result of owning these shares of Common and Preferred Stock, the Control Shareholders will have voting control over the Company. During 2021, David Shorey converted 17,200,000 shares of preferred stock into 172,000,000 shares of common stock and distributed 32,000,000 shares to a consultant of the company. 

The shareholders on January 11, 2021, authorized an increase in authorized common shares to 2,000,000,000 from 29,411,765 shares. Our board of directors believes that it is desirable to have additional authorized shares of common stock available for possible future financing, acquisition transactions, joint ventures and other general corporate purposes. Our board of directors believes that having such additional authorized shares of common stock available for issuance in the future will give us greater flexibility and may allow such shares to be issued without the expense and delay of a special shareholders meeting unless such approval is expressly required by applicable law. Although such issuance of additional shares with respect to future financing and acquisitions would dilute existing shareholders, management believes that such transactions would increase the overall value of the Company to its shareholders.
