Cautionary
Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

We
may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements with respect to our future goals, including statements contained
in this Form 10-K, in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and in our reports to stockholders. 

Certain
information which does not relate to historical financial information may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements include information concerning the launch
of our asset management business and related investment vehicles, strategic initiatives and potential acquisitions, the results of operations
of our existing business lines, the impact of legal or regulatory matters on our business, as well as other actions, strategies and expectations,
and are identifiable by use of the words believes, expects, intends, anticipates, 
 plans, seeks, estimates, projects, may, will, could, 
 might, or continues or similar expressions. Such statements are subject to a wide range of risks and uncertainties
that could cause our actual results in the future to differ materially from our historical results and those presently anticipated or
projected. We wish to caution investors not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements
speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events
or circumstances arising after such date. Risk factors include various factors set forth from time to time in our filings with the SEC
including the following: the negative impacts of our delisting from the OTCQB, including reduced liquidity and market price of our common
stock and the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock; significant costs relating to pending and future litigation;
our ability to attract and retain talented personnel; the structure or success of our participation in any joint investments; risks associated
with any future acquisition or business opportunities; our need to consume resources in researching acquisitions, business opportunities
or financings and capital market transactions; our ability to integrate additional businesses or technologies; the market price volatility
of our common stock; our need to incur asset impairment charges for intangible assets and goodwill; our reliance on aging information
systems and our ability to protect those systems against security breaches; changes in tax guidance and related interpretations and inspections
by tax authorities; our ability to raise capital from third party investors for our asset management business; our ability to comply
with extensive regulations relating to the launch and operation of our asset management business; our ability to compete in the intensely
competitive asset management business; the performance of any investment funds we sponsor or accounts we manage; difficult market and
economic conditions, including changes in interest rates and volatile equity and credit markets; our ability to achieve steady earnings
growth on a quarterly basis in our asset management business; the significant demands placed on our resources and employees, and associated
increases in expenses, risks and regulatory oversight, resulting from the potential growth of our asset management business; our ability
to establish a favorable reputation for our asset management business; the lack of operating history of our asset manager subsidiary
and any funds that we may sponsor; foreign currency fluctuations and negative or uncertain global or regional economic conditions as
well as various factors set forth from time to time in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and from time to time in our filings with the SEC.

PART
I 

Item
1. Business. 

General

GlassBridge
Enterprises, Inc. owns and operates an asset management business through various subsidiaries. 

As
used in this document, the terms GlassBridge , the Company , we , us , and our 
mean GlassBridge Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. 

Asset
Management Business 

The
Company operates its private asset management business through a number of subsidiaries. We expect our
asset management business to earn revenues primarily by providing investment advisory services to third party investors through managed
funds, as well as separate managed accounts. 

Our
employees each support one or more of the subsidiaries, which provide to our clients what we consider unique and cutting-edge investment
strategies. Since the end of 2019, we have added or augmented a number of strategies and continue to seek and create additional ones.
We may also look to acquire other asset managers to complement or supplement our business. 

We
have established a full internal support infrastructure for our asset management business that can support additional strategies and
assets growth. 

Our
asset management business s success will depend in large part on our ability to create attractive investment products and raise
capital from third party investors. If we are unable to raise capital from third party investors, we would be unable to collect management
fees or deploy capital into investments and potentially collect performance fees, which would adversely affect our ability to generate
revenue and cash flow from this business. 

The
investment advisory industry is intensely competitive. We compete with many domestic and global competitors that may provide investment
products with similar features and objectives to those we offer. These institutions range from small boutique firms to large financial
institutions. 

Poor
performance of any investment funds we sponsor or accounts we manage would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue, income and
cash flow, and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future investment funds and accounts. 

Difficult
market and economic conditions, including, without limitation, changes in interest rates and volatile equity and credit markets, can
adversely affect our asset management business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments made by
any investment funds we sponsor or accounts we manage and reducing our ability to raise or deploy capital, each of which could adversely
affect our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition. 

Any
revenue, earnings, net income and cash flow attributable to our asset management business is likely to be highly variable, which may
make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause the price of shares of our common stock
to decline and be volatile. 

Company
History 

GlassBridge
was incorporated as Imation Corp. in Delaware in 1996, from the spin-off of substantially all of 3M Company s data storage and
imaging systems businesses. We changed our name to GlassBridge Enterprises, Inc. in 2017. 

GlassBridge
has, during recent periods, undergone significant changes. Until 2015, we primarily provided data storage and security solutions through
our two legacy business segments. On August 16, 2018, the Company sold its Nexsan business. During 2019, the Company sold its international
subsidiaries and acquired a controlling interest in SportBLX. On December 30, 2021, the Company sold its interest in SportBLX. 

3 

In
July 2020, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries completed a series of transactions that resulted, among other things, in the Company s
reacquiring shares of Adara Enterprises, Corp. Adara or AEC sold in October 2019; disposing of obligations
incurred in connection with the sale; and entering into a Loan and Security Agreement (the ESW Loan Agreement ). 

In
January 2021, Adara received notice from ESW Holdings, Inc. ESW that Adara had defaulted on its obligation to pay at
maturity, i.e., on January 20, 2021, 11,000,000 in principal and all other amounts due to ESW under the ESW Loan Agreement.
Pursuant to the ESW Loan Agreement, AEC gave to ESW a security interest in all of AEC s assets, and GlassBridge pledged to ESW
all of GlassBridge s AEC stock and 30 of GlassBridge s SportBLX stock. The Loan Agreement provided that, upon
AEC s default, AEC may elect to cooperate with ESW to effect a prearranged reorganization of AEC in bankruptcy, pursuant to
which ESW would acquire all equity in AEC, as reorganized, and indirectly certain of AEC s assets, most notably, property and
equipment consisting of quantitative trading software, as well as deferred tax assets resulting from AEC s net operating
losses. In the loan agreement, ESW agreed to provide 8.5 million to the bankruptcy estate to cover costs of administering the AEC
bankruptcy case and to satisfy the claims of valid creditors, with any residual funds to be paid to GlassBridge. The 8.5 million
was to be paid upon the effectiveness of AEC s Chapter 11 plan (less any amounts advanced to AEC in the form of a DIP loan)
and maintained awaiting outside creditor claims. 

AEC s
prepackaged Chapter 11 plan of reorganization was confirmed at a hearing on June 9, 2021 and became effective on June 15, 2021 (the Effective
Date ). Upon the occurrence of the Effective Date, ESW deposited 8.5 million, less 325,000 that ESW had previously funded in
the form of a post-petition debtor-in-possession loan, into a distribution trust established pursuant to AEC s Chapter 11 plan
to fund the costs of administration associated with AEC s bankruptcy case and to satisfy valid creditor claims. Also on the Effective
Date, by order of the Bankruptcy Court, GlassBridge shares of AEC were canceled, and shares in reorganized AEC were issued to ESW and
an affiliate. Finally, on the Effective Date, GlassBridge received a release of its guaranty obligations to ESW. 

The
Company received distributions from the bankruptcy estate totaling 6,594,703 in 2021 and received additional distributions of 17,909
during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there are no funds remaining in the bankruptcy estate. 

Adara
has historically been one of the subsidiaries through which the Company has operated its asset management business. The Company, however,
remains committed to its asset management business and holds various investments and assets, including Arrive LLC Arrive ),
in other subsidiaries. 

At
December 31, 2022, the Company employed 5 people.

Introduction

GlassBridge
has, during recent periods, undergone significant changes. Until 2015, we primarily provided data storage and security solutions through
our two legacy business segments. On August 16, 2018, the Company sold its Nexsan business. During 2019, the Company sold its international
subsidiaries and acquired a controlling interest in SportBLX. On December 30, 2021, the Company sold its interest in SportBLX. 

As
a result of these transactions, the Company now operates a single segment, an asset management business. 

In
January 2021, Adara received notice from ESW that Adara had defaulted on its obligation to pay at maturity, i.e., on January 20, 2021,
 11,000,000 in principal and all other amounts due to ESW under the ESW Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the ESW Loan Agreement, AEC gave
to ESW a security interest in all of AEC s assets, and GlassBridge pledged to ESW all of GlassBridge s AEC stock and 30 
of GlassBridge s SportBLX stock. The Loan Agreement provided that, upon AEC s default, AEC may elect to cooperate with ESW
to effect a prearranged reorganization of AEC in bankruptcy, pursuant to which ESW acquires from GlassBridge all equity in AEC and certain
of its assets, most notably property and equipment consisting of quantitative trading software, as well as deferred tax assets resulting
from net operating losses, for consideration of 8,500,000, which amount would be used to satisfy the claims of all valid creditors and
certain administrative expenses associated with the bankruptcy case, with all residual funds to be paid to GlassBridge. On April 22,
2021, AEC filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court for the
District of Delaware. AEC s prepackaged chapter 11 plan of reorganization was confirmed at a hearing on June 9, 2021 and became
effective on June 15, 2021. On the effective date, ESW paid 8.5 million, less 325,000 that ESW had previously funded in the form of
a postpetition debtor-in-possession loan to fund the costs of administration associated with AEC s bankruptcy case. Also on the
effective date, all shares in reorganized AEC were issued to ESW and an affiliate. In addition, GlassBridge received a release of its
guaranty obligations to ESW. 

The
Company received distributions from the bankruptcy estate totaling 6,594,703 in 2021 and received additional distributions of 17,909
during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there are no funds remaining in the bankruptcy estate. 

Adara
has historically been one of the subsidiaries through which the Company has operated its asset management business. The Company, however,
remains committed to its asset management business and holds various investments and assets, including Arrive, in other subsidiaries.

The

the tax provision generally represents discrete tax events that may occur from time to time. 

As
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had valuation allowances of 148.1 million and 157.2 million, respectively, to account for deferred
tax assets we have concluded are not considered to be more-likely-than-not to be realized in the future due to our cumulative losses
in recent years. The deferred tax assets subject to valuation allowance include certain operating loss carryforwards, deferred tax deductions,
capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.

Segment
Results 

With
the sale of the Sport Technology Platform business on December 30, 2021, the asset management business is our only reportable segment
as of December 31, 2022. Results from the Sports Technology Platform were reported within discontinued operations. 

We
evaluate segment performance based on revenue and operating loss. The operating loss reported in our segments excludes corporate and
other unallocated amounts. Although such amounts are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated
results. Corporate and unallocated amounts include costs which are not allocated to the business segments in management s evaluation
of segment performance such as litigation settlement expense, corporate expense and other expenses.

Financial
Position 

Our
cash and cash equivalents balance, as of December 31, 2022, was 1.2 million, compared to cash of 4.1 million, as of December 31, 2021.
See the Analysis of Cash Flows section below for more information. 

Our
accounts payable balance, as of December 31, 2022, was 1.2 million, an increase of 0.1 million from 1.1 million, as of December 31,
2021. 

Our
other current liabilities balance, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, was 0.4 million. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
primary sources of liquidity include our cash and cash equivalents. Our primary operating liquidity needs relate to our working capital
and funding our operations. 

We
had 1.2 million cash on hand as of December 31, 2022. 

Our
liquidity needs for the next 12 months include the following: corporate expenses of approximately 2.8 million and any cash shortfall
associated with our businesses. 

We
expect that our cash, in addition to asset monetization, will provide liquidity sufficient to meet our needs for our operations and our
obligations. We also plan to raise additional capital if necessary, although no assurance can be made that we will be able to secure
such financing, if needed, on favorable terms or at all. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

Cash
equivalents consist of highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less. Restricted cash is related
to contractual obligations or restricted by management and is included in other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets depending
on the timing of the restrictions. The restricted cash balance in other current assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 0.0 million.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The
preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we
evaluate our estimates to ensure they are consistent with historical experience and the various assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions and could materially impact our results of operations. 

We
believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
Consolidated Financial Statements: 

Uncertain
Tax Positions. Our income tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities. As such, we record accruals for items
that we believe may be challenged by these taxing authorities. The threshold for recognizing the benefit of a tax return position in
the consolidated financial statements is that the position must more-likely-than-not be sustained by the taxing authorities based
solely on the technical merits of the position. If the recognition threshold is met, the tax benefit is measured and recognized as
the largest amount of tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. At December 31, 2021 and
2022, our accrual related to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits was 0.0 million. 

Our
U.S. federal income tax returns for 2019 through 2021 are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. With few exceptions,
we are no longer subject to examination by foreign tax jurisdictions or state and local tax jurisdictions for years before 2016. 

The
ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require
the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense. Favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense. It
is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease significantly during the next twelve months due
to the resolution of certain U.S. and international tax uncertainties; however, it is not possible to estimate the potential change at
this time. 

Intangibles.
 We record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase transactions, including intangibles, at estimated fair value. Intangible
assets with a definite life are amortized based on a pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are consumed, typically with
useful lives ranging from one to 30 years. The initial recognition of intangible assets, the determination of useful lives and, if necessary,
subsequent impairment analysis require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform
in the future using certain valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis. We evaluate assets on our balance sheet, including
such intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors
such as unfavorable variances from forecasted cash flows, established business plans or volatility inherent to external markets and industries
may indicate a possible impairment that would require an impairment test. The test for impairment requires a comparison of the carrying
value of the asset or asset group with their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of the asset or asset group
is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds
its fair value. 

Goodwill.
 We record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill, at fair value. The initial recognition
of goodwill and subsequent impairment analysis require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired
assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis. Goodwill is the excess of the cost
of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not
amortized. We test the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter
of each year or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would warrant impairment testing during an interim period. 

14 

Goodwill
is considered impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value. The Company may assess qualitative factors to determine
whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If
we determine in this assessment that the fair value of the reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, we may conclude that there
is no need to perform Step 1 of the impairment test. We have an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting
unit in any period and proceed directly to performing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. 

Step
1 of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill was assigned to its carrying amount.
If fair value is deemed to be less than carrying value, Step 2 of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting
unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit s
goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill, an impairment loss must be recognized for the
excess. This involves measuring the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities (both recognized and unrecognized)
at the time of the impairment test. The difference between the reporting unit s fair value and the fair values assigned to the
reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill. 

Claims
and Litigation. We record a liability when a loss from a pending or threatened claim or litigation is known or considered probable
and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Stockholders and Board of Directors of GlassBridge Enterprises, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of GlassBridge Enterprises, Inc. (the Company at December 31,
2022 and 2021 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity (deficit),
and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
 financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Critical
Audit Matter Description 

As
described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company maintains a significant investment in a private company. For
investments in equity securities that do not to have a readily determinable fair value, the Company made the election to measure the
securities it holds at amortized cost in accordance with ASC 321-10-35. The Company performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether
its investment should be impaired due to any decline in fair value below cost. 

The
determination of the fair value for these securities requires significant judgment and subjective evaluation of qualitative factors.
In addition, the Company prepared a valuation model to support its determination, and the valuation process involves significant assumptions
and estimates. 

16 

How
the Critical Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

Our
principal audit procedures performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: 

- 
 Reviewed
 and assessed management s evaluation of qualitative factors and relevant events and circumstances to determine whether the
 fair value of these securities was less than the amortized cost. 

- 
 Corroborated
 that analysis with examination of internally prepared valuation model and evaluated management s assumptions and forecasts.

in principal and all other amounts due to ESW under the ESW Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the ESW Loan Agreement, AEC had given to ESW
a security interest in all of AEC s assets, and GlassBridge pledged to ESW all of GlassBridge s AEC stock and 
of GlassBridge s Sport-BLX, Inc. SportBLX stock. The Loan Agreement provided that, upon AEC s default,
AEC may elect to cooperate with ESW to effect a prearranged reorganization of AEC in bankruptcy, pursuant to which ESW would acquire
from GlassBridge all equity in AEC, as reorganized, and certain of its assets, most notably property and equipment consisting of
quantitative trading software, as well as deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses, for consideration of ,
which amount would be used to satisfy the claims of all valid creditors and certain administrative expenses associated with the
bankruptcy case, with all residual funds to be paid to GlassBridge. On April 22, 2021, AEC filed a voluntary petition for relief
under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. AEC s prepackaged
chapter 11 plan of reorganization was confirmed at a hearing on June 9, 2021 and became effective on June 15, 2021 (the
 Effective Date ). Upon the occurrence of the Effective Date, ESW paid 
million in consideration, less 
that ESW had previously funded in the form of a post-petition debtor-in-possession loan to AEC to fund the costs of administration
associated with AEC s bankruptcy case and to satisfy valid creditor claims Also on the Effective Date, by order of the
Bankruptcy Court, GlassBridge shares of AEC were canceled, and shares in reorganized AEC were issued to ESW and an affiliate. In
addition, on the Effective Date, GlassBridge received a release of its guaranty obligations to ESW. 

The
Company received distributions from the bankruptcy estate totaling in 2021 and received additional distributions of 
during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there are funds remaining in the bankruptcy estate. 

Adara
has historically been one of the subsidiaries through which the Company has operated its asset management business. The Company, however,
remains committed to its asset management business and holds various investments and assets, including Arrive LLC Arrive ),
in other subsidiaries. 

On
December 30, 2021 the Company completed the disposition of its entire interest in SportBLX, selling all of its shares to Fintech Debt
Corp. FDC for . FDC is controlled by George E. Hall and Joseph A. De Perio, who are beneficial owners of the
Company. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and
entities in which the Company owns or controls fifty percent or more of the voting shares and has the right to control. The results of
entities disposed of are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements up to the date of the disposal and, where appropriate, these
operations have been reflected as discontinued operations. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). All inter-company balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation and, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation
have been included in the results reported. 

The
operating results of the Sports Technology Platform, are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as discontinued operations
for all periods presented. Our continuing operations in each period presented represents our Asset Management Business 
as well as corporate expenses and activities not directly attributable to the Sports Technology Platform. Assets and liabilities directly
associated with the Sports Technology Platform that are not part of our ongoing operations have been separately presented on the face
of our Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations for further information. 

t have any restricted cash included in other current assets. 

Our
income tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities. As such, we record accruals for items that we believe may be
challenged by these taxing authorities. The threshold for recognizing the benefit of a tax return position in the consolidated
financial statements is that the position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the
technical merits of the position. If the recognition threshold is met, the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest
amount of tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized.

million
 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 represents an investment in the Arrive operating company, Arrive I LLC. The Company s investment entitles the Company to appoint one of five Arrive Board members and gives the Company
priority for distributions of current income and investment proceeds. In addition, 

Other assets of million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,
 represent an investment in the Arrive Opportunities Fund I, LP, managed by an affiliate of Arrive I LLC. 

The Company did not record any unrealized gains or losses during the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021 related
to these investments. The Company is not required to contribute additional capital to either of the investments. 

Historically,
the Company accounted for such investments under the cost method of accounting. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 in the first quarter
of 2018 effectively eliminated the cost method of accounting, and the carrying value of this investment is written down, or impaired,
to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary. Our strategic investment in equity securities does not
have a readily determinable fair value; therefore, the new guidance was adopted prospectively. As of December 31, 2022, there were no
indicators of impairment for this investment. The Company will assess the investment for potential impairment, quarterly. 

Other liabilities 

Total long term debt 

The
Company entered into a Term Loan and Security Agreement GHI Loan Agreement with Gazellek Holdings I, LLC GHI
LLC ), pursuant to which GHI LLC lent to the Company on August 6, 2021. The loan bears in-kind interest at the annual
rate of and interest is compounded with, and added to the outstanding amount quarterly. The loan is secured by substantially all of
the Company s assets and those of all of its subsidiaries, which are required to guarantee the loan, and matures . 

The
Company is required to prepay the loan upon receiving proceeds from future indebtedness exceeding (other than indebtedness
that is junior to the loan), or if the Company issues any capital stock (provided that the Company is allowed to retain up to 20 of
the proceeds from such issuance). The GHI Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default.

of million for the year ended December 31, 2021, was attributable to post petition fees in connection with the bankruptcy and was
allocated to the asset management business. 

The
2011 Incentive Plan was approved and adopted by our stockholders on May 4, 2011 and became effective immediately. The 2011 Incentive
Plan was amended and approved by our stockholders on May 8, 2013. The 2011 Incentive Plan permits the grant of stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalents, performance awards, stock awards and other stock-based awards.
The number of shares available for awards, as well as the terms of outstanding awards, is subject to adjustments as provided in the 2011
Incentive Plan for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalization and other similar events. Awards were able to be granted under the
2011 Incentive Plan until the earlier to occur of May 3, 2021 or the date on which all shares available for awards under the 2011 Incentive
Plan have been granted; provided, however, that incentive stock options may not be granted after February 10, 2021. Prior to its expiration,
the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable under all stock-based awards made under the 2011 Incentive Plan was . 

Stock-based
compensation awards issued under the 2011 Incentive Plan generally have a term of ten years and, for employees, vest over a three-year
period. Exercise prices of awards issued under these plans are equal to the fair value of the Company s stock on the date of grant. 

As
of December 31, 2022, there were outstanding stock-based compensation awards under the 2011 Incentive Plan. As of December 31,
2022, there were shares available for grant under our 2011 Incentive Plan.

The
2020 tax law change that had the most significant impact was in the CARES Act, which accelerated the refund schedule for alternative
minimum tax credit carryovers. The Company had recorded a tax benefit of million in 2017-2018 which was originally scheduled to
be received as cash refunds in 2019 through 2022. The CARES Act allowed the Company to file a refund claim for the entire remaining balance
of million which was received (with interest) in February 2021. 

Tax
laws require certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations.
Some of these items are temporary differences that will reverse over time. We record the tax effect of temporary differences as deferred
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

In
2022 and 2021 the net cash paid for income taxes, relating to both continuing and discontinued operations, was million.

We
regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered in the future. A valuation allowance is recorded to the
extent we conclude a deferred tax asset is not considered more-likely-than-not to be realized. We consider all positive and negative
evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. 

Our
accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events. A valuation allowance established or revised
as a result of our assessment is recorded through income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in our current
estimates due to unanticipated events, or other factors, could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

We
maintain a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was million and million as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The deferred tax asset changes and corresponding valuation allowance changes in 2022 compared
to 2021 were due primarily to a reduction in the 2021 tax loss calculation related to the Chapter 11 reorganization of Adara. 

The
net deferred tax liability not offset by valuation allowance of million relates to foreign tax withholding on unremitted foreign
earnings. 

Total 

Federal
net operating loss carryforwards totaling million will begin expiring in . This net operating loss includes a million
worthless stock deduction for the 2021 Adara Chapter 11 reorganization. 

The
Company performed an analysis to confirm that none of the federal net operating loss carryovers should be limited by Section 382. 
No such ownership shift has occurred through December 31, 2022. 

We
have federal capital losses of million that will expire between 2024 and 2026. General business credits totaling million
will expire between 2024 and 2032. Various state income tax losses and tax credits are also available to offset future profits in six
states. 

Our
income tax returns are subject to review by various U.S. and foreign taxing authorities. As such, we record accruals for items that
we believe may be challenged by these taxing authorities. The threshold for recognizing the benefit of a tax return position in the
consolidated financial statements is that the position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based
solely on the technical merits of the position. If the recognition threshold is met, the tax benefit is measured and recognized as
the largest amount of tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized.

 additional shares. The remaining common stock included in treasury shares relates to restricted stock forfeitures and

Rights Agreement 

On
November 30, 2021, the Board of Directors adopted a rights plan intended to avoid an ownership change within the meaning
of Section 382 of the Code, and thereby preserve the current ability of the Company to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards
and other tax benefits of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Tax Benefits ). If the Company experiences an ownership
change, as defined in Section 382 of Code, the Company s ability to fully utilize the Tax Benefits on an annual basis will
be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the Tax Benefits and such other benefits could be substantially delayed, which
could therefore significantly impair the value of those assets. The rights plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or group
acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock, without the approval
of the Board. The description and terms of the Rights (as defined below) applicable to the rights plan are set forth in the 382 Rights
Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2021 (the Rights Agreement ), by and between the Company and Equiniti Trust Company,
as Rights Agent. 

As
part of the Rights Agreement, the Board authorized and declared a dividend distribution of one right (a Right) for each outstanding share
of the Company s common stock, to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 1, 2021. Each Right entitles the
holder to purchase from the Company a unit consisting of one one-hundredth of a share (a Unit of Series A Participating
Preferred Stock, par value per share, of the Company (the Preferred Stock at a purchase price of per Unit,
subject to adjustment (the Purchase Price ). Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no separate
rights as a stockholder of the Company, including the right to vote or to receive dividends in respect of Rights. 

Under
the Rights Agreement, an Acquiring Person is any person or group of affiliated or associated persons (a Person who is
or becomes the beneficial owner of or more of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock other than as a result
of repurchases of stock by the Company, dividends or distribution by the Company, stock issued under certain benefit plans or certain
inadvertent actions by stockholders. For purposes of calculating percentage ownership under the Rights Agreement, outstanding shares
of the Company s common stock include all of the shares of common stock actually issued and outstanding. Beneficial ownership is
determined as provided in the Rights Agreement and generally includes, without limitation, any ownership of securities a Person would
be deemed to actually or constructively own for purposes of Section 382 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
The Rights Agreement provides that the following shall not be deemed an Acquiring Person for purposes of the Rights Agreement: (i) the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company and any employee benefit plan of the Company, or of any subsidiary of the Company, or any Person
or entity organized, appointed or established by the Company for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan or (ii) any Person that, as
of December 1, 2021, is the beneficial owner of or more of the shares of Common Stock outstanding (such Person, an Existing
Holder unless and until such Existing Holder acquires beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock (other than pursuant
to a dividend or distribution paid or made by the Company on the outstanding shares of common stock or pursuant to a split or subdivision
of the outstanding shares of common stock) in an amount in excess of of the outstanding shares of common stock. 

The
Rights Agreement provides that a Person shall not become an Acquiring Person for purpose of the Rights Agreement in a transaction that
the Board determines is exempt from the Rights Agreement, which determination shall be made in the sole and absolute discretion of the
Board, upon request by any Person prior to the date upon which such Person would otherwise become an Acquiring Person, including, without

9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Based on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Chief Executive
Officer, Daniel Strauss, and Chief Financial Officer, Francis Ruchalski, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were
effective. 

Changes
in Internal Controls. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Management of GlassBridge is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. GlassBridge s internal control system is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

GlassBridge
management assessed the effectiveness of GlassBridge s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making
this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control Integrated Framework version 2013 . Based on our assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, GlassBridge s
internal control over financial reporting was effective, based on those criteria.

Related
Party Transactions 

On
July 31, 2021, Mr. Hall and Mr. De Perio agreed to accept 2,354,736 and 1,060,264, respectively, from the Company in satisfaction of
its obligations to them in the amounts of 12,116,718 and 5,455,782, respectively. The obligations were due December 12, 2022 and bore
interest at a 5 annual rate. Accordingly, GLAE s obligations in the amounts of 12,116,718 and 5,455,782 have been paid in full. 

Also
on July 31, 2021, as part of the settlement of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company assigned obligations owed to it from Sport-BLX,
totaling 4,176,102, to FDC, of which Mr. Hall and Mr. De Perio are controlling stockholders, for 400,000. 

The
net gain on the settlement of the Stock Purchase Agreement and the assignment of obligations to FDC are related party gains, and, as
such, were recorded as equity transactions in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, rather than recognized as income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

On
December 30, 2021, the Company completed a series of transactions for the purpose of disposing of its interest in SportBLX, described
below: 

On
 December 21, 2021, SportBLX sold proprietary code to S-BLX Securities, a related party, for
 225,000. 

On
 December 24, 2021, SportBLX repurchased 1,500,000 of its debt from FDC, a related party,
 for 126,000. FDC is controlled by George E. Hall and Joseph A. De Perio, who are beneficial
 owners of the Company. 

Finally,
 on December 30, 2021, the Company completed the disposition of its entire interest in SportBLX,
 selling all of its shares to FDC for 137,038.

Related
Person Transaction Policy 

In
accordance with our policy regarding transactions with related persons, our Chief Financial Officer and the Audit and Finance Committee
are responsible for the review and approval of all transactions with related persons that are required to be disclosed under the rules
of the SEC. Under the policy, a related person includes any of our directors or executive officers, certain of our stockholders
and any of their respective immediate family members. The policy applies to transactions in which the Company is a participant, the amount
involved exceeds 120,000, and a related person has a direct or indirect material interest. A related person s material interest
in a transaction is to be determined based on the significance of the information to investors in light of all the circumstances. Under
the policy, key management meets quarterly to review the list of related parties and to discuss related party transactions. The Audit
and Finance Committee also reviews each new, existing or proposed related party transaction, including the terms of the transaction,
the business purpose of the transaction, and the benefits to GlassBridge and to the relevant related party. In determining whether to
approve a related party transaction, the Audit and Finance Committee will consider the factors it deems relevant to the related party
transaction, including, among other things, whether the terms of the related party transaction are fair to the Company on the same basis
as would apply if the transaction did not involve a related party. 

Director
Independence 

Our
Board of Directors has reviewed whether our directors and nominees are independent. Our Board considers to not be independent
any person having a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the person s responsibilities
as a director. The following persons will be considered not independent: 

a
 director who is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer or
 employee of the Company; 

a
 director who accepted or has a family member who accepted any compensation from the Company
 exceeding 120,000 during any year within the three years preceding the determination of
 independence, other than compensation for Board or Board committee service; compensation
 paid to a family member who is an employee (other than an executive officer) of the Company;
 or benefits under a tax-qualified retirement plan or nondiscretionary compensation; or 

a
 director who is a family member of a person who is, or at any time during the past three
 years was, employed by the Company as an executive officer. 

Family
member means a person s spouse, parents, children, and siblings, whether by birth, marriage, or adoption, or anyone residing
in that person s home. 

None
of the directors or nominees, except Mr. De Perio, had a relationship with the Company that the Board considers would interfere with
the director s or nominee s independence or would not be independent under the enumerated criteria. Therefore, the Board
determined that each of the directors and nominees, except Mr. De Perio, is independent. 

In
2022, the Board also reviewed whether the Audit and Finance Committee had an audit committee financial expert as defined in the SEC rules
and the OTCQB rules. The Board reviewed the skills and experience required under the rules and determined that Mr. Searing qualifies
as an audit committee financial expert as defined under those rules.

All
the services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm are subject to pre-approval by the Audit and Finance Committee.

respect to each proposed pre-approved service, our independent registered public accounting firm provides back-up documentation as requested,
including estimated fees regarding the specific services to be provided. The Audit and Finance Committee (or its Chairman, as applicable)
reviews the services and the estimated fees and considers whether approval of the proposed services will have a detrimental impact on
our independent registered public accounting firm s independence prior to approving any service. At least annually, a member of
our management reports to the Audit and Finance Committee all audit and non-audit services performed during the previous twelve months
and all fees billed by our independent registered public accounting firm for those services.

DESCRIPTION
OF REGISTRANT S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 

References
to Glassbridge and the Company herein are, unless the context otherwise indicates, only to Glassbridge Enterprises
, Inc. and not to any of its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
Glassbridge has two classes of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ), the Company s Preferred Stock Purchase Rights and Common Stock. 

The
following description of the Company s capital stock and provisions of the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Certificate of Correction, Amended and Restated Bylaws
and the Delaware General Corporation Law are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Company s Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Certificate of Correction
and Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws. Copies of these documents have been filed with the SEC as exhibits to the Annual Report
on Form 10-K to which this description has been filed as an exhibit. Pursuant to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation and Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as corrected by the Certificate of Correction
dated May 21, 2020, the Company s authorized capital stock is 250,000, consisting of 50,000 shares of common stock, par value of
 0.01 per share (referred to as the Company s common stock), and 200,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share (referred
to as the Company s preferred stock), to be designated from time to time by the Company s board of directors. 

Common
Stock 

Holders
of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on any matter to be voted upon by stockholders. All shares rank equally as to voting
and all other matters. The shares of common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights, no redemption or sinking fund provisions,
are not liable for further call or assessment and are not entitled to cumulative voting rights. For as long as such stock is outstanding,
the holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably any dividends when and as declared from time to time by Company s board
of directors out of funds legally available for dividends. Upon a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary,
creditors will be paid before any distribution to holders of common stock. After such distribution, holders of common stock are entitled
to receive a pro rata distribution per share of any excess amount. As of April 7, 2023, there were 25,170 shares of common stock outstanding. 

Preferred
Stock Purchase Right 

In
November 2021, the Company s board of directors adopted a rights plan intended to avoid an ownership change within
the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, and thereby preserve the current ability of the Company to utilize certain net operating loss
carryforwards and other tax benefits of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Tax Benefits ). If the Company experiences
an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of Code, the Company s ability to fully utilize the Tax Benefits on
an annual basis will be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the Tax Benefits and such other benefits could be substantially
delayed, which could therefore significantly impair the value of those assets. The rights plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any
person or group acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9 or more of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock,
without the approval of the board. The description and terms of the Rights (as defined below) applicable to the rights plan are set forth
in the 382 Rights Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2021 (the Rights Agreement ), by and between the Company and Equiniti
Trust Company, as Rights Agent. 

As
part of the Rights Agreement, the board authorized and declared a dividend distribution of one right (a Right for each
outstanding share of the Company s common stock, to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 1, 2021. Each Right
entitles the holder to purchase from the Company a unit consisting of one one-hundredth of a share (a Unit of Series A
Participating Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share, of the Company (the Preferred Stock at a purchase price of 
1,000.00 per Unit, subject to adjustment (the Purchase Price ). Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such,
will have no separate rights as a stockholder of the Company, including the right to vote or to receive dividends in respect of Rights. 

Under
the Rights Agreement, an Acquiring Person is any person or group of affiliated or associated persons (a Person who is or becomes the beneficial owner of 4.9 or more of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock other than as a
result of repurchases of stock by the Company, dividends or distribution by the Company, stock issued under certain benefit plans or
certain inadvertent actions by stockholders. For purposes of calculating percentage ownership under the Rights Agreement, outstanding
shares of the Company s common stock include all of the shares of common stock actually issued and outstanding. Beneficial ownership
is determined as provided in the Rights Agreement and generally includes, without limitation, any ownership of securities a Person would
be deemed to actually or constructively own for purposes of Section 382 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
The Rights Agreement provides that the following shall not be deemed an Acquiring Person for purposes of the Rights Agreement: (i) the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company and any employee benefit plan of the Company, or of any subsidiary of the Company, or any Person
or entity organized, appointed or established by the Company for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan or (ii) any Person that, as
of December 1, 2021, is the beneficial owner of 4.9 or more of the shares of Common Stock outstanding (such Person, an Existing
Holder unless and until such Existing Holder acquires beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock (other than pursuant
to a dividend or distribution paid or made by the Company on the outstanding shares of common stock or pursuant to a split or subdivision
of the outstanding shares of common stock) in an amount in excess of 0.5 of the outstanding shares of common stock. 

The
Rights Agreement provides that a Person shall not become an Acquiring Person for purpose of the Rights Agreement in a transaction that
the board determines is exempt from the Rights Agreement, which determination shall be made in the sole and absolute discretion of the
board, upon request by any Person prior to the date upon which such Person would otherwise become an Acquiring Person, including, without
limitation, if the board determines that (i) neither the beneficial ownership of shares of common stock by such Person, directly or indirectly,
as a result of such transaction nor any other aspect of such transaction would jeopardize or endanger the availability to the Company
of the Tax Benefits or (ii) such transaction is otherwise in the best interests of the Company. 

Initially,
the Rights will not be exercisable and will be attached to all common stock representing shares then outstanding, and no separate Rights
certificates will be distributed. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the Rights Agreement, the Rights will separate from the
common stock and become exercisable and a distribution date (a Distribution Date will occur upon the earlier of (i) 10
business days (or such later date as the board shall determine) following a public announcement that a Person has become an Acquiring
Person or (ii) 10 business days (or such later date as the board shall determine) following the commencement of a tender offer, exchange
offer or other transaction that, upon consummation thereof, would result in a Person becoming an Acquiring Person. 

Until
the Distribution Date, common stock held in book-entry form, or in the case of certificated shares, common stock certificates, will evidence
the Rights and will contain a notation to that effect. Any transfer of shares of common stock prior to the Distribution Date will constitute
a transfer of the associated Rights. After the Distribution Date, the Rights may be transferred on the books and records of the Rights
Agent as provided in the Rights Agreement. 

If
on or after the Distribution Date, a Person is or becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right, other than certain Rights including
those beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will have become void), will have the right to receive upon exercise common stock
(or, in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company) having a value equal to two times the Purchase Price. 

In
the event that, at any time following the first date of a public announcement that a Person has become an Acquiring Person or that discloses
information which reveals the existence of an Acquiring Person or such earlier date as a majority of the board becomes aware of the existence
of an Acquiring Person (any such date, the Stock Acquisition Date ), (i) the Company engages in a merger or other business
combination transaction in which the Company is not the surviving corporation, (ii) the Company engages in a merger or other business
combination transaction in which the Company is the surviving corporation and the common stock of the Company is changed or exchanged
or (iii) 50 or more of the Company s assets, cash flow or earning power is sold or transferred, each holder of a Right (except
Rights which have previously been voided as set forth above) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, common stock
of the acquiring company having a value equal to two times the Purchase Price. 

At
any time following the Stock Acquisition Date and prior to the acquisition by the Acquiring Person of 50 or more of the outstanding
common stock, the board may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such Person which have become void), in whole or in part,
for common stock or Preferred Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock, or one one-hundredth of a share of Preferred Stock
(or of a share of a class or series of the Company s preferred stock having equivalent rights, preferences and privileges), per
Right, subject to adjustment. 

The
Rights and the Rights Agreement will expire on the earliest of (i) 5:00 P.M. New York City time on December 1, 2024, (ii) the time at
which the Rights are redeemed or exchanged pursuant to the Rights Agreement, (iii) the date on which the board determines that the Rights
Agreement is no longer necessary for the preservation of material valuable Tax Benefits or is no longer in the best interest of the Company
and its stockholders, (iv) the beginning of a taxable year to which the board determines that no Tax Benefits may be carried forward. 

At
any time until the earlier of the Distribution Date or the expiration date of the Rights, the Company may redeem the Rights in whole,
but not in part, at a price of 0.001 per Right. Immediately upon the action of the board ordering redemption of the Rights, the Rights
will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the 0.001 redemption price. 

Preferred
Stock 

Under
the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company s board of directors has authority to issue
up to 200,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. The Company s board of directors may also determine or alter
for each class of preferred stock the voting powers, designations, preferences, and special rights, qualifications, limitations, or restrictions
as permitted by law. The Company s board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights
that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. Issuing preferred stock provides flexibility
in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, but could also, among other things, have the effect of delaying,
deferring or preventing a change in control of Glassbridge and may adversely affect the market price of the Company s common stock
and the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. 

The
Company s board of directors will fix the rights, preferences, privileges, qualifications and restrictions of the preferred stock
of each series that Glassbridge issues in the certificate of designation relating to that series. This will include: 

the title and
 stated value; 

the number of shares being
 authorized; 

the liquidation preference
 per share; 

the purchase price per
 share; 

the currency for which
 the shares may be purchased; 

the dividend rate per share,
 dividend period and payment dates and method of calculation for dividends; 

whether dividends will
 be cumulative or non-cumulative and, if cumulative, the date from which dividends will accumulate; 

the Company s
 right, if any, to defer payment of dividends and the maximum length of any such deferral period; 

the procedures for any
 auction and remarketing, if any; 

the provisions
 for a sinking fund, if any; 

the provisions for redemption
 or repurchase, if applicable, and any restrictions on the Company s ability to exercise those redemption and repurchase rights; 

any listing of the preferred
 stock on any securities exchange or market; 

whether the preferred stock
 will be convertible into the Company s common stock or other securities of the Company, and, if applicable, the conversion
 period, the conversion price, or how it will be calculated, and under what circumstances it may be adjusted; 

voting rights, if any,
 of the preferred stock; 

restrictions on transfer,
 sale or other assignment, if any; 

the relative ranking and
 preferences of the preferred stock as to dividend rights and rights if the Company liquidates, dissolves or winds up its affairs; 

any limitations on issuances
 of any class or series of preferred stock ranking senior to or on a parity with the series of preferred stock being issued as to
 dividend rights and rights if the Company liquidates, dissolves or winds up its affairs; and 

any other specific terms,
 rights, preferences, privileges, qualifications or restrictions of the preferred stock. 

As
of April 7, 2023 , there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding. 

Certain
Anti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law and Provisions of Glassbridge s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 

The
Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws include a number of provisions that
may have the effect of encouraging persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals to negotiate
with the Company s board of directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. These provisions include: 

No
 written consent of stockholders . The Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that all stockholder
 actions are required to be taken by a vote of the stockholders at an annual or special meeting, and that stockholders may not take
 any action by written consent in lieu of a meeting. 

Meetings
 of stockholders and the board . A majority of the total number of authorized directors shall constitute a quorum at any meeting
 of the board of directors. The Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws limit the business that may be conducted at an annual
 meeting of stockholders to those matters properly brought before the meeting. At any meeting of stockholders (at which a quorum was
 present to organize the meeting), all matters, except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation or the
 Bylaws, shall be decided by a majority of the votes cast for and against such matter at such meeting by the holders of shares present
 in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, regardless whether a quorum is present when the vote is taken. For
 clarity, abstentions are not votes cast. 

Advance
 notice requirements . The Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder
 proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or new business to be brought before meetings of stockholders.
 These procedures provide that notice of stockholder proposals must be timely given in writing to Glassbridge s corporate secretary
 prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. Generally, to be timely, notice must be received at the Company s
 principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the 90th day, prior to the first anniversary date of the annual
 meeting for the preceding year; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within
 thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so received before
 the later (a) of the close of business on the twenty-first (21st) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual
 meeting was mailed or the day on which public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs and (b)
 the close of business on the day which is ninety (90) days prior to the date of the annual meeting. The notice must contain certain
 information specified in the Amended and Restated Bylaws. 

Amendment
 to bylaws and certificate of incorporation . As required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, any amendment of the Company s
 Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation must first be approved by a majority of the Company s board of directors
 and 80 percent of the voting power of all of the shares of capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote generally in
 any election of directors, voting together as a single class. The Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws may be amended by the
 affirmative vote of a majority vote of the directors then in officeor by the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of the voting
 power of all of the shares of capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote generally in any election of directors, voting
 together as a single class. 

Blank check preferred
 stock . As described above, the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes 200,000 shares of
 preferred stock. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock may enable Glassbridge s board of directors
 to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of Glassbridge by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest,
 or otherwise. For example, if in the due exercise of its fiduciary obligations, the Company s board of directors were to determine
 that a takeover proposal is not in the best interests of the Company or its stockholders, the board of directors could cause shares
 of preferred stock to be issued without stockholder approval in one or more private offerings or other transactions that might dilute
 the voting or other rights of the proposed acquirer or insurgent stockholder or stockholder group. In this regard, the Company s
 Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation grants the board of directors broad power to establish the rights and preferences
 of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings
 and assets available for distribution to holders of shares. The issuance may also adversely affect the rights and powers, including
 voting rights, of these holders and may have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change in control of Glassbridge. 

In
addition, Glassbridge is subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits
a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder 
for a three-year period following the time that this stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is
approved in a prescribed manner. A business combination includes, among other things, a merger, asset or stock sale, or
other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person
who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or did own within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder
status, 15 or more of the corporation s voting stock. 

Because
of these provisions, persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate
with the Company s board of directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. As a result, these provisions may make
it more difficult for stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors.
