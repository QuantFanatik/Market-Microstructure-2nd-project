NOTE
ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The
information contained in this Report includes some statements that are not purely historical and that are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and as such, may involve risks and uncertainties. These
forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, perceived opportunities
in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other
characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. You can generally
identify forward-looking statements as statements containing the words anticipates, believes, continue, 
 could, estimates, expects, intends, may, might, plans, 
 possible, potential, predicts, projects, seeks, should, 
 will, would and similar expressions, or the negatives of such terms, but the absence of these words does
not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 

Forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the
forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on various assumptions, many of which are based,
in turn, upon further assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and forward-looking statements are expressed in good faith on the basis
of management s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made, but there can be no assurance that management s
expectations, beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished. 

In
addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere herein, the following are important factors that, in our view, could cause
actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements: technological advances, impact of competition,
dependence on key personnel and the need to attract new management, effectiveness of cost and marketing efforts, acceptances of products,
ability to expand markets and the availability of capital or other funding on terms satisfactory to us. We disclaim any obligation to
update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof. 

Unless
expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms Landbay, company, we, us, 
and our in this document refer to Landbay Inc, a New York corporation.

PART
I 

Item
1. Business. 

History
and Overview 

Landbay
Inc is a New York corporation formed on January 28, 2016. Our current principle executive office is located at 36-25 Main Street, Flushing,
New York, 11354. Tel: 917-232-5799. 

On
July 24, 2019, Larison Inc, the principal stockholder and 100 controlled by the prior President of the Company Seller ),
entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement with Northern Ifurniture Inc (the Buyer ). Pursuant
to the Agreement, Seller agreed to sell to the Buyer and the Buyer agreed to purchase from Seller a total of 9,222,350 shares of common
stock of the Company Purchased Shares, which represented approximately 96 of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common
stock. As a result, the transaction led to a change of the control and the management team of the Company. 

Prior
to the change of the management team, the Company was engaging in holding or trading securities in the US market, as well as to trade
and hold whisky in the UK market. The Company has changed its focus to operate furniture retail business and furniture design business
in the New York area. 

The
Board of the Directors approved to amend the Article of the Company to reduce the Company s authorized common stock from 999,000,000
shares to 30,000,000 shares on August 15, 2019. On April 29, 2021, the Company amended its article
with New York State to increase the authorized Class A common shares with a par value of 0.001 to
 100,000,000 shares, and to add 20,000,000 shares
of preferred stock with a par value of 0.001 . 

The
Company continues to look for other opportunities which could potentially increase the profits of the Company in the year 2023. 

Our
Products 

We
market and retail modern residential and commercial furniture in Greater New York Region. Our products feature urban and contemporary
styles, combining comfort and functionality in matching furniture collections and upscale luxury pieces appealing to lifestyle-conscious
middle-income consumers. Our furniture brands come from different countries including Italy, China, Vietnam, Malaysia and so forth, and
our products feature upholstered, wood and metal-based furniture pieces. We classify our products by room, designation or series, such
as living room, dining room, bedroom and home office series, and by category or product types such as sofas, chairs, dining tables, beds,
entertainment consoles, cabinets and cupboards. 

We
identify the latest trends and customer needs in our target markets to purchase new products, collections and brands from worldwide.
Our product collections are designed to appeal to consumer preferences in specific markets. We retail both individual furniture pieces
and complete furniture collections that equip an entire home which feature matching furniture suites, providing convenient home furnishing
options for lifestyle-conscious consumers. We also provide a one-stop service to our customers which we design their decoration and introduce
proper furniture to match the style. 

We
generally introduce our products at our showroom which locates at 36-25 Main Street, Flushing, New York, 11354. We believe that such
in-store presentations provide convenient, one-stop solutions to customers, and thus incentivize clients to purchase an entire room of
furniture from us instead of shopping for individual pieces offered by different brands or manufacturers. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Our
sales and marketing strategies target middle class, urban consumers, including: (1) direct sales to the Great New York Region customers;
(2) onsite marketing campaigns. 

We
diversify our customer base by increasing direct sales to Great New York Region customers. We gain new customers by advertising and introduced
by our existed customers. We also visit different furniture brands a few times each year to help us to develop and detect the latest-trends
in the marketplace, allowing us to better understand the challenges and opportunities facing different customer requirements. 

In
2023, we plan to seek more attractive furniture brands to expand our customer base and different consumer groups. 

4 

Competition 

The
furniture industry is large and highly competitive. The industry consists of many manufacturers, distributors and retailers, none of
which dominates the fragmented and diverse market. Our products principally compete in the Great New York Region market. The primary
competitive factors in the market for our products and target consumers are price, quality, style, marketing, functionality and availability.
In addition to our selective modern furniture brands from the worldwide to fulfill different customer requirements, our President, Ms.
Xiaowei Jin, has extensive experience in the furniture industry with 6 years of practical operation of the furniture business. We believe
that our experience from the management will significantly benefits to our customers, as well as the operation of the Company. 

Government
Regulations 

Our
operations are subject to various laws and regulations domestically. In the U.S., federal, state and local regulations impose standards
on our workplace and our relationship with the environment. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Safety
and Health Administration and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that may impact our operations. In
particular, we are subject to legislation placing restrictions on our generation, emission, treatment, storage and disposal of materials,
substances and wastes. Such legislation includes: the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Clean
Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Safe Drinking Water Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response and the Compensation and Liability
Act (also known as Superfund). We are also subject to the requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade
Commission, in addition to regulations concerning employee health and safety matters. We believe the Company has complied with the relevant
federal, state, local and international requirements for environmental protection.

Market
Information 

There
has only been limited trading for the Company s Common Stock since it began trading on March 24, 2021. There is no assurance that
an active trading market will ever develop or, if such a market does develop, that it will continue. The Securities and Exchange Commission
has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a penny stock, for purposes relevant to the Company, as any
equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject
to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (i) that a broker or dealer approve
a person s account for transactions in penny stocks and (ii) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement
to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person s
account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must (i) obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives
of the person and (ii) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that person
has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The
broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating
to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form, (i) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination
and (ii) that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Disclosure also has
to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading, and about commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available
to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information
for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. 

Because
of these regulations, broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to buy or sell shares of our common stock, which may
affect the ability of our shareholders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading
activity in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our common stock
in the marketplace. In addition, the liquidity for our common stock may be decreased, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our
common stock. Our shares are likely to be subject to such penny stock rules for the foreseeable future. 

On
September 28, 2020, our class A common stock was approved for quotation on the OTC Markets under the symbol LNBY . The OTC
Markets is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices, and volume information in over-the-counter
equity securities. The OTC Markets securities are traded by a community of market makers that enter quotes and trade reports. This market
is limited in comparison to the national stock exchanges and any prices quoted may not be a reliable indication of the value of our class
A common stock. 

On
June 28, 2023, the closing price of our common stock reported on the OTC Markets was 0.51 per share. The following table sets forth,
for each of the quarterly periods indicated, the high and low closing prices of our class A common stock, as reported on the OTC Markets.

The

as of March 31, 2023, and 2022 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included
elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 

Overview 

Landbay
Inc is a New York corporation formed on January 28, 2016. Our current principle executive office is located at 36-25 Main Street, Flushing,
New York, 11354. Tel: 917-232-5799. 

On
July 24, 2019, Larison Inc, the principal stockholder and 100 controlled by the prior President of the Company Seller ),
entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement with Northern Ifurniture Inc (the Buyer ). Pursuant
to the Agreement, Seller agreed to sell to the Buyer and the Buyer agreed to purchase from Seller a total of 9,222,350 shares of common
stock of the Company Purchased Shares, which represented approximately 96 of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common
stock. As a result, the transaction led to a change of the control and the management team of the Company. 

Prior
to the change of the management team, the Company was engaging in holding or trading securities in the US market, as well as to trade
and hold whisky in the UK market. The Company has changed its focus to operate furniture retail business and furniture design business
in the New York area. 

The
Company also continues to look for other opportunities which could potentially increase the profits of the Company in the year 2023. 

Results
of Operation for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 

During
the year ended March 31, 2023, the Company generated sales revenue in the amount of 18,188. During the year ended March 31, 2022, the
Company generated revenue in the amount of 9,572 for sales of furniture. The increase in revenue was mainly due to the increased sales
of furniture revenue for the year ended March 31, 2023 as compared with the year ended March 31, 2022. During the years ended March 31,
2023 and 2022, the Company s operating expenses were at 47,876 and 49,501, respectively. The decrease of operating expenses was
due to the decrease in legal expenses. For the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, our net loss was 37,667 and 44,596, respectively.
The decrease in net loss was mainly due to increase in gross profits from sales for the year ended March 31, 2023, and decrease in operating
expenses, as compared to 2022. 

Equity
and Capital Resources 

As
of March 31, 2023 and 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of 439,914 and 402,247, respectively. As of March 31, 2023, we had cash of
 8,105 and working capital deficiency of 84,255. As of March 31, 2022, we had cash of 26,140 and a working capital deficiency of 46,588.
The increase in the working capital deficiency was primarily due to the cash paid for operating expense. 

Going
Concern Assessment 

The
Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically cash outflow from operating activities, operating losses, accumulated
deficit and other adverse key financial ratios. 

Management s
plan to alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern include attempting to improve
its business profitability, its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations to meet its operating needs on a timely
basis, obtain additional working capital funds from the majority shareholder and the President of the Company to eliminate inefficiencies
in order to meet its anticipated cash requirements. However, there can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be sufficient
to fund the Company s ongoing capital expenditures and other requirements. 

8 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
is material to stockholders. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses.
These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding
the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions included in Note 2 of our financial statements is critical to an understanding
of our financial statements.

Opinion on the
Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance
sheets of Landbay Inc (the Company as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operation, stockholders 
equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 31,
2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Substantial
Doubt About the Company s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note
3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has a net capital deficiency, and has stated
that substantial doubt exists about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
evaluation of the events and conditions and management s
plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

Critical audit matters are matters
arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the board of
directors and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed with an objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed with an objective
of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, in order
to allow timely consideration regarding required disclosures. 

The
evaluation of our disclosure controls by our principal executive officer included a review of the controls objectives and design,
the operation of the controls, and the effect of the controls on the information presented in this Annual Report. Our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls can or will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud, if any.
A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Also, projections of any evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures to future periods are subject
to the risk that the disclosure controls and procedures may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that there were material weaknesses
in our internal controls over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023 and they were therefore not as effective as they could be to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.
The material weaknesses in our controls and procedures were lack of US GAAP knowledge and segregation duties. Management does not believe
that any of these material weaknesses materially affected the results and accuracy of its financial statements. However, in view of this
discovery of such weaknesses, management has begun a review to improve them. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company in accordance
with as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the (i) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (ii) reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and (iii)
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Our internal controls framework is based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control
- Integrated Framework that was issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management s
assessment of the effectiveness of the small business issuer s internal control over financial reporting is as of the year ended
March 31, 2023. We believe that internal controls over financial reporting as set forth above shows material weaknesses and are not effective.
We have identified material weaknesses considering the nature and extent of our current operations and any risks or errors in financial
reporting under current operations. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Subsequent
to the end of the period covered by this report, and in light of the weakness described above, management is in the process of designing
and implementing improvements in its internal control over financial reporting and we currently plan tom hire an independent third-party
consultant to assist in identifying and determining the appropriate accounting procedures and controls to implement.

industry during the past four years furniture operations, and she also collects a large amount of customer resource in the Great New

Term
of office 

All
officers and directors listed above will remain in office until the next annual meeting of our stockholders, and until their successors
have been duly elected and qualified or until removed from office in accordance with our bylaws. There are no agreements with respect
to the election of Directors. We have not compensated our Directors for service on our Board of Directors, any committee thereof, or
reimbursed for expenses incurred for attendance at meetings of our Board of Directors and/or any committee of our Board of Directors.
Officers are appointed annually by our Board of Directors and each Executive Officer serves at the discretion of our Board of Directors.
We do not have any standing committees. Our Board of Directors may in the future determine to pay Directors fees and reimburse
Directors for expenses related to their activities.

of our Officers and/or Directors have filed any bankruptcy petition, been convicted of or been the subject of any criminal proceedings
or the subject of any order, judgment or decree involving the violation of any state or federal securities laws within the past five

Director
Independence 

The
Board consists of only one member, who does not meet the independence requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market as currently in effect. 

Committees
and Terms 

The
Board of Directors (the Board has not established any committees. The Company will notify its shareholders for an annual
shareholder meeting and that they may present proposals for inclusion in the Company s proxy statement to be mailed in connection
with any such annual meeting; such proposals must be received by the Company at least 90 days prior to the meeting. No other specific
policy has been adopted in regard to the inclusion of shareholder nominations to the Board of Directors. 

Code
of Ethics 

To
date, we have not adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer because the
Company has no meaningful operations. The Company does not believe that a formal written code of ethics is necessary at this time. We
expect that the Company will adopt a code of ethics if and when the Company successfully completes a business combination that results
in the acquisition of an on-going business and thereby commences operations. 

11 

Corporate
Governance 

There
have been no changes in any state law or other procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors.
In addition to having no nominating committee for this purpose, we currently have no specific audit committee and no audit committee
financial expert. Based on the fact that our current business affairs are simple, any such committees are excessive and beyond the scope
of our business and needs. 

Nominating
Committee 

We
have not adopted any procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. 

Audit
Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert 

We
do not currently have an audit committee financial expert, nor do we have an audit committee. Our entire board of directors, which currently
consists of Xiaowei Jin, handles the functions that would otherwise be handled by an audit committee. We do not currently have the capital
resources to pay director fees to a qualified independent expert who would be willing to serve on our board and who would be willing
to act as an audit committee financial expert. As our business expands and as we appoint others to our board of directors, we expect
that we will seek a qualified independent expert to become a member of our board of directors. Before retaining any such expert our board
would make a determination as to whether such person is independent.
