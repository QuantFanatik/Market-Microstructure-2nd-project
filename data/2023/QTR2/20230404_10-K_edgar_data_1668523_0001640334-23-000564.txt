Since 2017 until late 2018 we stopped the printing business and focused on advising investors on the Asia real estate market, specifically in Cambodia. This is also how we decided in Q2/2019 to enter into discussions about production of medical devices in Cambodia. 5 Table of Contents On August 28, 2019 and July 12, 2020 we signed the Asset Assignment Agreement which stipulates the acquisition of certain brand and production rights from Prejex Holding GmbH in Germany, which allow us the production and distribution of certain needle free injection devices globally. At the time of this document the Company is working with its partners in Germany on an updated version of its needle free injector device. With production capacities on standby, management has also begun the process of preparing update filings for re-admission with the FDA in the USA and, at the same time are in discussions with potential OEM partners for the product s market roll-out in the Middle and Near East. The Company is determined to start building cash flows in the medical devices area as quickly as possible. Market Overview Other than applying our network in Cambodia in real estate and private infrastructure to identify potential production sites, our most recent inclusion of the medical devices space with the needle free injection technology has led us to put more focus on a US market roll-out for the ready produced devices. According to Datamonitor Healthcare, 35 of global prescription sales for the top 50 pharmaceutical companies were attributed to injectable drugs, with sales growing at 43 from 2010 to 2018. The combination of the growing importance of injectable drugs, to the phobia caused by needles, the increase in self-administered or at home injections, and the rising cost associated with needle stick injuries, provides the dynamics for the accelerated growth of the needle-free or injection technology marketplace. The global needle-free drug delivery devices market was valued at USD 10.9 billion by 2019, following a 2012-2019 compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.6 . In 2019, insulin delivery for diabetes was observed to be the leading application segment accounting for 31.0 of the total market already then. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the total number of people diagnosed with diabetes was 177 million in 2000 and is expected to reach 300 million by 2025. Thus, the rise in prevalence of diabetes and increasing non-communicable diseases has been and is expected to continue to boost the growth of the needle-free drug delivery devices market globally. North America was observed to be the largest market for needle-free drug delivery devices and accounted for 43.1 of the total market in 2019. The market is mainly driven by high public awareness about novel drug delivery systems, government initiatives for the introduction of needle free drug delivery devices in community vaccination programs and key players domiciled in this region. Asia Pacific was observed to be one of the fastest growing markets with the highest CAGR of 16.3 during the period from 2013 to 2019. The factors attributed to the growth of the market are opportunities available with a wide range of undiscovered applications and untapped countries with high potential in this geography. About us GSG Group Inc. (GSGG) is a shell company currently looking to leverage its managements excellent network globally to initiate business activities in highly profitable geographical and industrial areas. At this point our focus is on establishing and scaling the production of needle free injection devices in locations in Europe and Asia and the sale of such devices first in the Indian and Asian markets, then in the North Americas, to be followed shortly by sales globally thereafter.

The operating expenses comprised general and administrative expenses of 16,076 for the recent period (compared to 11,376 for the year ended December 31, 2021), an increase of 41 . This increase was mainly caused by an increase in professional fees for accounting service due to increased complexity of booking incidents. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 16,076 (year ended December 31, 2021: 11,376), an increase of 41 , caused by increased operating expenses as explained above. Our total assets at December 31, 2022 were 200 (December 31, 2021: 200) which was cash on hand (December 31, 2021: 200). Our total liabilities at December 31, 2022 were 114,301 which comprised of accrued liabilities and other payables of 49,695 and amounts due to related parties of 64,606. The total liabilities at December 31, 2021 were 98,225 which mainly comprised of accrued liabilities and other payables of 33,619 and amounts due to related parties of 64,606.

On December 31, 2022 the Company had authorized 75,000,000 (December 31, 2021: 75,000,000) shares of common stock with a par value of 0.001 per share.

The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern based upon our minimal cash and no source of revenues which are insufficient to cover our operating costs. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There are no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to raise capital, develop a source of revenues, report profitable operations or to continue as a going concern, in which event investors would lose their entire investment in our company. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2022, we had 200 cash on hand and there were outstanding liabilities of 114,301 (cash of 200 and liabilities of 98,225 on December 31, 2021).

This resulted in no changes in cash during the year ended December 31, 2022 (no changes in the last corresponding period of 2021). 9 Table of Contents Our two major shareholders, Decimus Beheer B.V. and Medical Consult Europe B.V. have, through their directors appointed, verbally committed to continue funding operating expenses for the Company in a limited scenario. Notwithstanding this, they have not entered into a legal obligation with the Company for such commitments. There is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We have meaningfully commenced business operations based upon the amount of revenue we have been able to generate. We are in start-up stage operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

There is no guarantee that the Company will begin to generate revenues.

Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on borrowings from related parties to fund operating expenses. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management, under the supervision of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Directors, and Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022 under the criteria set forth in the in Internal Control Integrated Framework . A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has determined that material weaknesses did not exist. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
