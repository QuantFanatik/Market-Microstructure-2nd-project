 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS We are a commercial stage biotechnology acceleration and development company focused on acquiring and in-licensing pre-clinical, clinical-stage and approved life sciences therapeutic products. We aim to acquire, or license and have assembled, a pipeline of multiple therapeutics in development stages ranging from early pre-clinical to commercial ready. Our model seeks to diversify risk by broadening the therapeutic areas we work in as well as providing multiple catalysts as we advance assets through the clinical and regulatory process. We aim to maximize risk-adjusted returns by focusing on multiple assets throughout the discovery and development cycle as well as commercial product revenue generation. We expect to benefit from early positioning in illiquid and/or less well known privately-held assets, thereby enabling us to capitalize on valuation growth as these assets move forward in their development. Currently, we have a portfolio of five therapeutic products, including an FDA approved radiopharmaceutical for metastatic bone cancer pain (Strontium-89 and Metastron TM and three development stage products: QBM-001 for rare pediatric non-verbal autism spectrum disorder, Uttroside-B for liver cancer, and the MANNIN Platform starting with MAN19 for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome caused by infectious diseases like COVID19. The MANNIN platform has several potential therapeutics in development in various indications, including vascular (glaucoma, Cystic kidney disease) and infectious diseases. The infectious diseases the Mannin drug platform may ultimately treat include influenza, COVID-19, Ebola and others. We recently converted our license and joint development agreement with Mannin into an equity stake in Mannin. This is now an asset we believe will grow significantly as they approach milestones and potentially their own IPO in a few years. In 2020, we began generating revenue from our Strontium-89 product for pain palliation in bone metastases. We are exploring a therapeutic expansion post-marketing clinical trials or data aggregation for Strontium-89. We intend to advance our QBM-001 asset to address a non-verbal learning disorder in autistic children and are assessing additional technologies to focus our pipeline in the rare disease space to complement our orphan drug designated liver cancer drug candidate and the rare autism spectrum program. Mannin intends to file investigational new drug applications or equivalent in 2023 with the Canadian regulators for MAN-19 for Acute Respiratory Diseases Syndrome (caused by COVID-19). Additional Mannin indications will also be advanced towards clinical trials for other vascular diseases. Following is a summary of our product pipeline. Our Strategy Our goal is to become a leading biotechnology acceleration and development company with a diversified portfolio of therapeutic products and product candidates. To achieve this goal, we are executing on the following strategy: Strategically collaborate or in- and out-license select programs. 
 We seek to collaborate or in- and out-license certain potentially therapeutic candidate products to biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies for preclinical and clinical development and commercialization. Highly leverage external talent and resources. 
 We plan to maintain and further build our team which is skilled in evaluating technologies for development and product development towards commercialization. By partnering with industry specific experts, we are able to identify undervalued assets that we can fund and assist in enhancing inherent value. We plan to continue to rely on the extensive experience of our management team to execute on our objectives. Evaluate commercialization and monetization strategies on a product-by-product basis in order to maximize the value of our product candidates or future potential products. 
 As we move our drug candidates through development toward regulatory approval, we will evaluate several options for each drug candidate s commercialization or monetization strategy. These options include building our own internal sales force; entering into a joint marketing partnership with another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, whereby we jointly sell and market the product; and out-licensing any product that we develop by ourselves or jointly with another party, whereby 
 4 

Table of Contents 
 another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company sells and markets such product and pays us a royalty on sales. Our decision will be made separately for each product and will be based on a number of factors including capital necessary to execute on each option, size of the market to be addressed and terms of potential offers from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. It is too early for us to know which of these options we will pursue for our drug candidates, assuming their successful development. Acquire commercially or near-commercially ready products and build out the current market for such. 
 In addition to acquiring pre-clinical products, in assembling a diversified portfolio of healthcare assets, we plan on acquiring assets that are either FDA approved or are reasonably expected to be FDA approved within 12 months of our acquiring them. We anticipate hiring a contract sales organization to assume the bulk of the sales and distribution efforts related to any such product. General Information We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 22, 2013. In June 2015, we became a biomedical acceleration and development company focused on licensing, acquiring and providing strategic resources to life sciences and healthcare companies. Our Drug Discovery Approach We aim to acquire, or license and have assembled, a pipeline of multiple therapeutics in development stages ranging from early pre-clinical to commercial ready. Our model seeks to diversify risk by broadening the therapeutic areas we work in as well as providing multiple catalysts as we advance assets through the clinical and regulatory process. Our mission is to: (i) license and acquire pre-commercial innovative life sciences assets in different stages of development and therapeutic areas from academia or small private companies; (ii) license and acquire FDA approved drugs and medical devices with limited current and commercial activity; and (iii) accelerate and advance our assets to the next value inflection point by providing: (A) strategic capital, (B) business development and financial advice and (C) experienced sector specific advisors. Our Research and Development Activities As a biomedical acceleration and development company, research and development is a core aspect of our business. In the fiscal years ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, we incurred approximately 137,000 and 1.1 million, respectively, in research and development activities. Strontium-89 Chloride USP Injection We have been working hard to commercialize Strontium-89 for the non-opiate treatment of metastatic cancer bone pain. In November 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services approved our supplemental abbreviated new drug application for a new drug product manufacturing site, IsoTherapeutics Group, LLC. In 2020, IsoTherapeutics began manufacturing our FDA approved non-opioid cancer bone pain drug Strontium-89 Chloride USP. On February 13, 2020, we launched our FDA approved non-opioid drug Strontium-89 (Strontium Chloride Sr-89 Injection, USP) which has been shown to relieve the persistent pain associated with cancer that has metastasized to bone. In several multicenter, placebo-controlled trials in cancer patients with persistent pain after external beam radiation therapy for bone metastases, pain relief occurred in more patients treated with a single injection of Strontium-89 than in patients treated with an injection of placebo, with a greater percentage of patients experiencing pain scores of zero with no use of rescue opioid analgesics. Median duration of pain palliation has been shown to be 2 to 5 months. Strontium-89 can be re-dosed every 90 days.

 An estimated 10 million people are living with this condition, and due to the opioid crisis, doctors and patients are looking for an alternative to treat metastatic cancer associated bone pain. Given that Strontium-89 can be administered every three months and has proven effective in approximately 80 of the patients who received the drug, Q BioMed is hopeful that a broad market is available and can be accessed with the right resources. Through our US distribution partner, Jubilant Radiopharma TM , we have the capability to reach patients in all 50 states. Our contract manufacturing facility, which is FDA approved to manufacture Strontium-89, is manufacturing commercial-scale quantities on a regular schedule. COVID-19 restrictions on hospital access, people and supply chains slowed our commercial rollout substantially. Any expired and scrapped inventories have been written off. We are fully commercial ready in terms of product availability, infrastructure and distribution and expect to have a meaningful sales revenues 22 once funding is available. We plan to launch the Strontium-89 in global markets, including Europe, as we navigate the regulatory approval process, and we have already seen interest from this region. With the necessary funding, we also plan to undertake further research for Strontium-89 for potential label extension into therapeutic use for survival benefit in metastatic bone cancer through a Phase IV study as well as to explore combination studies for enhancing the value proposition of the drug through better outcomes. We have commercial infrastructure set-up, including medical information and pharmacovigilance, government contracting and marketing plans. We have a distribution partnership with Jubilant Radiopharma who have all the capabilities we require to access the U.S. market, including warehousing/inventory management, invoicing and customer service/ordering. Jubilant also has a sales team that calls on major providers, a national network of nuclear pharmacies in the United States and distribution and coverage throughout the United States. The global demand for access to generic drugs and non-opioid therapies has given Q BioMed access to a global market we continue to be extremely excited about its prospects to re-establish a deserved niche in the late stage cancer treatment landscape. Mannin Research Inc. On October 29, 2015, we entered into a Patent and Technology License and Purchase Option Agreement, as amended in March 2019, with Mannin Research Inc. (Mannin) whereby we were granted a worldwide, exclusive license on, and option to acquire, certain Mannin intellectual property, or IP, within a four-year term. Under the 2019 amendment, the option to acquire was extended to October 29, 2021 and is now expired. On September 1, 2020, we further amended the license agreement allowing Mannin to grant an exclusive license to Mannin GmbH (its wholly owned German subsidiary) in order fully take advantage of the German government grant to Mannin. We have subsequently conversted our rights under the Agreements into a 15 equity stake with a 20M royalty on sales of its products. The Mannin IP and Tie2 platform technology was initially focused on developing a first-in-class eye drop treatment for glaucoma, but was shifted in 2020 to quickly advance a therapeutic for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes the most severe COVID19 infections to require intubation, ICU and poor outcomes. The technology platform may be expanded in scope beyond ophthalmological uses and may include cystic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases and infectious disease. This platform technology has application in many disease states that result in leaky vessels and the inefficient flow of fluids, like COVID-19. The total addressable market for these indications is in excess of 150 billion a year. During the years ended November 30, 20222 and 20211, we respectively incurred approximately 0.12 and 1.1 million of research and development expenses under our license with Mannin. Mannin COVID-19, Glaucoma and Others More Government Funding In March 2021, Mannin Research Inc. was granted an additional CAD 1.7 million from the Canadian governments COVID response budget, adding to the approximate 7.7 million granted in Europe, which together will fund 65-75 percent of every dollar incurred to advance the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome therapy for COVID patients as well as a portfolio of therapeutic assets for vascular diseases currently in development at Mannin, including: glaucoma, cardiovascular diseases, acute kidney disease, and other infectious diseases. The MAN-19 therapeutic is a recombinant fusion protein that treats the patient, instead of targeting the virus. It is not a cure for COVID-19, but it strengthens a patient s blood vessels and protects them against ARDS, breathing problems, sepsis and other infections that may cause the body s organs to begin shutting down. It is designed to keep COVID-19 patients out of the ICU and off a ventilator. Initial manufacturing and preclinical testing has shown promise, and pending upcoming toxicology testing, the drug is poised for clinical 
 6 

Table of Contents 
 trials to start in 2023. If the drug proves both safe and effective, our goal is to have it available for emergency use by patients by early 2024. The next steps are to complete the final toxicology studies, data aggregation and achieve approval of a Phase 1 clinical trial. The market for this kind of treatment in the current pandemic climate is substantial and global. As a result, there is a need to develop more effective treatments. We believe that this technology will play a role in the broader treatment landscape and not only for COVID-19, but also for other infectious diseases that cause ARDS. The Canadian government has named Mannin as one of a handful of companies to qualify for government grant funding under their Strategic Innovation Fund for in country biomanufacturing capabilities and as such Mannin can expect to receive in excess of 150M through this program as it scales up its manufacturing and facility expansion to cater for the Canadian population demand for therapeutics and vaccines. MAN-01 and GDF15 There are over 60 million patients worldwide with primary open-angle glaucoma. MAN-01 aims to reduce the pressure build-up in the eye by assisting with, and correcting, drainage problems in tiny vessels in the eye called the Schlemm s Canal. MAN-01 is being designed to target these unique and extremely important vessels, as over 70 of all fluid in the eye flows through the Schlemm s Canal. Currently, the MAN-01 program is finalizing its preclinical lead candidate optimization by completing a series of ophthalmic in vivo studies to demonstrate efficacy. After successful completion of the in vivo studies, Mannin Research will begin preparing for preclinical toxicology and filing of its IND. Our research shows that the drug s mechanism of action may ameliorate vessel damage in several other diseases such as: kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and against infectious diseases, such as influenza and the current COVID-19 outbreak. We believe these programs comprise a multi-disease platform technology that has several valuable applications. Adding the GDF15 biomarker to our portfolio is a significant step to securing a unique product offering that put precision medicine and patient specific treatment in the hands of clinicians. GDF15 is a companion diagnostic marker to the MAN-01 drug for determining the severity of glaucoma using the expression levels of Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15). Determining the severity of glaucoma using this biomarker will aid in treatment decisions for patients diagnosed with, and being treated for, glaucoma. Recent buyouts in the Biotechnology space has us believing that large pharma companies could be looking for valuable assets like this with multiple downlines because of expiring patient protection on current drugs. Our collaborators at the Washington University in St. Louis are currently examining the effectiveness of GDF15 as a clinical biomarker in a clinical trial. In parallel, Q BioMed and Mannin Research are working with the Biointerfaces Institute at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada to develop a GDF15 biomarker diagnostic kit for monitoring glaucoma severity and progression. The aim is to develop a simple integrated diagnostic test that can be performed at a physician s office with no external, expensive equipment. QBioMed owns the exclusive license to the GDF15 IP from Washington University. The MAN Platform for other indications: Mannin presented positive data on a potential new treatment for acute kidney injury (AKI) at the American Society of Nephrology s annual meeting held on November 7, 2019 in Washington DC. The data presented demonstrates the Ang-Tie2 signaling pathway as a promising therapeutic target for renal protection from acute kidney injury following ischemic reperfusion. Ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury to the kidney occurs in a range of clinically important scenarios including hypotension, sepsis and in surgical procedures such as cardiac bypass surgery and kidney transplantation, leading to AKI. In-hospital mortality for patients with AKI has recently been estimated to be between 20 and 25 and mortality rates in excess of 50 have been reported in critically ill patients with AKI requiring dialysis. For those patients who survive, complications include chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD); cardiovascular events, and reduced quality of life. In the United States, AKI is associated with an increase in hospitalization costs that range from 5.4 to 24.0 billion. No effective treatments have been approved by the FDA. This represents a very significant opportunity to advance a therapeutic in an underserved patient population. ASD-002 On April 21, 2017, we entered into a License Agreement on Patent Know-How Technology with ASDERA whereby we were granted a worldwide, exclusive, license on certain ASDERA intellectual property, which was previously referred to as ASD-002 in our pipeline, and was intended to treat Disruption of Active Language Development (DALD) in toddlers developing Autism Spectrum Disorders. Under that agreement, we paid ASDERA 50,000 and issued 125,000 shares of our Common Stock. On November 27, 2019, we notified ASDERA that we considered the agreement to have been rescinded retroactively as of April 21, 2017. As a result of such rescission, we believe that we have no continuing material obligations to ASDERA. However, we will continue to develop unique technologies for the benefit of underserved patient populations.

 QBM-001 Among the more than 60,000 US children who develop autism spectrum disorders, or ASD, every year, approximately 20,000 become nonverbal and will have to rely on assisted living for the rest of their lives. In parallel to ASD-002, we have been developing a product, QBM-001, intended to treat the rare condition - pediatric minimally verbal autism. Many of the children who miss this potential treatment window between the age of 2 and 5 years old may become non-verbal for the rest of their lives. Currently, there is no treatment for this rare disorder. QBM-001 is not intended to treat other ASDs or to be used beyond the specific group and the estimated treatment window. The treatment window results from independent research that revealed a decreased density in the cortex region of the brain in minimally verbal children with autism, who were 7 years of age. A biomarker study performed by us has directed us to conclude that QBM-001 cannot be used for other autistic groups. The study analyzed over 2000 known autistic markers and found two distinct biomarkers for children with pediatric minimally verbal autism. The biomarkers did not overlap with the high functioning group of autistic children, nor the intermediate group, which struggles with, but develops limited language. The biomarkers gave us insight into what was wrong with the children and has given us unique insight on how to ameliorate their condition with the goal of helping them develop the ability to speak. The biomarker study also led us to evaluate and identify a rat model that contains the biomarkers and is thus a good model to test QBM-001. In addition, we have access to cell lines from deceased children who had pediatric minimally verbal autism. QBM-001 consists of a combination of products that target different mechanisms of action. Having the cell lines and rat model available to us provides us with an excellent preclinical path to validate the safety and efficacy of QBM-001. QBM-001 - Addressing Rare Pediatric Minimally Verbal Autism Causes of non-verbal learning disorder have been linked to several complications that range from a specific mutated gene as with Fragile X Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, Phelan McDermid Syndrome or autoimmunity, where the body s immune system is attacking parts of the brain. Trauma, microbial infections and environmental factors have also been linked to non-verbal learning disorder. Ongoing research is helping to further explain the root cause of why children become non-verbal or minimally verbal. Cognitive intervention is the only form for treatment that has shown to help improve speech capability and social interaction in autistic children, however, with minimal benefit with children with pediatric minimally verbal autism. As intervention does not lead to speech progression, being minimally verbal carries a lifetime burden of over 5 million per person for cost of care. This is further compounded by additional expenses during the lifespan of the person due to loss in productivity in addition to severe emotional strain for the child and the parents. As there are no treatment options for these patients, we believe there is a significant economic opportunity to bring a drug to market in this indication. The active ingredients in our compound are well known and have been approved by worldwide regulators for many years. Using a novel delivery and formulation for the ingredients, we intend to advance this drug through the 505(b)2 pathway. RGCB and OMRF Intellectual Property On June 15, 2017, we entered into a Technology License Agreement with RGCB and OMRF whereby they granted us a worldwide, exclusive, license on intellectual property related to Uttroside-B. Uttroside-B is a chemical compound derived from the plant Solanum nigrum Linn, also known as Black Nightshade or Makoi. We seek to use the Uttroside-B IP to create a chemotherapeutic agent against liver cancer. The initial cost to acquire the exclusive license for Uttroside-B was 10,000. In addition to royalties based upon net sales of the product candidate, if any, we are required to make additional payments upon the following milestones: the completion of certain preclinical studies; the filing of an investigational new drug application with the US Food and Drug Administration or the filing of the equivalent application with an equivalent governmental agency; 
 8 

Table of Contents 
 successful completion of each of Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials; FDA approval of the product candidate; approval by the foreign equivalent of the FDA of the product candidate; achieving certain worldwide net sales; and a change of control of our Company. Subject to the terms of the exclusive license for Uttroside-B, we will be in control of the development and commercialization of the product candidate and are responsible for the costs of such development and commercialization. We are obligated to undertake a good-faith commitment to (i) fund the pre-clinical trials and (ii) to initiate a Phase II clinical trial within six years of the date of the Agreement. Failure to show a good-faith effort to meet those goals would mean that the exclusive license for Uttroside-B would revert to the licensors. UTTROSIDE-B - A Novel Chemotherapeutic for Liver Cancer The liver is the football-sized organ in the upper right area of the belly. Symptoms of liver cancer are uncommon in the early stages. Liver cancer treatments vary, but may include removal of part of the liver, liver transplant, chemotherapy, and in some cases radiation. Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) tends to occur in livers damaged by birth defects, alcohol abuse, or chronic infection with diseases such as hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis (a hereditary disease associated with too much iron in the liver), and cirrhosis. In the United States, the average age at onset of liver cancer is 63 years. Men are more likely to develop liver cancer than women, by a ratio of 2 to 1. There are currently few marketed drugs for the treatment of liver cancer. Sorafinib, a tryosine kinase inhibitor, is the first to market and market leader. Current sales of sorafinib are estimated at 1 billion per year. Uttroside-B appears to affect phosphorylated JNK (pro survival signaling) and capcase activity (apoptosis in liver cancer). It is a natural compound fractionated Saponin derived from the Solarim Nigrum plant. It is a small molecule that showed in early investigation to increase the cytotoxicity of a variety of liver cancer cell types and importantly to be up to ten times more potent than Sorafenib in pre-clinical studies. As it is not feasible to use the plant as the source for a drug, we successfully synthesized the molecule thereby creating an exact replica of the naturally occurring chemical compound. In a joint research program with India-based Chemveda Life Sciences in 2017, we initiated this very complex and challenging synthesis program. After 2 years, the exceptional chemists at Chemveda and our scientists, succeeded. The synthetic molecule has now been tested in comparison to the original plant molecule and the results confirm the same efficacy against the same liver cancer cell lines. We are now optimizing the synthesis of the molecule and are conducting free clinical testing on the initial output from that process and are preparing to advance this into a preclinical program. Due to lack of funding no additional capital has been deployed to this program ring the year ended November 30, 2022. Note on COVID-19 To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has materially affected our Strontium-89 commercializing effort. The Pandemic impacted how patients and physicians interact and our ability to connect with our physician customers and clinic administrators and various government regulators was severely limited and has delayed our entry into the market. Any expired and scrapped inventories have been written off.

 With respect to COVID-19 and Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome, we are working with Mannin on developing a potential treatment. It is in the early stages of development but could prove to be an important tool in treating several infectious diseases that result in respiratory complications. Mannin Research, has received requests from, and submitted responses to, governmental organizations worldwide and philanthropic groups for information about the potential use of its biologic treatment for COVID-19. The potential treatment is based on the understanding that vascular leakage is a key driver of organ injury in diseases such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) caused by viruses, including COVID-19. The Angiopoietin-Tie2 signaling pathway for the treatment of vascular permeability associated with pulmonary edema from respiratory infections like COVID-19, but also ARDS, SARS, seasonal Influenzas and others. There were 45 million symptomatic flu cases, 810,000 hospitalizations and 61,000 deaths in the United States alone during the 2017-2018 flu season, according to the CDC. We are in the late stages of investigations and preclinical evaluation of this potential drug and are collaborating with others on a global basis to advance this program as rapidly as possible. COVID-19 variants continue to evolve and cause concern and demonstrate the need for a non-variant specific treatment. We also believe it could be utilized for seasonal influenzas and future similar pandemic viral threats as a stockpile drug. Patents and Intellectual Property Rights If products we acquire do not have adequate intellectual protection, we will take the necessary steps to protect our proprietary therapeutic product candidate assets and associated technologies that are important to our business consisting of seeking and maintaining domestic and international patents. These may cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that may be commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business. Our competitive position depends on our ability to obtain patents on our technologies and our potential products, to defend our patents, to protect our trade secrets and to operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets of others. We seek licenses from others as appropriate to enhance or maintain our competitive position. We hold a license to all intellectual property related to our licensed the drug candidates. We own the intellectual property four our SR89, our generic Strontium-89 Chloride product candidate for metastatic cancer bone pain therapy, and Metastron TM , our branded Strontium-89 Chloride product candidate for metastatic cancer bone pain therapy. We are not subject to a license for QBM-001, the combination drug candidate related to a nonverbal disorder associated with autism. We have received patents for our liver cancer drug candidate in several jurisdictions including Japan, Canada, Europe and the United States. We have applied for some patents in our own right. Most patents and applications are held in the licensors or inventors names and are assignable under license agreements to us. Competition We operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, will compete with established therapies, as well as new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in the fields in which we research, some in direct competition with us. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. New developments, including the development of other biological and pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace. Developments by competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. We will also face competition from these third parties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates. Raw Materials and Third-Party Manufacturing We began commercially producing our sole product, Strontium-89, in February 2020. To date, we have sourced all the raw material needed for Strontium-89 from Polatom in Poland. Due to the limited production of Strontium-89 to date, we do not consider it a substantial risk that we have only one supplier of this raw material. As we ramp up production, we are in the process of adding a US 
 10 

Table of Contents 
 based supplier of the raw material, and are working through the regulatory approval required to formally add that raw material to our approved ANDA. Likewise, Strontium-89 has been manufactured solely by IsoTherapeutics in Houston, Texas. Although we will continue to rely on them for the manufacture of Strontium-89, we do not currently have any intention of finding an additional manufacturer. Were our relationship with IsoTherapeutics to terminate or they were otherwise unable to manufacture Strontium-89, we would not be able to produce more Strontium-89 until a replacement FDA approved manufacturer is found. Government Regulation The clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable health authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are not permitted to market our product candidates until we receive approval of a Biologics License Application BLA from the FDA. The process of obtaining BLA approval is expensive, often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved. In addition to the significant clinical testing requirements, our ability to obtain marketing approval for these products depends on obtaining the final results of required non-clinical testing, including characterization of the manufactured components of our product candidates and validation of our manufacturing processes. The FDA may determine that our product manufacturing processes, testing procedures or facilities (or those of third parties upon which we rely) are insufficient to justify approval. Approval policies or regulations may change, and the FDA has substantial discretion in the pharmaceutical approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed. The FDA or another regulatory agency can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to: the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials; we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication; the FDA may not accept clinical data from trials which are conducted by individual investigators or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the United States; the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA for approval; we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks; the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials; the FDA may fail to approve our manufacturing processes or facilities or those of third-party manufacturers with which we or our collaborators contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or the approval policies or regulations of the FDA may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval. With respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary among countries and, in addition to the aforementioned risks, can involve additional product testing, administrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, recent events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased cautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new pharmaceuticals based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.

 Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws Federal, state, and international environmental laws may impose certain costs and restrictions on our business. We do not believe that we have spent or lost money due to these laws and regulations. Product Liability and Insurance We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and the eventual sale and use of any product candidates, and claims could be brought against us if use or misuse of one of our product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. While we have and intend to maintain product liability insurance relating to our clinical trials, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us and we may be unable to maintain such insurance. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources or destroy the prospects for commercialization of the product which is the subject of any such claim. We are unable to predict if we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance for any products that may be approved for marketing. Additionally, we have entered into various agreements where we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to our product candidates. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications. We had product liability insurance in place at the time of product launch. Employees As of May 24, 2023, we had seven consultants and management consultants, two of whom we consider full time and five of whom we consider part time. ITEM 1A.

 The issuances of the securities mentioned above qualified for the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. ITEM 6. [RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the Section entitled Risk Factors , and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Overview Q BioMed Inc. (or the Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 22, 2013 and is a commercial stage biomedical acceleration and development company focused on licensing, acquiring and providing strategic resources to life sciences and healthcare companies. We intend to mitigate risk by acquiring multiple assets over time and across a broad spectrum of healthcare related products, companies and sectors. We intend to develop these assets to provide returns via organic growth, revenue production, out-licensing, sale or spin out. Our mission is to solve problems by accelerating the development of important therapies and availability of those therapies to patients. Our intent is to monetize the current pipeline and build a platform for future growth. There are 4 areas of focus:. commercial product revenue growth, partnerships, joint venture equity value and future development platform. Commercial Product We believe that Strontium89 has great potential in the cancer palliation space. As a result of a world in which opioids were a treatment of choice for those patients unlucky enough to be diagnosed with painful metastatic cancers in the bone, we felt that Strontium89 had become a neglected and forgotten drug. We have stayed committed to our belief that Strontium89 was a valuable treatment and have focused on advancing that asset from concept, a neglected drug, to a fully approved, reimbursed commercial product. Since we acquired Strontium89, we have built an infrastructure to commercialize the product, including manufacturing, branding, pharmacovigilance, reporting, federal supply contract, and entering into distribution agreements in the United States and several other countries. Partnership Opportunities UTTROSIDE B - Liver Cancer Chemotherapeutic Along with our developmental partners, we are advancing an innovative treatment for liver cancer, a disease indication that currently has a high unmet need. This molecule was identified in India, traditionally used to treat liver ailments. Subsequent research on that isolated molecule showed promising data, indicating that the molecule was more cytotoxic, killing cancer cells more effectively, in liver cancer cells lines than the current first line liver cancer chemotherapeutic. We have advanced this from a naturally occurring unsustainable plant product to a commercially viable and scalable synthetic drug candidate. This provides an opportunity to partner this asset with a larger oncology focused institution. Currently, there are only two approved first-line liver cancer therapies. We have received Orphan Drug Designation, and we are now preparing to advance this toward clinical partnership. We have been successfully prosecuting our patent portfolio and have received patents or notice of allowance in several countries including Japan, Canada, USA and just recently Europe. We are looking for clinical partnerships to advance this product towards the patients that need it.

 Development Platform - Rare Disease Focus During 2023 we will focus our future development platform on the Rare Disease Space. This focuses our resources on an area in which we already have a presence. Our liver cancer drug candidate, Uttroside B, has already received Orphan Drug Designation. We expect to partner this asset in 2023 and will grow our development platform through in-licensing or acquisition once we have the capital to do so. This rare disease platform will also complement our early-stage treatment for young minimally verbal children on the Autism Spectrum. While our immediate focus is on the above-mentioned assets, we are also developing a new drug candidate to treat young children with pediatric minimally verbal autism. The advancement of this program will depend on the availability of funds and resources as we prioritize our clinical development milestones. There is no effective treatment available to help an estimated 250,000 children born with the condition worldwide each year, 20,000 of them in the United States. We are working on a discovery and development program to address this highly unmet need. Corporate Strategic Goals Our mission is to solve problems by accelerating the development of important therapies and the availability of those therapies to patients. We have been busy building a portfolio that we believe has significant value ranging from blockbuster potential drugs to revenue-producing opportunities. Historical Pipeline Overview Strontium-89 - FDA Approved Drug Launched In January 2021, we announced that treatment with Strontium-89 in the hospital out-patient setting is fully reimbursed by Medicare. In March 2021, we were approved as a federal supplier which allows us to sell into federal hospital systems, notably the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs and the U.S. Department of Defense. We have deployed a VA sales force, and we are preparing to launch an institutional contract sales force to increase our presence and uptake in non-government hospitals Revenue for our fiscal 2021, while still fairly low, is up by over 600 over our fiscal 2020. In January 2021, we received full reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid, were approved as a federal supplier in March 2021, and engaged a federal sales team working mostly with the U.S Departments of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and Indian Health Services. In mid-2020, we began the regulatory registration process for full commercial access in the European Union. These efforts have seen some delay due to Brexit related regulatory requirements. In parallel, we are midway through the registration process in many other countries. Due to some legacy data from previous owners not being available in current reporting standards to complete the filings, we have begun the process of creating our own source documents to complete the filings in non-US jurisdictions. We expect this to be complete in the first half of our fiscal 2022. We have already identified and contracted with a few international distribution partners in anticipation of approval in those countries. We are assessing several potential clinical trial programs that may expand the indication beyond palliation into a therapeutic use that may increase utilization in years to come. Mannin Platform Drugs for ARDS, Glaucoma, Kidney Diseases and others In March 2021, our technology partner Mannin Research Inc. (Mannin) was granted an additional CAD 1.7 million from the Canadian governments COVID response budget, adding to the approximate 7.7 million granted in Europe, which together will fund 65-75 percent of every dollar incurred to advance the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome therapy for COVID patients as well as a portfolio of therapeutic assets for vascular diseases currently in development at Mannin, including: glaucoma, cardiovascular diseases, acute kidney disease, and other infectious diseases. With the uptake of vaccines for COVID-19 growing, the infection numbers are still soaring around the world due to new variants and communities growing apathy and resistance to mandates and social restrictions. Together with Mannin Research Inc., our technology partner, we are pursuing a treatment for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, the condition that causes the most severe symptoms in COVID patients usually resulting in hospitalization and death. The treatment is not dependent on targeting any specific viral variant but 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 rather is virus agnostic, which we believe makes it an invaluable treatment for Corona viruses and other viral diseases like influenza, pneumonia and any future viral pandemic outbreaks. The MAN-19 therapeutic is a recombinant fusion protein that treats the patient, instead of targeting the virus. It is not a cure for COVID-19, but it strengthens a patient s blood vessels and protects them against ARDS, breathing problems, sepsis and other infections that may cause the body s organs to begin shutting down. It is designed to keep COVID-19 or other ARDS patients out of the ICU and off a ventilator. Pending upcoming toxicology testing, we believe that clinical trials for the drug will start in 2023. If the drug proves both safe and effective, our goal is to have it available for use by patients by mid 2024. The market for this kind of treatment in the current and future pandemic climate is substantial and global. COVID-19 is not going away any time soon. As a result, there is a need to develop more effective treatments. We believe that this technology will play a role in the broader treatment landscape and not only for COVID-19, but also for other infectious diseases that cause ARDS. GDF 15 Diagnostic for Glaucoma In Clinical Trial and Product Development and FDA approval anticipated early 2022 In early 2019, we licensed a diagnostic biomarker known as GDF-15 for determining the severity of glaucoma from Washington University in St. Louis. GDF-15 is a perfect companion diagnostic for the MAN-01 and MAN-11 drugs, as well as a novel tool for practicing ophthalmologists and drug developers, because it is designed to assess the efficacy of the treatment or disease progression in their practice. This product represents a unique opportunity, and we believe that current clinical trials are yielding promising results. In partnership with Mannin Research Inc. and McMaster University, we are nearing the completion of development of an in-vitro-diagnostic (IVD) with both point-of-care (detection in a doctor s office) as well as an external laboratory-based detection (i.e. for use in existing CLIA laboratories using existing diagnostic equipment). With appropriate funding, we anticipate completion of the IVD device and submission to the FDA (510K) for in vitro diagnostic approval. UTTROSIDE B - Liver Cancer Chemotherapeutic Along with our developmental partners, we are advancing an innovative treatment for liver cancer, a disease indication that currently has a high unmet need. Currently, there are only two approved first-line therapies. Uttroside-B was discovered in the leaf of the Black Nightshade plant in India. As it is not feasible to use the plant as the source for a drug, we successfully synthesized the molecule thereby creating an exact replica of the naturally occurring chemical compound. We have received several patents for this drug candidate and Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA. QBM-001 - Early Stage Treatment for young minimally verbal children on the Autism Spectrum While our immediate focus is on the above-mentioned assets, we are also developing a new drug candidate to treat young children with pediatric minimally verbal autism. The advancement of this program will depend on the availability of funds and resources as we prioritize our clinical development milestones. There is no effective treatment available to help an estimated 250,000 children born with the condition worldwide each year, 20,000 of them in the United States. We are working on a discovery and development program to address this highly unmet need. We believe we have significant value in our commercial and pipeline assets and we are seeking partnership and the requisite funding in order to fully realize the value therein. Financial Overview Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
 20 

Table of Contents 
 amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated, and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates. Intangible Assets Intangible assets subject to amortization include acquired intellectual property for a marketable product acquired in November 2018. The intellectual property is being amortized over the estimated life remaining at the time of acquisition, which is 10 years. Intangible assets are monitored for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and are also reviewed annually to determine whether any impairment is necessary. Management has assessed the economic life of our Metastron asset to be at least equal to its remaining use life of eight years. As such, management modelled the recoverability test using seven years of estimated future cash flows. Based on this projection, the 350,000 net carrying value of our Metastron asset is fully recoverable and therefore there was no impairment loss as of November 30, 2023 and 2022. Derivative Financial Instruments We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments, including issued stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the Statement of Operations. Depending on the features of the derivative financial instrument, we use either the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or a binomial model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging to determine whether the embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under ASC 815, the instrument is evaluated under ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options for consideration of any beneficial conversion features. Stock Based Compensation Effective December 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2018-07, by which the accounting for share-based payments to non-employees and employees is substantially aligned. Non-employee share-based payment awards are measured at grant-date fair value of the equity instruments that the Company is obligated to issue when the good has been delivered or the service has been rendered and any other conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the instruments have been satisfied. There was no cumulative effect of the adoption of this standard. Share-based compensation cost is recorded for all option grants and awards of non-vested stock based on the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized over the service period required for the award. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the fair value of the awards granted. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which generally represents the vesting period. We calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at grant date.

 Research and Development We expense the cost of research and development as incurred. Research and development expenses comprise costs incurred in funding research and development activities, license fees, and other external costs. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity is performed or when the goods have been received, rather than when payment is made, in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development . Recent accounting pronouncements For a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operation for the years ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 

For the twelve months ended November 30, 2022 November 30, 2021 Net Sales 284,352 195,597 Cost of sales 293,340 246,846 Gross loss (8,988) (51,249) Operating expenses: General and administrative expenses 3,311,249 6,263,475 Research and development expenses 125,378 1,073,841 Total operating expenses 3,436,628 7,337,316 Loss from operations (3,445,616) (7,388,565) Other (income) expenses: Interest expense 1,384,465 506,922 Change in fair value of derivatives (273,782) 304,153 Loss on debt extinguishment 384,311 40,910 Loss on issuance of convertible note 12,809 Settlement of registration liability 241,875 Total other (income) expenses (1,393,523) 851,985 Net loss (2,052,093) (8,240,550) Net Sales During the year ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, we recognized approximately 271,000 and 196,000 of revenue from sales of Strontium89, respectively. This increase was due to more doses being sold during the year ended November 30, 2022, compared to the prior year. Cost of Sales During the year ended November 30, 2022, we recognized approximately 293,000 in cost of sales. These costs were related to raw materials cost, manufacturing cost, distribution cost and write-offs of expired inventory. During the year ended November 30, 2021, we recognized approximately 247,000 in cost of sales. These costs were related to raw materials cost, manufacturing cost and distribution cost. Operating expenses We incur various costs and expenses in the execution of our business. The decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to significantly less stock-based compensation recognized in the year ended November 30, 2022, compared to the 2021 fiscal year. In addition, the common stock price traded relatively higher in 2021 compared to 2022.

 Interest expense The following table summarizes interest expense incurred during the year ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (amounts are rounded to nearest thousand): 

For the Years ended November 30, 2022 November 30, 2021 Interest expense based on the coupon interest rate of the outstanding debt 252,000 96,000 Accretion of debt discount 1,073,000 408,000 Other 60,000 3,000 Total interest expense 1,385,000 507,000 Change in fair value of embedded derivatives We recognized a gain of approximately 274,000 and a loss of approximately 304,000 resulting from the change in fair value of embedded contingent put options in convertible notes during the years ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 respectively. The fluctuation is mainly due to the change in stock price during the reporting periods. Loss on debt extinguishment We recognized a loss of approximately 384,000 and 41,000 due to the conversion of outstanding debentures into shares of common stock during the year ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net loss During the years ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, we incurred net losses of approximately 2.1 million and 8.2 million, respectively. Our management expects to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future, due to our need to continue to establish a broader pipeline of assets, expenditure on R D and to implement other aspects of our business plan. Liquidity and Capital Resources We prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have not yet established a significant ongoing source of revenues and must cover our operating through debt and equity financings to allow us to continue as a going concern. We had approximately 50,000 in cash as of November 30, 2022. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to obtain adequate capital to fund operating losses until we generate adequate cash flows from operations to fund our operating costs and obligations. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease operations. We depend upon our ability, and will continue to attempt, to secure equity and/or debt financing. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Our management determined that there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the consolidated financial statements were issued, and management s concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern within the year following this report persist. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.

Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 910k for the year ended November 30, 2022 as compared to approximately 4.5million for the year ended November 30, 2021. During the year ended November 30, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities relates to proceeds received from the issuance of common stock and debentures, cash advances and proceeds received for warrants modification. During the year ended November 30, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities relates to proceeds received from the issuance of common stock and debentures and is offset by the repayment of notes to related parties. Obligations and Commitments Legal Periodically, we review the status of significant matters, if any exist, and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal claim is considered probable and the amount can be estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation. Advisory Agreements We entered into customary consulting arrangements with various counterparties to provide consulting services, business development and investor relations services, pursuant to which we agreed to issue shares of common stock as services are received. Lease Agreement In December 2016, we entered into a lease agreement for office space located in Cayman Islands for 30,000 per annum. The initial term of the agreement ended in December 2019 and has been further renewed in 2023 for another three years, at a reduced rate of 15000 per year. This agreement does not identify a specific asset and does not convey the use of substantially all of the shared office capacity. As such, this agreement does not contain a lease under ASC 842. We recognize monthly license payments as incurred over the term of the arrangement.

 Rent expense is classified within general and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis and included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows: 

For the year ended November 30, 2022 2021 Rent expense 30,000 30,000 License Agreements Mannin On October 29, 2015, we entered into a Patent and Technology License and Purchase Option Agreement Exclusive License with a vendor whereby we were granted a worldwide, exclusive, license on, and option to, acquire certain intellectual property Mannin IP which initially focused on developing a first-in-class eye drop treatment for glaucoma within the four-year term of the Exclusive License. Pursuant to the exclusive license from Mannin, we may purchase the Mannin IP within six years of entry into the agreement. During the years ended November 30, 2021 and 2020, we respectively incurred approximately 0.8 million and 1.0 million of research and development expenses under our license with Mannin. The purchase option under the license agreement has now expired. On March 26, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the Patent and Technology License and Purchase Option Agreement that it initially entered into with Mannin Research Inc. on October 29, 2015 (the Mannin Agreement ). Under such amendment, the term of the option granted under the Mannin Agreement was extended to October 29, 2021 in exchange for our issuing 100,000 shares to Mannin Research Inc. on April 9, 2019. On September 1, 2020, we further amended the license agreement allowing Mannin to grant an exclusive license to Mannin GmbH (its wholly owned German subsidiary) in order fully take advantage of the German government grant to Mannin. The agreement also confirms our ongoing investment into the Tie2 platform to create, and therefore maintain economic value for us and our shareholders. We have agreed to contribute funds in Mannin GmbH. We paid Mannin 1.5 million in cash payable in three instalments. In addition, we paid to Mannin 0.75 million in shares of our common stock valued as of June 15, 2020, in full satisfaction of R D payables, contracted by Mannin in development of the Tie2 platform. We continue to have the right to 100 of the revenues derived from the Mannin Tie2 technology platform, until such time that Mannin and its subsidiaries have independently raised at least 2 million in funds, expected to happen in 2022, at which time the parties have agreed to a profit share structure reducing our future capital commitments to Mannin R D. During the years ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, we incurred approximately 180,000 million and 0.8 million, respectively, in research and development expenses to fund the costs of development of the eye drop treatment for glaucoma pursuant to the Exclusive License. Washington University On March 9, 2019, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Washington University for license of a diagnostic marker for determining the severity of glaucoma using the expression levels of Growth Differentiation Factor 15. The agreement calls for us to pay an initial fee of approximately 88,000, pay annual maintenance fees ranging from 15,000 to 75,000, make additional payments upon the following milestones: The first commercial sale of a companion diagnostic product; Initiation of a clinical trial for a diagnostic product to support FDA PMA or 510(k) regulatory approval or the foreign equivalent; PMA or 510(k) regulatory approval by the FDA or the foreign equivalent; and The first commercial sale of a diagnostic product. In additional to the above payments, royalty payments based upon sales of a companion diagnostic product or diagnostic product are required.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management is required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports, filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. As required by the SEC Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b), an evaluation is required to be carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described below, including the lack of audited financial statements in this annual report. To address these material weaknesses, management engaged financial consultants, performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements included herein fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting ICFR for the Company. Our internal control system was designed to, in general, provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements, but because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As of November 30, 2020, management has completed a proper evaluation, risk assessment and monitoring of the Company s internal controls over financial reporting based on the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) framework. Management concluded that, during the period covered by this report, that our internal controls and procedures were effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP. Management has identified the following material weaknesses set forth below in our internal control over financial reporting. 1. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible, however segregation of duties has been implemented, with regards to the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions performed by separate individuals. 2. We do not have in-house personnel with sufficient experience with United States generally accepted accounting principles to address complex transactions. These functions have been outsourced. 3. We have determined that oversight over our external financial reporting and internal control over our financial reporting is ineffective as we do not have an audit committee in place. 4. We have not had our independent accountants audit our financial statements for the year ended November 30, 2022 and provide us with a report for such audit. 
 27 

Table of Contents 
 We have begun to take steps to remediate some of the weaknesses described above, including by engaging a financial reporting advisor with expertise in accounting for complex transactions. We have drafted a full set of compliance documents and will be rolling those out in due course. We intend to continue to address these weaknesses as resources permit. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses identified herein, we believe that our consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the years covered thereby in all material respects. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our internal control over financial reporting has not changed during the fourth quarter covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION Not Applicable. PART III ITEM 10.
