FORWARD-LOOKING
INFORMATION 

This
Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. We have
attempted to identify forward-looking statements by using terminology including anticipates, believes, expects, 
 can, continue, could, estimates, intends, may, 
 plans, potential, predict, should or will or the negative of these
terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions; uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels or activity, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking
statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Our expectations are
as of the date this Annual Report is filed, and we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date this
Annual Report is filed to confirm these statements to actual results, unless required by law. 

This
Annual Report also contains estimates and other statistical data made by independent parties and by us relating to market size and growth
and other industry data. This data involves several assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such
estimates. We have not independently verified the statistical and other industry data generated by independent parties and contained
in this Annual Report and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness, though we do generally believe the data to
be reliable. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the industries
in which we operate are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors. Our actual results
could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the
possibility that we may fail to preserve our expertise in medical therapy and product research and development; that existing and potential
partners may opt to work with, or favor the products of, competitors if our competitors offer more favorable products or pricing terms;
that we may be unable to maintain or grow sources of revenue; that we may be unable to attain and maintain profitability; that we may
be unable to attract and retain key personnel; that we may not be able to effectively manage, or to increase, our relationships with
customers; that we may have unexpected increases in costs and expenses; the effect the current COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company
as further discussed herein. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates made
by the independent parties and by us.

Overview 

Creations,
Inc. was incorporated in May 2019. On July 1, 2019, Creations, Inc, acquired a 100 interest in Yetsira Holdings Ltd., though a share
swap agreement. Yetsira Holdings is an Israeli Corporation incorporated on December 2017 which in turn owns 100 of Yetsira Investment
House Yetsira ), our operating entity, incorporated in November 2016, and Ocean Partners Y.O.D.M Ltd. Ocean Partners 
and Ocean ). 

Through
our wholly owned subsidiaries, Yetsira Investment House and Ocean Partners, we operate as a portfolio manager, licensed by the Israel
Securities Authority ISA ). We currently offer and manage ten mutual funds with approximately 283,000,000 in assets, currently
under management AUM ). Our core-business is providing investment services for Israeli mutual funds. 

We
generate revenue primarily from management fees paid by our unitholders, which fees are based upon a certain percentage of their assets
in the funds. Our expenses are mainly comprised of payments of distribution commissions to banks, third-party platform user fees, salary
commissions and expenses, and commissions to the ISA and the Israeli Stock Exchange. Following the acquisition of Ocean, all the investment
management business of the group is managed through Ocean. We exercise effective control over the operations of Ocean pursuant to a series
of contractual arrangements, under which we are entitled to receive substantially all of its economic benefits. 

Our
continued focus is on our core business of mutual fund management, while increasing our number of managed funds, private portfolio and
increasing our AUM. Part of our growth depends on the strength of our brand, which the Company intends to strengthen by increasing our
exposure to the general public, especially through investment advisors in commercial banks, which constitute the main channel for funds
distribution in Israel. We also plan to increase public relations activities and advertising. We also continue to examine the expansion
of our areas of activity, through cooperation, locating synergistic opportunities for our existing areas of activity and establishing
additional parallel investment opportunities. In addition, we may pursue the acquisition of other unrelated businesses in the financial
sector. 

On
August 19, 2020, the Company purchased 7.5 of the outstanding and issued shares of Ocean Partners Y.O.D.M Ltd., an Israeli corporation Ocean that acts as external mutual funds investment management services for 6 mutual funds and several private clients,

The
acquisition implements the Company s vision of becoming a leading investment company in Israel and delivering high quality asset
management and value to its clients and shareholders. By combining the two businesses, Yetsira and Ocean, the Company will be able to
expand its variety of mutual funds and more than double its AUM. Moreover, Ocean has a large base of private clients with a high degree
of customer loyalty which can be used as a platform to enlarge the Company s privet client s portfolio management business.
Furthermore, the acquisition is intended to diversify the experience, skills and abilities of the Company s investment managers
team, including marketing experience that can be used to advance the Company forward.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Management
reviewed currently issued pronouncements during the year ended December 31, 2022, and does not believe that any recently issued, but
not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying condensed financial statements. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. 

We
regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Management s
estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 

Results
of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021. (In Thousands)

the agreement described above, the company classified its investments in Ocean Yetsira Ltd, Yetsira Investment House Ltd. and Ocean Partners
Y.O.D.M Ltd. (the sold companies) as of December 31, 2022, as an assets held for sale valued at 1,378.

the year ended December 31, 2022, our general and administrative expenses were 159 from continuing operations, compared to 23 for the
year ended December 31, 2021, those increase in expenses attributed to dividing mutual expenses of the sold companies and the parent
company, and increase in professional fees such as attorney and CPA to accomplish the sale of the companies.

Net
loss from continuing operations for the years ended on December 31, 2022, and 2021, amount to loss off 220 and 23 respectively,

The
Company realized a net loss of 26 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a net loss of 103 for the year ended December 31,

31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows
for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the Financial Statements ). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 rates applicable to the Company: 

The
enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act in December 2017, reduced the federal income tax rates from an average
of to a flat rate, beginning in the 2018 tax year. The Tax Act also includes a provision designed to currently tax global intangible
low-taxed income GILTI ), beginning in 2018 tax year. As the Company is currently in a loss position, there was no tax
effect in the current year. The Company will record the U.S. income tax effect of future GILTI inclusions in the period in which they
arise, if relevant. 

After
the enactment of the Tax Act, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 SAB 118 which provided guidance on accounting
for the enactment effect of the Tax Act. SAB 118 addressed the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have
the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for
certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provided or a measurement period of up to one year from the Tax Act enactment date
for companies to complete their accounting under ASC 740. During the quarter ended December 31, 2019, the Company completed the accounting
for the income tax effects of the Tax Act, which resulted in an immaterial change in the net deferred tax asset, before valuation allowance,

 Income
 taxes on foreign subsidiaries 

Foreign
subsidiaries are taxed according to the tax laws in their respective country of residence. Neither Israeli income taxes, foreign withholding
taxes nor deferred income taxes were provided in relation to undistributed earnings of the Company s foreign subsidiaries. This
is because the Company has the intent and ability to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in the foreign subsidiaries and therefore those
earnings are continually redeployed in those jurisdictions.

 Deferred
 income taxes 

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets are
as follows: 

Net deferred tax asset before valuation allowance

The net deferred tax liability
at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are included in liabilities held for sale. 

The
Company has a valuation allowance against a majority of its net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realization of the deferred
tax assets due to the operating loss history of the Company. The Company currently provides a valuation allowance against deferred taxes
when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance could
be reduced or eliminated based on future earnings and future estimates of taxable income. 

F. 
 Reconciliation
 of Income Taxes 

The
main reconciling item between the statutory tax rate of the Company and the effective tax rate is the recognition of valuation allowances
in respect to deferred taxes relating to accumulated net operating losses carried forward and temporary differences due to the uncertainty
of the realization of such deferred taxes.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s
rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
or person performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15f of the Exchange Act) that
occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting . 

Limitations
on Internal Controls 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design
of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

Board
Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 

Our
Board of Directors is primarily responsible for overseeing our risk management processes on behalf of our company. The Board of Directors
receives and reviews periodic reports from management, auditors, legal counsel, and others, as considered appropriate regarding our company s
assessment of risks. The Board of Directors focuses on the most significant risks facing our company and our company s general
risk management strategy, and also ensures that risks undertaken by our Company are consistent with the board s appetite for risk.
While the board oversees our company s risk management, management is responsible for day-to-day risk management processes. We

leadership structure supports this approach.

Governance Guidelines

criteria and director qualifications, director responsibilities, board agenda, roles of the chairman of the board and Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, meetings of independent directors, committee responsibilities and assignments, board member access

education, evaluation of senior management and management succession planning. A copy of our corporate governance guidelines will be
