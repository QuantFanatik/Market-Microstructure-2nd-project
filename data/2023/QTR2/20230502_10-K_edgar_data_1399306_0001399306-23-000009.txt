1. BUSINESS 

Company
Overview 

BrewBilt
Brewing is a licensed commercial craft brewer in Northern California. The company began building its first processing brewery in 2021
and started delivering its craft beers in July of 2022. Inspired by European brewing tradition and American craft innovation, BrewBilt
Brewing produces satisfying beers using small-batch California malt for a better-quality beer. Our facility and experienced staff ferment
our lagers in stacked horizontal lagering tanks and give them plenty of cold aging time to achieve optimal taste and clarity. Our packaging
process utilizes a counter-pressure Codi line to ensure the lowest possible level of packaged oxygen, maximizing product stability and
continuity over its shelf-life. 

BrewBilt Brewing is devoted to the modern execution of traditional styles utilizing hand-crafted, industry-leading equipment combined with an artful approach and a passion for quality. A focus on regionally sourced local malt, premium hops, and pristine water gives us a dynamic palette for distinctly satisfying beers. Inspired by European brewing tradition and American craft innovation, we aim to create beers that reflect a sense of place and our shared brewing philosophy for your ultimate drinking pleasure. 
 
 BrewBilt has strong relationships with suppliers of raw materials, equipment, and services globally, in addition an aggressive referral network of satisfied customers nationwide. An Advisory Board consisting of successful business leaders that provide valuable product feedback and business expertise to management. 

Our
Market Opportunity 

The
beer market in the United States grew to 109 billion U.S. dollars in revenue in 2021 after declining in 2019 due to the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The market will not surpass pre-pandemic levels until 2023 and is expected to be valued at 146 billion dollars by
2025. This statistic shows the trend in retail dollar value of craft beer sales in the United States from 2011 to 2021, where retail
sales of craft beer increased in 2021 after 2020 saw a large reduction in sales due to the corona-virus pandemic. Dollar sales of craft
beer amounted to 26.9 billion U.S. dollars in 2021 and the production volume of craft beer in the United States from 2010 to 2021, by
type of brewery. In 2021, regional craft breweries produced approximately 16 million barrels of craft beer, allowing sales volume of
craft beer in the United States to grow by 7.9 percent in 2021. Craft beer production increased from 9.1 million barrels in 2009 to 24.8
million in 2021, and the craft beer volume share of beer production in the United States from 2013 to 2021. In 2021, the craft brewer
volume share of total beer production in the United States amounted to 13.1 percent. 

4 

California had the largest output for the craft beer industry in 2021, offering 10.7 billion in total impact. Pennsylvania finished in second during the year, with a 6.1 billion impact. They were followed by Texas 5.9 billion), New York 5.4 billion), and Florida 4.2 billion). The overall beer market in the United States has a value of 103.5 billion. Although the craft beer segment has a 12.3 share of the total beer volume in the country, it represents 23.6 of the total dollar sales that were achieved in 2021. 

Adults
in the United States consume an average of 19.8 gallons of beer each year, according to the National Beer Wholesalers Association. About
36 of registered breweries in the United States are listed as a brewpub. That means the products they create for consumers are meant
for direct sales that occur on their premises. The average brewery with this classification will produce about 1,000 barrels of beer
each year. 95 of the breweries which are operating in the United States today produced less than 15,000 barrels of beer each year. That
classifies the operation as a microbrewery if 75 or more of the beer the company produces is sold off-site. About 40 of the sales that
occur each year for the craft beer industry happen during the months of June, July, or August. Almost 90 of adults over the age of 21
in the United States live within 10 miles of at least one brewery. Most of these operations qualify as a craft beer producer. There are
more than 950 different craft breweries operating in California right now, making it the largest source of products for the industry
today.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

The
Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is not required to provide
the information under this item. 

ITEM
1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 

None.

ITEM
2. PROPERTIES 

BrewBilt
Brewing operates out of a 6,457 square foot commercial facility located in the Wolf Creek Industrial Building at 110 Spring Hill Dr,
Grass Valley, CA 95945. 

On
August 26, 2022, the company entered into a commercial lease with 4-Corners LLC to establish a Tap Room as part of its brewery revenue.
The space is located at 300 Spring St, Nevada City, NV 95959, and the lease has a term of five years, from September 1, 2022 through
August 31, 2027. 

The
Company currently does not own any real property. 

ITEM
3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The
Company was served a complaint in the County of Nevada, State of California (Case No. CU0000567). BrewBilt Brewing Co. is listed as a
named defendant in this matter. The complaint involves the termination of employee Branford Samuels who was employed as a fabricator
for BrewBilt Manufacturing Inc. and, it is not uncommon for named defendants in a civil matter to be listed, but never served the complaint,
and eventually they are dismissed from the matter without further steps being taken by a plaintiff(s). California Rules of Court
rule 3.110(b) states in relevant part that, [t]he complaint must be served on all named defendants and proofs of service on those
defendants must be filed with the court within 60 days of filing of the complaint. The subject complaint was filed by plaintiff
on February 7, 2023. Therefore, at this time it is speculative whether BrewBilt Brewing Co. has any threat of material litigation or
pending material litigation. To the extent that one considers being a named defendant of a complaint as a threatened or pending
matter, we have not devoted substantial attention to this matter, and do not anticipate doing so in the future with the facts known to
us. Although though the underlying events giving rising to the claim/cause of action occurred prior to the date of December 31, 2022,
at this time, it is our current opinion that there are no unasserted possible claims or assessments of such that are probable as it relates
to BrewBilt Brewing Co. In other words, with facts known to us at this time, we opine that it is not probable (Standard
8(a)) that there are assertable legal claims against BrewBilt Brewing Co. that must be disclosed in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 5 as they do not also likely satisfy Standard 8(b): The amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.

Year
Ended December 31, 2022 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Revenues: 

The
Company s revenues were 124,684 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 43,090 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Revenues in 2022 comprised of 96,750 in beer related sales, 27,650 in audio/visual component sales and 284 in merchandise sales. Of
the 96,750 in beer sales, 1,062 was from related parties. The increase in revenue is from beer sales that started in the third quarter
of 2022. 

Cost
of Sales: 

The
Company s cost of sales was 175,632 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 11,415 for the year ended December 31,
2021. Cost of sales in 2022 included raw materials, beer packaging, selling expenses, depreciation of the brewing equipment and overhead
expenses. The increase is due to the addition of beer sales which have higher costs associated with the production of the product. 

13 

Operating
Expenses : 

Operating
expenses consisted primarily of consulting fees, professional fees, salaries and wages, share based compensation, office expenses and
fees associated with preparing reports and SEC filings relating to being a public company. Operating expenses for the years ended December
31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, were 3,010,128 and 6,930,374, respectively. Although there were increases in salaries and wages in
2022, there was a decrease in share based compensation which was primarily attributable to the decrease in operating expenses. 

Other
Income (Expense) : 

Other
income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was (5,249,903) and 404,811, respectively. Other income
(expense) consisted of derivative valuation gains and losses, gains or losses on settlement and extinguishment of debt, conversion of
debt, and interest expense. The gain or loss on derivative valuation is directly attributable to the change in fair value of the derivative
liability. Interest expense is primarily attributable to interest and penalties on outstanding notes payable, the initial interest expense
associated with the valuation of derivative instruments at issuance, and the accretion of the convertible debentures over their respective
terms. The increase in other expense primarily resulted from the fluctuation of the Company s stock price which impacted the valuation
of the derivative liabilities and an increase in interest expenses. In addition, there was an increase in extinguishment of debt and
interest expenses. 

Net
Loss: 

Net
loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 8,310,979 compared to 6,493,888 for the year ended December
31, 2021. The increase in net loss can be explained by the increase in operating and other expenses during the year ended December 31,
2022. Net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 233,700 compared to 365,104 for the year ended
December 31, 2021. The net loss was higher in 2021 since the reporting period was for one year, whereas the net loss for 2022 is for
a period of six months due to the sale of Satel which occurred on July 1, 2022. 

Impact
of Inflation 

We
believe that the rate of inflation has had a negligible effect on our operations.

The
overall working capital (deficit) increased from (3,836,786) at December 31, 2021 to (5,775,119) at December 31, 2022 due to the reclassing
of 450,000 in related party deposits to fixed assets and an increase of derivative liabilities, accrued liabilities and convertible
debt.

liabilities, amortization of debt discounts, and loss on debt extinguishment.

During
the year ended December 31, 2022 cash (used in) provided for investing activities was (735,679) compared to (559,119) for the year
ended December 31, 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2022, the company recognized brewing equipment of 1,135,801, other property
and equipment of 11,771, reclassified 450,000 of related party deposits, recorded 287,758 of related party accounts payable and incurred
 325,865 in leasehold improvements. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, cash (used in) provided for financing activities was 1,593,466 compared to 1,013,160, for the year
ended December 31, 2021. The increase in cash used by financing activity primarily resulted from an increase in proceeds from notes payable
and promissory notes during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had a cash balance and current asset total of 32,624 and 92,581 respectively, compared with 46,427
and 527,665 of cash and current assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. The decrease in assets was due to the reclassification
of related party deposits for brewery equipment that was delivered and put into use in Q2 2022. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had total current liabilities of 5,867,700 compared with 4,364,451 as of December 31, 2021. The increase
in current liabilities was primarily attributed to an increase in derivative liabilities, accrued liabilities, notes payable and related
party liabilities. 

Going
Concern 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and implement
its business plan. Since its inception, the Company has been funded by related parties through capital investment and borrowing funds. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions
and activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our December 31, 2022 audited financial statements that they
have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. 

Future
Financings 

We
will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional
shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity
securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned acquisitions and exploration activities. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that are material to stockholders. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. 

We
regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these
policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management s estimates are based on historical experience,
on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and
circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 

15 

Significant
Accounting Policies 

Our
discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related
to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, warranty liabilities, share-based payments, income taxes and litigation. We
base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under
the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent
degree of uncertainty. Actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results
and financial position. We believe that the significant accounting policies and assumptions as detailed in Note 1 to the financial statements
contained herein may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of BrewBilt Brewing Company and subsidiaries 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BrewBilt Brewing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of two years
in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December
31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company suffered a net loss from operations and has a net capital deficiency,
which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding those matters are
also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we
are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts
or disclosures to which it relates. 

18 

Convertible
Notes Payable 

As
discussed in Note 8, the Company borrows funds through the use of convertible notes payable that contain conversion prices that fluctuates
with the Company s stock price. Due to the variable nature of the conversion price, the embedded conversion features may require
bifurcation from the host contract. Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining the proper treatment for these convertible
note agreements. 

We
evaluated management s conclusions regarding their convertible notes payable by testing the assumptions used to account for the
conversion features and testing the completeness and accuracy of the convertible note payable amounts.

 have served as the Company s auditor since 2018.

 NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 December
31, 2022 

Management
bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company
may differ materially and adversely from managements estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and
the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. Significant estimates include: 

Liability
 for legal contingencies. 

Useful
 life of assets. 

Deferred
 income taxes and related valuation allowances. 

Impairment
 of finite-lived intangibles. 

Obsolescence
 of inventory 

Stock-based
 compensation calculated using the lattice pricing model. 

and , for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
respectively. 

We
determine revenue recognition through the following steps: 

identification
 of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; 

identification
 of the performance obligations in the contract; 

determination
 of the transaction price; 

allocation
 of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 

recognition
 of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. 

If
the conditions for revenue recognition are not met, the Company defers the revenue and related cost of sales until all conditions are
met. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has deferred revenue of 0 and 0, respectively.

In
management s opinion, the fair value of convertible notes payable and advances payable is approximate to carrying value as the
interest rates and other features of these instruments approximate those obtainable for similar instruments in the current market. Unless
otherwise noted, it is managements opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, exchange or credit risks arising
from these financial instruments. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the balances reported for cash, accounts receivable,
prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, approximate the fair value because of their short maturities. 

since its inception, working capital deficit of , negative cash
flows from operations, and has limited business operations, which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as going concern. The ability of the Company to meet its commitments as they become payable is dependent on the ability of the Company
to obtain necessary financing or achieve a profitable level of operations. There is no assurance the Company will be successful in achieving
these goals. 

The
Company does not have sufficient cash to fund its desired business objectives for its production and marketing for the next 12 months.
The Company has arranged financing and intends to utilize the cash received to fund the production and marketing of more beers. This
financing may be insufficient to fund expenditures or other cash requirements required to complete the product design for the augmented/virtual
reality markets. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in completing any new product development. The Company plans
to seek additional financing if necessary, in private or public equity offering(s) to secure future funding for operations. There can
be no assurance the Company will be successful in raising additional funding. If the Company is not able to secure additional funding,
the implementation of the Company s business plan will be impaired. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will
be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. 

These
financial statements do not give effect to adjustments to the amounts and classification to assets and liabilities that would be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The
Company has elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components as a single component. The lease expense
is recognized over the expected term on a straight-line basis. Operating leases are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets,
current operating lease liabilities and non-current operating lease liabilities. 

The
new standard also provides practical expedients and certain exemptions for an entity s ongoing accounting. We have elected the
short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. This means, for those leases where the initial lease term is one
year or less or for which the ROU asset at inception is deemed immaterial, we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities. Those

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

This
report includes the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by Rule 13a-14 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2. This Item 9A includes information concerning the controls
and control evaluations referred to in those certifications. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December
31, 2022. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal
controls over financial reporting, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.
Management anticipates that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective until the material weaknesses are remediated.
Our company intends to remediate the material weaknesses as set out below. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

58 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022,
using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2022, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

1. 
 
 There
 is a lack of accounting resources The Company has insufficient resources for data entry, reviews, and/or oversight from
 a financial expert with the appropriate level of knowledge and experience to accurately capture transactions in accordance with US
 GAAP and SEC rules and regulations. This lack of resources further results in inadequate segregation of duties. Additionally,
 the Company lacks an audit committee as well as a financial expert. 

2. 
 
 The
 Company lacks processes and procedures to ensure transactional evidence is properly retained - The Company needs to
 implement processes that ensure they are aware of, and maintain, evidence necessary to substantiate recorded transactions. The
 Company needs to retain formal executed documents and adequate support, as they are essential to accurate financial reporting. 

3. Due
to the Company not having formal Control procedures related to the approval of related party transactions. 

Accordingly,
the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 

As
a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by COSO. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

means a person other than an Executive Officer or employee of the Company or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the
opinion of the Company s Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director. According to the NASDAQ definition, we have no independent directors.
