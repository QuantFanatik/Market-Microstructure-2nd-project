MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Due to the limited level of operations, the Company has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption that the Company is a going concern. The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts of revenue, expenses, income, assets and liabilities, reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which our management uses judgment, assumptions and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as appropriate based on changing conditions. 5 | Page Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATION As of February 28, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of 32,907. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. Year ended February 28, 2023 compared to the Year ended February 28, 2022 Revenue During the year ended February 28, 2023 the Company did not generate any revenue compared to 10,300 for the year ended February 28, 2022. The revenue decreased due to lack of orders from customers. Operating Expenses During the year ended February 28, 2023, we incurred total expenses and professional fees of 20,890 compared to 18,961 for the year ended February 28, 2022. General and administrative and professional fee expenses incurred generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, such as legal and accounting. Net Loss Our net loss for the year ended February 28, 2023 was 20,890 compared to 8,661 for the year ended February 28, 2022. The change in net loss was due to increase in operational expenses in conjunction with the decrease in revenue during 2023. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As at February 28, 2023 our total assets were 13,505 compared to 32,520 in total assets at February 28, 2022. As at February 28, 2023, our current liabilities were 13,112 compared to 11,237 as of February 28, 2022. Stockholders equity was 393 as of February 28, 2023 compared to 21,283 as of February 28, 2022. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended February 28, 2023, net cash flows used in operating activities was 18,384, consisting of net loss of 20,890, depreciation expense of 2,306 and a increase in accounts payable of 200. For the year ended February 28, 2022, net cash flows used in operating activities was 9,700 consisting of net loss of 8,661, depreciation expense of 1,461 and an decrease in accounts payable of 2,500. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities during the year ended February 28, 2023 was -0-. Cash flows used in investing activities during the year ended February 28, 2022 were 6,920. During the year ended February 28, 2022, the Company purchased fixed assets. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended February 28, 2023 were 1,674, consisting of advances from a related party of 1,674 compared to 43,681 for the year ended February 28, 2022, consisting of advances from a related party of 10,381 and proceeds from issuance of common shares of 33,300. 6 | Page Table of Contents PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. MATERIAL COMMITMENTS As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments. PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Cyber App Solutions Corp. (the Company) as of February 28, 2023 and 2022 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholder s deficit and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended February 28, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of February 28, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, the Company has incurred net losses and has minimal revenues. These factors, and the need for additional financing in order for the Company to meet its business plans raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021. PCAOB Firm ID# May 31, 2023 3001 N.

F-5 Table of Contents CYBER APP SOLUTIONS CORP. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2023 AND 2022 . These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

F-8 Table of Contents for the periods ended February 28, 2023 and 2022 is as follows: Change in valuation allowance - - The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the net deferred tax assets at February 28, 2023 and 2022 are as follows: Valuation allowance - - The Company has of net operating losses NOL carried forward to offset taxable income, if any, in future years. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of February 28, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.
