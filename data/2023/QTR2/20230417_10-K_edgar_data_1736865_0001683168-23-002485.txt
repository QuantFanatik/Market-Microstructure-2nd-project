Going Concern 

The financial statements for the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021 have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge
its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company anticipates future losses in the development
of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining the necessary financing
to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance
operating costs over the next twelve months with loans or contributions from related parties and, or, the sale of common stock. There
is no assurance that this series of events will be satisfactorily completed. 

Financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Unrecognized Tax Benefits 

The Company uses the liability method, where deferred
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes. The Company has incurred net losses in past years and,
therefore, has no tax liability. 

The Company reported no uncertain tax liability
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and expects no significant change to the uncertain tax liability over the next twelve months. 

7 

Stock Based Compensation 

The Company applies Topic 718 Share-Based
Payments Topic 718 to share-based compensation, which requires the measurement of the cost of services received
in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost is recognized when
the event occurs. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of options granted. 

The Company accounts for equity-based transactions
with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees Topic No.
505-50 ). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value
of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers. The Company currently has no active revenue streams 

Revenue is recognized when control of the services
is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the
services. 

Revenue is recognized based on the following five step model: 

- Identification
of the contract with a customer 

 - Identification
of the performance obligations in the contract 

 - Determination
of the transaction price 

 - Allocation
of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

 - Recognition
of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation 

Performance Obligations 

For contracts with multiple performance obligations,
the Company allocates the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone
selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. The Company uses an observable price to determine
the stand-alone selling price for separate performance obligations or a cost plus margin approach when one is not available. Historically
the Company s contracts have not had multiple performance obligations. Revenue related to the sales of products are recognized at
the point in time at which control transfers to the buyer. 

Sales, value add, and other taxes collected concurrent
with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized
as expense. Payment terms between invoicing and when payment is due is less than one year. As of December 31, 2022, none of the Company s
contracts contained a significant financing component. 

The Company elected the practical expedient to
not adjust the amount of revenue to be recognized under a contract with an end user for the effects of time value of money when the timing
difference between receipt of payment and recognition of revenue is less than one year. 

8 

Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining
Performance Obligations 

At the end of each reporting period, the Company
performs a calculation to determine the portion of that period for which goods or services have not yet been provided. From time to time,
the Company may receive payment for sales of its products from a customer before the goods have shipped. This amount is considered a contract
liability and is recorded as deferred revenue. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had no revenue expected to be recognized
in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at the end of the reporting period. 

Contract Costs 

Costs incurred to obtain a customer contract are
not material to the Company. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient to not capitalize contract costs to obtain contracts
with a duration of one year or less, which are expensed and included within cost of goods and services. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Estimates are used to determine the amount of
variable consideration in contracts, the standalone selling price among separate performance obligations and the measure of progress for
contracts where revenue is recognized over time. The Company reviews and updates these estimates regularly. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

As defined in ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements, 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use
in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These
inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on
the observability of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation methodologies
into the following three levels: 

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical
assets or liabilities in active markets. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and must
be used to measure fair value whenever available. 

Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other
than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or
other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs which
reflect a reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use for pricing an asset or liability.
For example, level 3 inputs would relate to forecasts of future earnings and cash flows used in a discounted future cash flows method. 

9 

The following table summarizes fair value measurements
by level at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

market values as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to the intended short-term maturities of these financial instruments. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

In preparing the financial statements, management
considered all new pronouncements through the date of the report. 

The Company does not believe that any recently
issued effective pronouncements, or pronouncements issued but not yet effective, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying
financial statements.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, 
as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing
disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

In connection with the preparation of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, our sole executive officer (who serves as both principal executive officer and
principal financial officer) has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(c) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

The management of the Company is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting ICFR for the Company. Our internal control
system was designed to, in general, provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board regarding the preparation
and fair presentation of published financial statements, but because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of the
Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The framework used by management in making that assessment
was the criteria set forth in the document entitled 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, management concluded that, during the period covered
by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022 and that material weaknesses in ICFR
existed as more fully described below. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB Auditing Standard AS 2201, in internal
control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the material weaknesses
described below which have caused management to conclude that as of December 31, 2021 our internal controls over financial reporting were
not effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

11 

Due to our size and nature, segregation of all
conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of
transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions are being performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated
the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties in all of our financially significant processes and have concluded that this control
deficiency represented a material weakness. 

Notwithstanding the assessment that our ICFR was
not effective and that there are material weaknesses as identified herein, we believe that our consolidated financial statements contained
in this Annual Report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the years covered thereby in all
material respects. 

This Annual Report does not include an attestation
report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s
report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm as we are a smaller reporting company and
are not required to provide the report. 

Changes in Internal Controls 

During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022,
there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to
materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting

Disclosure of Commission Position on Indemnification
of Securities Act Liabilities 

Our directors and officers are indemnified as
provided by the Nevada corporate law and our bylaws. We have agreed to indemnify each of our directors and certain officers against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions described above, or otherwise, we have
been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore,
unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than our payment of expenses incurred or
paid by our director, officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director,
officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter
has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by
it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 

We have been advised that in the opinion of the

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To: 
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

Golden Developing Solutions, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Golden Developing Solutions, Inc., and its subsidiaries (collectively the Company as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years
in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December
31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31,
2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Emphasis of Matter 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company had
incurred substantial losses during the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of December 31, 2021, the Company had a working capital deficit.
These factors gave rise to substantial doubt that the Company would continue as a going concern. During the year ended December 31, 2022,
the Company continued to incur substantial losses, and as of December 31, 2022, the Company still had a working capital deficit; accordingly,
the substantial doubt of the Company s ability to continue as a going concern that existed as of December 31, 2021 was not alleviated
and is still outstanding at December 31, 2022 and up through the date of this report. Management s plans to address this substantial
doubt is set forth in Note 2. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainly. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Revenue is recognized based on the following five
step model: 

- 
 Identification of the contract with a customer 

- 
 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract 

- 
 Determination of the transaction price 

- 
 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

- 
 Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation 

Performance Obligations 

For contracts with multiple performance obligations,
the Company allocates the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone
selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. The Company uses an observable price to determine
the stand-alone selling price for separate performance obligations or a cost plus margin approach when one is not available. Historically
the Company s contracts have not had multiple performance obligations. For subscription revenue, the Company s performance
obligations are recognized over a time period equal to the length of the subscription period, which is generally 30 days. Revenue related
to the sales of products are recognized at the point in time at which control transfers to the buyer. 

Sales, value add, and other taxes collected concurrent
with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized
as expense. Payment terms between invoicing and when payment is due is less than one year. As of December 31, 2022, none of the Company s
contracts contained a significant financing component. 

The Company elected the practical expedient to
not adjust the amount of revenue to be recognized under a contract with an end user for the effects of time value of money when the timing
difference between receipt of payment and recognition of revenue is less than one year. 

Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining
Performance Obligations 

At the end of each reporting period, the Company
performs a calculation to determine the portion of that period for which goods or services have not yet been provided. From time to time,
the Company may receive payment for sales of its products from a customer before the goods have shipped. This amount is considered a contract
liability and is recorded as deferred revenue. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had revenue expected to be recognized
in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at the end of the reporting period. 

Contract Costs 

Costs incurred to obtain a customer contract are
not material to the Company. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient to not capitalize contract costs to obtain contracts
with a duration of one year or less, which are expensed and included within cost of goods and services. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Estimates are used to determine the amount of
variable consideration in contracts, the standalone selling price among separate performance obligations and the measure of progress for
contracts where revenue is recognized over time. The Company reviews and updates these estimates regularly. 

and in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

and of consulting fees to a company controlled by a Director of the Company. 

cash on hand and no revenue to meets its ongoing operating expenses, and liabilities of all of which are due within 12 months. 

The financial statements for the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021 have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge
its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company anticipates future losses in the development
of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining the necessary financing
to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance
operating costs over the next twelve months with loans or contributions from related parties and, or, the sale of common stock. There
is no assurance that this series of events will be satisfactorily completed. 

Financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern.
