Item
1. Business. 

In
this annual report we refer to US Lighting Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries as USLG, the company, we and our, unless the context requires
otherwise. 

Overview 

US
Lighting Group, Inc. is a parent company comprised of four subsidiaries Cortes Campers, LLC, a brand of high-end molded fiberglass
campers, Futuro Houses, LLC, focused on design and sales of molded fiberglass homes, Fusion X Marine, LLC, a high-performance boat designer,
and MIGMarine Corporation, a composite manufacturing company that produces proprietary molded fiberglass products for our other business
lines. 

We
derive expertise and inspiration from the marine industry, where the harshest conditions are expected and must be met with superior engineering
and the latest in composite technology. We apply these standards to the products we manufacture and supply to the recreational vehicle
(RV) market and, more recently, to the housing segment. 

Molded
fiberglass products are exceptionally strong, lightweight and durable. Composite materials are corrosion resistant and provide efficient
insulation, making them attractive for both outdoor enthusiasts and residential housing needs. Molded construction also allows for creation
of irregular, unusual or circular objects, which permits the innovative shapes and features of our products. 

Our
vision is to promote innovation and challenge manufacturing practices in the industries that rely on labor-intensive, outdated and wasteful
processes, while providing consumers with superior products designed to last for generations. 

Our
headquarters are located at 1148 East 222nd Street, Euclid, Ohio, 44117. Our main website is www.USLightingGroup.com. 

Corporate
History 

The
company was originally incorporated in the State of Florida on October 17, 2003, under the name Luxurious Travel Corp., in order to develop,
market and distribute a hotel booking engine software. We acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of US Lighting Group,
Inc. (founded in 2013) on July 13, 2016, and changed our corporate name to US Lighting Group, Inc. on August 9, 2016. At the time the
company designed and manufactured commercial LED lighting, both for retrofits and new construction. Applications included commercial
spaces such as board rooms, offices, factories, stores, gymnasiums, schools, hospitals, warehouses, and greenhouses, as well as some
residential applications such as garages. Distribution channels included Home Depot and a chain of regional dealers. 

On
December 1, 2016, we acquired Intellitronix Corp., an automotive electronics manufacturer, serving a niche market of aftermarket electronics
for customer installations as well as several emerging original equipment manufacturer (OEM) applications. At the time of acquisition,
Intellitronix already had access to the automotive electronics market and had an established distributor and consumer base. 

Through
supplying OEMS with electronic components, USLG was introduced to the RV industry. Management identified a fast growing and underserved
niche of small, tow-behind fully molded fiberglass travel trailers. We started developing a new business plan to create a luxury 17-foot
travel camper to appeal to young professionals working remotely as well as retirees and other consumers intrigued by the travelling lifestyle. 

On
January 11, 2021, the Company formed Cortes Campers, LLC Cortes Campers ), a wholly owned subsidiary, to operate its new
brand of innovative travel trailers. The Company developed the product, created a dealer network and started supplying campers in the
second part of 2022. Financial results for the year ending December 31, 2022 reflect revenue of 1,083,114 generated by Cortes Campers. 

On
April 12, 2021, we formed Fusion X Marine, LLC, a Wyoming company, for the purposes of design, development and distribution of high-performance
speed boats. As of the date of December 31, 2022, this division had not generated revenue. 

On
May 14, 2021, we sold selected assets of Intellitronix to Ohio INTX Cooperative, a Northeast Ohio based non-profit organization, to focus
on pursuing our new business direction in the RV industry. 

On
August 5, 2022, we acquired MIGMarine Corporation Mig Marine ), a fiberglass manufacturing company founded in 2003. With
the acquisition of Mig Marine, we were able to streamline our manufacturing processes, improve production cycles and scale to meet the
demand of Cortes Campers generated order back-log. 

1 

On
January 12, 2022, we formed Futuro Houses, LLC, a Wyoming company, to design, market and distribute molded fiberglass homes. Throughout
2022, Futuro Houses engaged in engineering and development of our first UFO themed home model inspired by the original
Futuro house designed by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen. As of December 31, 2022 , the division had not generated revenue. 

We
plan to expand our manufacturing footprint, enhance production techniques, and develop more products in the RV, marine, and composite
housing sectors. Current R D efforts are directed towards future tow-behind camper models under Cortes Campers brand as well as prefabricated
housing segment. 

As
of December 31, 2022, our revenue was driven by shipments of fiberglass campers marketed under Cortes Campers brand.

Industry
Facts 

According
to Recreational Vehicle Industry Association research, the RV industry has demonstrated growth over the last several years with an unprecedented
surge in 2021. Results for the RV Industry Association s December 2022 survey of manufacturers determined the total shipments for
2022 ended with 493,268 shipments, the third best year on record. 1 

Reasons
for growth are attributed to a general increase in popularity, rising household incomes and new demographics entering the market. The
Covid-19 pandemic further fueled interest in RV recreation as more people were able to work remotely. RV trips also became a preferred
mode of tourism for many Americans as the pandemic wreaked havoc on the traditional travel. 

A
recent survey has found that 37 of American leisure travelers, representing 67 million, plan on taking an RV trip this year. Among leisure
travelers, who are defined as any U.S. resident who has taken some type of leisure trip in the past year, the top reasons for RV travel
are exploring the outdoors and having additional flexibility through remote work or school. While spending time outdoors has consistently
remained a top reason for RVing, the number of respondents who cited flexibility in work have increased by 12 in the past year. 

The
survey also showed that finances are a driving reason for people s plans to take an upcoming RV trip. On average, RV vacations
cost 50 less than comparable hotel and plane ride trips and a third less than hotel and car ride trips, making RVing an attractive option
for people looking for the freedom to travel while also controlling their travel expenses. 

The
most popular RV trip destinations include state and national parks, with the latter remaining the most popular destination among all
age groups. 

However,
the highest interest in RVing overall comes from the younger age groups. Surveys indicate that 49 of Generation Z and 48 of Millennials
plan to take an RV trip in the next year. Their purchase intent is also higher, with 41 of Generation Z and 35 of Millennials planning
to buy an RV in the next year. 

Among
RVers, which is defined as people who have taken a trip in an RV they rent, own, or borrow in the past 12 months, 50 plan to buy an
RV in the next year. This is up 14 from last year. 1 

According
to a Facts Factors research report, the global RV Market was estimated at USD 51 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach USD 77
billion by 2026. 2 

The
increased demand for RV units also fuels innovation as manufacturers are looking to satisfy the needs of a new, younger demographic,
most of whom are first time buyers. 

Cortes
Campers saw these market trends as an opportunity to introduce lightweight, towable, composite-built campers that feature luxury amenities
in a small footprint.

Principal
Products 

Traditional
RVs are built using wooden structures and corrugated aluminum shells, also referred to in the industry as sticks and tin 
construction, or with aluminum skeleton and fiberglass wall panels also known as laminated RVs. While these methods dominate
the manufacturing landscape of the industry, traditional RVs are known for frequent structural damage, mold and rot, fast deterioration,
and lack the ability to perform in harsher, colder environments. Additionally, both manufacturing techniques require highly skilled manual
labor in such fields as carpentry, wood-working and interior finish. 

Molded
composite manufacturing, including fiberglass, has been the primary construction process for many high-tech industries such as aerospace,
the wind power industry and marine. Composite materials offer unparalleled structural integrity, while being lightweight and resistant
to the elements. Molded construction relies on a master mold, which consistently yields production units with minimal variances. 

Cortes
Campers first product is the Cortes 17, a 17-foot long single axle tow-behind molded fiberglass camper. The innovative design
challenges construction techniques currently used by the RV industry. Drawing from expertise in the marine industry, our unique no-wood 
construction replaces all wood with composite alternatives or corrosion resistant materials, producing a truly durable camper designed
to last a lifetime. Other innovations include axle-less independent suspension, corrosion resistant chassis, and four-season insulation. 

Amenities
include a gas oven, and three-burner cooktop, microwave oven, 8.0 cubic-foot refrigerator, kitchen workstation, bathroom and shower,
air conditioner, LED television as well as ample storage and many large windows. The camper sleeps two and is rated at 3,500 pounds maximum
towable weight. These amenities are not typically available in competitor campers of this size. 

Futuro
Houses 

The
original Futuro house was a prefabricated home designed by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen, of which fewer than 100 were built during
the late 1960s and early 1970s. The shape, reminiscent of a flying saucer, and the structure s airplane hatch entrance, has made
the houses sought after by collectors and by Airbnb renters. The Futuro was composed of fiberglass-reinforced polyester plastic, polyester-polyurethane,
and polymethyl methacrylate, measuring 4 meters (13 feet) high and 8 meters (26 feet) in diameter. 

Modular
construction, structural integrity and energy efficiency of the Futuro houses gained a new relevance in the recent years as a quest for
off-grid, rugged, prefabricated homes entered mainstream. We have developed tooling and master molds to create a similar full-scale structure
but incorporating updated materials and keeping modern building codes in mind. We are developing a distribution model and will make these
structures available for sale through a network of exclusive distributors. The company currently does not own the newly engineered patterns
for the design, but has exclusive access to them and has plans to acquire the patterns in the future. 

3 

Manufacturing
Process 

The
manufacturing of molded fiberglass products involves constant cycling of master molds that require curing time before the finished parts
can be pulled out. Currently Cortes campers are built out of a single mold for each body component, however, more molds can be created
to increase the number of campers that can be produced. Each mold can be cycled once a day. 

The
fabrication schedule includes processes such as gel coat spray application, fiberglass lamination, reinforcement, curing time, cutting
and final assembly. 

Manufacturing
is performed in-house in the 26,000 square-foot industrial facility located just outside of Cleveland, Ohio. 

Distribution
and Current Market 

Cortes
Campers has established a network of professional RV dealerships to market and distribute its products. Throughout 2022, Cortes Campers
added several multi-location dealers who represent the brand and serve markets in Florida, Texas, California, New England, Tennessee
and others. Cortes Campers also has an established dealer in Canada. We continue efforts to develop distribution partners in North America
and beyond. As of March 2023, Cortes Campers are available through 26 dealer locations in US and Canada. A full list of our current dealers
can be viewed on our Cortes Campers website at www.CortesCampers.com. 

In
2022, we secured several floor planning arrangements for banks to finance dealer purchases through their floor planning programs. This
has allowed Cortes Campers to attract additional dealer interest and made inventory purchases more attractive for dealers. 

Patents

Suppliers
 International and Domestic 

Raw
materials utilized in composite manufacturing include fiberglass, gelcoats and resins. Materials used in final assembly are custom fabricated
chassis, water tanks, wheels and tires, appliances, electrical, plumbing and other interior components. Currently Cortes Campers 
specifications call for materials that can be sourced domestically from United States or Canadian based manufacturers and suppliers.
However, many of those components have origins in Asia, and recent supply chain disruptions, driven by the Covid-19 pandemic as well
as increased demand for recreational vehicle components, might dramatically alter the supplier base of the company and its vendors. 

4 

Competition 

Cortes
Campers directly competes with several molded fiberglass camper manufacturers such as Casita, Oliver Travel Trailers, and Scamp. Another
notable competitor is Airstream. Indirect competition includes traditionally built tow-behind campers in the same length from large established
RV manufacturers such as Thor, Forest River and Jayco. 

Seasonality 

Historically,
because RVs are used primarily by vacationers and campers, RV sales tend to be seasonal, with lower sales during the winter months than
in other periods. However, industry wholesale shipments did not follow these typical historical seasonal patterns post Covid-19, as manufacturers
and dealers responded to the high consumer demand for RVs. We have experienced continuous sales growth the last few quarters after the
release of our Cortes Campers line. However, we currently expect that our RV sales may vary based on historical seasonal patterns in
the future. 

Product
Safety and Environment Regulation 

In
the countries where our products are sold, we are subject to various vehicle safety and compliance standards. Within the United States,
we are a member of the RVIA, a voluntary association of recreational vehicle manufacturers which promulgates recreational vehicle safety
standards in the U.S. We place a RVIA seal on each of our North American recreational vehicles to certify that the RVIA s standards
have been met. We also comply with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA in the U.S. and with similar
standards in Canada relating to the safety of our products. 

Carious
environmental regulations relating to air, water and noise pollution affect our business and operations. For example, these standards,
which are generally applicable to all companies, control our choice of paints, our air compressor discharge, the handling of our waste
water and the noise emitted by our facility. We believe that our products and plant comply in all material respects with applicable vehicle
safety (including those promulgated by NHTSA), environmental, industry, health, safety and other required regulations. 

We
do not believe that ongoing compliance with existing regulations will have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, future developments could impose additional costs on our business operations. 

Human
Capital 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had 28 full-time employees and one part time employee. We rely on a skilled workforce, particularly fiberglass
laminators, to manufacture our products. We believe that we offer competitive compensation packages and that we have good working relationships
with our employees. Our employees are not members of a union. 

5 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

Risks
Related to our Business and Operations 

We
have incurred substantial losses and only recently began generating significant revenue. 

We
incurred losses as we developed our Cortes Camper products and repositioned the company as an innovative composite technology provider.
Although we have begun generating revenue, if we are not successful in expanding our sales network and controlling costs, among many
other factors, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability as planned. 

We
may need to raise substantial funds for operations and to fund expansion. 

We
may need substantial additional funding, on an ongoing basis, in order to continue execution of our business plan, to develop new products
and increase production of existing products, to develop and optimize our manufacturing and distribution arrangements, and for other
corporate purposes. Any financing, if available, may include restrictive covenants and provisions that could limit our ability to take
certain actions, preference provisions for the investors, and/or discounts, warrants, conversion rights, anti-dilution rights, the provision
of collateral, or other incentives. Any financing will involve issuance of equity and/or debt, and these issuances will be dilutive to
existing shareholders. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any financing or that the terms will be acceptable.
If we are unable to obtain additional funds on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we may be required to curtail our plans. 

Our
sales may be negatively impacted by numerous macroeconomic events. 

Sales
of recreational vehicles could decline for many reasons outside our control, such as a financial crisis, recession, inflation, higher
interest rates, higher fuel costs, or significant geopolitical event. In times of economic uncertainty, consumers may have less discretionary
income and may defer spending on high-cost, discretionary products such as RVs which may in turn adversely affect our financial performance.
Although the RV industry has experienced increased sales and operating results as a result of the unique consumer demand for recreational
vehicles since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for RVs could decrease amid high inflation and rising interest rates. 

Our
business is affected by the availability and terms of financing to independent dealers and retail purchasers. 

Generally,
independent recreational vehicle dealers finance their purchases of inventory with financing provided by lending institutions. A decrease
in the availability of this type of wholesale financing, more restrictive lending practices or an increase in the cost of such wholesale
financing could limit or prevent independent dealers from carrying adequate levels of inventory, which may limit product offerings and
could lead to reduced demand for our products. Further, a decrease in availability of consumer credit resulting from unfavorable economic
conditions, or an increase in the cost of consumer credit, may cause consumers to reduce discretionary spending which could, in turn,
reduce demand for our products and negatively affect our sales and profitability.

Risks
Related to Our Company and Stock 

You
may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock for general
corporate purposes. 

In
the future, we may issue additional equity securities for capital raising purposes, in connection with hiring or retaining employees,
to fund acquisitions, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any additional shares of common stock will dilute our current
shareholders and may create downward pressure on the value of our shares. 

Our
former CEO currently has the ability to determine the election of our directors and the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders. 

As
of March 31, 2023, our former chief executive officer Paul Spivak owns 49.9 of our outstanding shares of common stock and his wife,
Olga Smirnova, owns 1.0 of our outstanding shares. As a result, together they control a majority of our stock and have the ability to
determine the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders, including the election of directors. As a consequence, it may be
difficult for the other shareholders to remove our board members. Mr. Spivak s voting control could also deter unsolicited
takeovers, including transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market
prices. 

Our
auditors have issued a going concern audit opinion. 

Management
has determined and our independent auditors have indicated in their report on our December 31, 2022 financial statements that there is
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. A going concern opinion indicates that the financial
statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible
future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if
we do not continue as a going concern. Therefore, you should not rely on our consolidated balance sheet as an indication of the amount
of proceeds that would be available to satisfy claims of creditors, and potentially be available for distribution to shareholders, in
the event of liquidation. 

Our
management and our independent auditors previously identified certain internal control deficiencies which, while now considered remediated,
had been considered by our management and our independent auditor as material weaknesses. 

In
connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, our management and our independent
auditor identified internal control deficiencies that, in the aggregate, represent material weaknesses, as described more fully in our
2022 Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2022, our management team concluded that the material weakness had been addressed and that our internal
controls were effective. If we do not successfully maintain a strong controlled environment this could lead to heightened risk for financial
reporting mistakes and irregularities, and/or lead to a loss of public confidence in our internal controls that could have a negative
effect on the market price of our common stock. 

Our
articles of incorporation allow for our board to create a new series of preferred stock without further approval by our shareholders,
which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock. 

We
are authorized to issue ten million shares of preferred stock that has not been previously designated or issued, and our board has the
authority to define the relative rights and preferences of these shares of preferred stock without further shareholder approval. As a
result, our board could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our
assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the
right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. In addition, our board could
authorize the issuance of a new series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible
into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing shareholders.
The issuance of additional shares of preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock,
and therefore, reduce the value of our common stock. Although we have no present intention to issue any additional shares of preferred
stock or to create any additional series of preferred stock, we may issue such shares in the future. 

Our
articles of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control. 

Our
articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if closing
such a transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders. We are authorized to issue more than ten million shares of preferred stock
that has not been previously designated or issued. This preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be
determined at the time of issuance by our board without shareholder approval. Specific rights granted to future holders of preferred
stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell our assets to, a third party and, as a result, preserve control by
the present management. 

We
have nearly 400 million shares of authorized but unissued common stock. Our authorized but unissued shares of common stock are available
for future issuance without shareholder approval. These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate finance transactions,
acquisitions, and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock could make it more difficult
or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. 

7 

Provisions
of our articles of incorporation and bylaws also could have the effect of discouraging potential acquisition proposals or tender offers
or delaying or preventing a change in control, including changes a shareholder might consider favorable. These provisions may also prevent
or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management. In particular, the articles of incorporation and bylaws,
among other things: provide our board with the ability to alter the bylaws without shareholder approval; place limitations on the removal
of our directors; and provide that vacancies on our board may be filled by a majority of directors in office, although less than a quorum. 

The
market price of our common stock is volatile and can be adversely affected by numerous factors. 

The
share prices of publicly traded microcap and emerging companies, particularly companies without consistent product revenues and earnings,
can be highly volatile and are likely to remain highly volatile in the future. The price which investors may realize in sales of their
shares of our stock may be materially different than the price at which our stock is quoted, and will be influenced by a large number
of factors, some specific to us and our operations, and some unrelated to our operations. These factors may cause the price of our stock
to fluctuate frequently and substantially. Relevant factors may include large purchases or sales of our common stock, shorting of our
stock, positive or negative events, commentaries or publicity relating to our company, management or products, positive or negative events
relating to recreational vehicle companies generally, the publication of research by securities analysts and changes in recommendations
of securities analysts, legislative or regulatory changes, and/or general economic conditions. In the past, shareholder litigation, including
class action litigation, has been brought against other companies that experienced volatility in the market price of their shares or
unexpected or adverse developments in their business. Whether or not meritorious, litigation can result in substantial costs, divert
management s attention and resources, and harm the company s financial condition and results of operations. 

Our
Common Stock is considered a penny stock and may be difficult to sell. 

The
SEC has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security that has a market price of less
than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. Historically, the price of our
stock has fluctuated greatly. As of the date of this filing, the market price of our common stock is less than 5.00 per share, and therefore
is a penny stock according to SEC rules. The penny stock rules impose additional sales practice requirements
on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets
in excess of 1.0 million or annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by these
rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of securities and have received the purchaser s
written consent to the transaction before the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the
broker-dealer must deliver, before the transaction, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. The
broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations
for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information on the limited market in penny stocks.
These additional burdens imposed on broker-dealers may restrict the ability or decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to sell our
stock and may result in decreased liquidity for our stock and increased transaction costs for sales and purchases of our stock as compared
to other securities. 

Our
former CEO and one of our directors have been indicted for securities fraud. 

An
indictment was filed on September 16, 2021 and unsealed on October 8, 2021 against Paul Spivak, our former chief executive officer and
a major shareholder of the company, Mr. Spivak s wife, Olga Smirnova, our vice president of finance and administration and
a member of our board of directors, and others, alleging fraudulent sales of stock of USLG by Mr. Spivak and others United States
of America v. P. Spivak, O. Smirnova, et al. , Case No. L21CR491, United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio,
Eastern Division). We have been advised that Mr. Spivak and Ms. Smirnova have pled not guilty, vehemently deny the charges,
and are defending themselves aggressively. Although USLG is not a party to this case, the ongoing matter has impacted the willingness
of some parties to invest in or work with the company. In addition, if the case is decided against Mr. Spivak or Ms. Smirnova,
the company will be unable to utilize certain exemptions for private securities sales, which could negatively impact the ability of the
company to raise capital. 

The
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other U.S. securities laws impose substantial costs, and may drain our resources and
distract our management. 

We
are subject to certain of the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as the reporting requirements under the Exchange
Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure
controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. We have previously identified material weaknesses in our internal
controls. Substantial efforts and resources must be expended to maintain a controlled environment, which is difficult for a small company
like ours. Continued additional investments and management time to meet these requirements will be necessary since control weaknesses
raise the risk of future material errors in our financial statements. We may not be able to maintain effective controls over time. If
we have material weaknesses in the future, this may subject us to SEC enforcement action, which could include monetary fines or other
equitable remedies that could be detrimental to the ongoing business of the Company. 

We
do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, any return on your investment in our stock must come
from increases in the market price of our stock. 

We
have not paid any cash dividends on our stock to date in our history, and we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our stock in the
foreseeable future. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, for reinvestment in the development and expansion of our business. Also,
any credit agreements which we may enter into with institutional lenders may restrict our ability to pay dividends. Therefore, any return
on your investment in our stock must come from increases in the fair market value and trading price of our stock, which may not occur.

are statements other than historical facts, including, without limitation, statements that are identified by words like may, 
 could, would, should, will, believe, expect, anticipate, 
 plan, predict, estimate, target, project, intend, 
or similar expressions. These statements include, among others, statements regarding our current expectations, estimates and projections

subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. You should
not rely solely on these forward-looking statements and should consider all uncertainties and risks throughout this document. Forward-looking
statements are only predictions and not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to
update any forward-looking statement in light of new information or future events. 

Although
we believe that the expectations, estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking statements in this report are based on reasonable
assumptions when they were made, we cannot assure you that these expectations, estimates and projections will be achieved. We believe
the forward-looking statements in this report are reasonable; however, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement,

statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to: 

RVs
 are discretionary purchases, and our sales may be impacted by macroeconomic conditions that
 reduce discretionary spending, such as rising inflation and interest rates. 

RV
 dealers rely on floor plan financing to restock inventory, and our sales may be impacted
 if we are unable to provide additional floor plan financing options to our dealers. 

Additional
risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and also
could cause actual results to differ materially from those included, contemplated or implied by the forward-looking statements made in
this report, and you should not consider the factors listed above to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. All subsequent
written or oral forward-looking statements concerning USLG or other matters addressed in this report and attributable to us or any person

General
Overview 

US
Lighting Group, Inc. is a parent company comprised of four subsidiaries Cortes Campers, LLC, a brand of high-end molded fiberglass
campers, Futuro Houses, LLC, focused on design and sales of molded fiberglass homes, Fusion X Marine, LLC, a high-performance boat designer,
and MIGMarine Corporation, a composite manufacturing company that produces proprietary molded fiberglass products for our other business
lines. 

On
January 11, 2021, we formed Cortes Campers to operate our new brand of innovative travel trailers. During the second part of 2021, we
invested heavily in research and development as well as production planning for the 17-foot camper and began selling campers in early
2022. As of December 31, 2022, our revenue was driven by shipments of fiberglass campers marketed under Cortes Campers brand and financial
results for 2022 reflect revenue of 1,083,114 generated by Cortes Campers. 

10 

On
January 12, 2022, we formed Futuro Houses, LLC to design, marketing and distribute molded fiberglass homes. Throughout 2022, Futuro Houses
engaged in engineering and development of our first UFO themed home model inspired by the original Futuro house designed
by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen. As of December 31, 2022 , the division had not generated revenue. 

We
plan to expand our manufacturing footprint, enhance production techniques, and develop more products in the RV, marine, and composite
housing sectors. Current R D efforts are directed towards future tow-behind camper models under Cortes Campers brand as well as prefabricated
housing segment. 

On
August 5, 2022, we acquired Mig Marine from Paul Spivak, our former president and a significant shareholder. The Mig Marine acquisition
has been determined to be a combination of entities under common control that resulted in a change in the reporting entity. Accordingly,
our financial results have been recast to include the financial results of Mig Marine in the current and prior periods as if Mig Marine
had always been consolidated with USLG. The assets and liabilities of Mig Marine have been recorded in our consolidated statements of
financial condition at the seller s historical carrying value. 

On
May 14, 2021, we sold select assets of Intellitronix Corporation to Ohio INTX Cooperative, an Ohio cooperative association. In accordance
with the provisions of ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements, we have separately reported the assets and liabilities, revenue
and expenses related to Intellitronnix as discontinued operations. 

Results
of Operations 

Year
Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Sales

Total
sales from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 1,083,114, compared to 67,000 for the year ended December
31, 2021, an increase of 1,016,000 or more than 1,500 . The increase in sales is attributed to new sales through our Cortes Campers
subsidiary. During the current period all sales revenue was from Cortes Campers subsidiary. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold from continuing operations for the year ended the December 31, 2022 were 1,217,196 compared to 0 for the year ended the
December 31, 2021. The December 2022 cost of goods sold relates to camper sales from the Company s Cortes Campers subsidiary. 

Operating
Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A from
continuing operations were 1,603,565 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1,109,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021,
an increase of 494,566. The increase over the prior year can be primarily attributed to additional administrative staffing, auditing
and professional fees relating to our expanded operations. 

Product
development costs for the year ended the December 31, 2022, was 0 compared to 40,000 for the year ended the December 31, 2021. The
decrease is due to the Company changing its focus to the full production of RV, marine, composite housing, products rather than on development
of these product lines which was the focus in prior years. Cost related to product development for the year 2022, were capitalized into
work in process and finished goods inventories. 

Other
Income / Expense 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, we had total other expenses of 374,673, including: unrealized loss of 306,281, interest income of
 4,232 and 23,422 gain on disposal of fixed assets. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had total other income of 396,000.
We had other income of 70,000, extinguishment of debt of 52,000, an unrealized gain of 52,000, realized gain from investments of 121,000,
interest income of 15,000, interest expense of 9,000 and related party interest expense of 104,000. 

Net
Income (Loss)

had a net loss from continuing operations of 2,112,320 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 686,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2021. Our net loss from continuing operations decreased in the current year was mainly due to our other income items as
discussed above.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Management s
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires
management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to
impairment of long-lived assets, including finite lived intangible assets, accrued liabilities, fair value of warrant derivatives and
certain expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. 

Our
significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the
following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

Off-Balance

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that is material to investors.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of US Lighting Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements
of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In
addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 

We
determined that there are no critical audit matters.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management team, with the participation of our chief executive
officer, Anthony Corpora, and chief financial officer, Donald O. Retreage, Jr., evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
of USLG s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under the Securities Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Based upon
this evaluation, Messrs. Corpora and Retreage concluded that the company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of December 31, 2022. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

The USLG management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined under the Securities Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements. 

Our management team, with the participation of Messrs. Corpora
and Retreage, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria designated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control
 Integrated Framework (2013) . Based upon this evaluation, Messrs. Corpora and Retreage concluded that the company s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. 

Because USLG is a smaller reporting company as defined
by the SEC we are not required to include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our internal
control over financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
identified in connection with the evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

director of Intellitronix Corporation, a former subsidiary of USLG. Ms. Smirnova has over fifteen years of combined business experience
in the United States and Europe, which allowed her to design and implement flexible and resilient supply chain and organizational planning
solutions for domestic manufacturing companies, as well as several European import companies. Ms. Smirnova s education includes
a master s degree in Linguistics and Intercultural Communications from St. Petersburg State University of Culture in Russia.
Her strong experience in setting up international business networks, supply chain management, and integrated global solutions makes her
an asset to USLG as we expand into global markets. Ms. Smirnova is married to Paul Spivak, a significant shareholder of USLG and
the company s former chief executive officer. Mr. Spivak and Ms. Smirnova are the subject of an indictment alleging violations
of the Securities Act. Both Mr. Spivak and Ms. Smirnova have pled not guilty, vehemently deny the charges, and are defending
themselves aggressively. For more information about the case, please turn to Legal Proceedings on page 9. 

Board Committees 

Because our board of directors has only three members, all of whom
also serve as officers of the company, we do not currently have audit, compensation or other board committees. As our business expands,
we intend to add independent members to our board and form appropriate committees. 

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a code of ethics and business conduct that applies
to our directors and officers (including our chief executive and financial officers). Our code of ethics is reasonably designed to deter
wrongdoing and to promote: (1) honest and ethical conduct; (2) full and accurate disclosure in reports that we file with the
SEC; (3) compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations; (4) the prompt internal reporting of violations
of the code to our chief compliance officer; and (5) accountability for adherence to the code. Our code of ethics is available on
our website at www.USLightingGroup.com. 

Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports 

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires our directors,
executive officers and persons who own more than 10 of our common stock to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports
of changes in ownership of our common stock. Upon joining the board in February 2022, Patricia Salaciak failed to file her initial Form
3, but subsequently made the required filing. Donald Retreage failed to file his initial Form 3 upon joining USLG as chief financial officer
in September 2022, but later that month filed a Form 4 reporting his stock ownership. Based solely on our review of Forms 3 and 4 filed
with the SEC, we believe that all other Section 16(a) filing requirements were met timely in 2022.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director
Independence. 

Review and Approval of Transactions with Affiliates and Director
Independence 

Our board has adopted a written policy for the approval of transactions
between USLG and its directors, executive officers, and shareholders owning more than 5 of the company s stock, and each of their
respective immediate family members, where the amount involved in the transaction is more than 10,000. The policy provides that our board
must review transactions subject to the policy and determine whether to approve or ratify those transactions. If a director, or an immediate
family member of a director, is involved in the transaction, then the remaining independent directors will review the transaction. In
determining whether to approve a transaction with a related party, our independent directors will consider, among other factors they believe
to be relevant: (1) whether the transaction is in the ordinary course of business of USLG; (2) whether the transaction with
the related party is on terms no less favorable to the company than terms that could have been reached with an unrelated third party;
and (3) the purpose of, and the potential benefits to USLG of, the related party transaction. Certain types of transactions are treated
as pre-approved pursuant to standing pre-approval guidelines established by the board. Our related party transaction policy is available
on our website at www.USLightingGroup.com. 

The members of our board of directors are also officers and employees
of USLG and, as a result, are not considered to be independent directors. Although companies traded on the OTC Pink Market are not required
to have independent board members, as our business expands we intend to add members to our board who qualify as independent under the
OTCMarkets OTCQX Rules for U.S. Companies. 

Transactions with Affiliates in 2022 and 2021 

In 2022, Anthony Corpora, our CEO and a member of our board, loaned
 76,000 to USLG to fund operations while the Cortes Campers business was ramping up. The loan is interest free and is payable on demand.
The entire amount was outstanding on December 31, 2022. 

Paul Spivak is the founder and a significant shareholder of USLG. He
served as our CEO and sole member of our board until he stepped down from both positions on August 9, 2021. He remains an employee, involved
primarily in design and production. Mr. Spivak is married to board member Olga Smirnova. As the company s founder, we have
engaged in a number or transactions with Mr. Spivak as described below. 

Deferred Compensation 

Beginning in January 2018, Mr. Spivak voluntarily elected to defer
a portion of his salary to help the company conserve cash. In 2021 Mr. Spivak deferred 94,000 and in 2022 we paid 411,000 of the
previously deferred salary to him. The balance of deferred compensation owed to Mr. Spivak was 125,167 on December 31, 2022 and
 536,000 on December 31, 2021. 

Loans 

Mr. Spivak has made several loans to USLG to support operations.
In 2022, he loaned 100,000 to USLG to fund operations while the Cortes Campers business was ramping up. The loan is interest free and
is payable on demand. The entire amount was outstanding on December 31, 2022. In April 2020, Mr. Spivak loaned the company 408,000
bearing 6.0 interest. This loan had a term of twelve months and was repaid in full in 2021. In 2017, Mr. Spivak loaned the company
 125,000 interest free, which we repaid in full in 2021. 

In December 2016, we acquired Intellitronix Corporation from Mr. Spivak
for 4.0 million. Intellitronix was a manufacturer of automotive electronics with established product lines and distribution channels
that were complimentary to USLG s electronics manufacturing business at the time of the acquisition. The full amount of the purchase
price was payable over sixty months and carried interest at 6.25 . Mr. Spivak agreed to extend a portion of the note and on December
31, 2021 there was a balance outstanding of accrued interest only of 407,000, which was paid in full in 2022. 

MIGMarine Corporation 

On August 5, 2022, we acquired MIGMarine Corporation Mig Marine from Mr. Spivak for 6,833,333. The purchase price was completely seller-financed: 638,333 (10 was deferred for one year interest
free and is due August 5, 2023; and we issued Mr. Spivak a promissory note in the amount of 6,195,000 for the remainder. The note
bears interest at the rate of 6.25 per year and has a five-year term with monthly installments of principal and interest, with the final
payment on August 5, 2027. Mig Marine is a fiberglass design and manufacturing company that had been providing fabrication and assembly
services solely to Cortes Campers before the acquisition. By acquiring Mig Marine, we streamlined our manufacturing processes, improved
production cycles, and positioned the company to meet the expected increase in demand for Cortes campers in 2023. 

18 

On July 1, 2020, we entered a two-year commercial lease agreement with
Mig Marine to rent a portion of our manufacturing facilities to MIG for 5,000 per month. At the time, Mig Marine was owned by Mr. Spivak.
Mig Marine provided manufacturing services to the company and the lease was efficient for both USLG and Mig Marine. Under this arrangement
we received lease payments of 35,000 in 2022 and 60,000 in 2021. When we acquired Mig Marine from Mr. Spivak in 2022 we cancelled
the lease. In 2022, Cortes Campers paid Mig Marine 181,400 for campers completed by Mig Marine before the acquisition. We did not pay
Mig Marine for any services in 2021. From April to July of 2022, USLG provided administrative services to Mig Marine for 1,000 a month,
or 4,000 in total. 

Patents 

Mr. Spivak holds, or has applied for, a number of patents that
are used or would be useful in our business. We are not currently paying Mr. Spivak for access to these patents and are currently
in discussions with him to gain exclusive use of this intellectual property, which we believe will enable meaningful product innovation
and significant cost reductions in the current and future products. For more information, please turn to Business Patents 
on page 4. 

Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services. 

BF Borgers CPA PC Borgers served as our principal independent
registered public accounting firm in 2021 and in 2022 until August 1, 2022, when we engaged Maloney + Novotny LLC M+N to serve as our independent public accounting firm. M+N resigned on November 30, 2022, and we reengaged Borgers on February 22, 2023 to
audit our 2022 financial statements. The following table shows the fees billed by Borgers and M+N for the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021.

Our board of directors does not currently have an audit committee,
but all of the services provided by our independent public accounting firms in 2022 and 2021 were pre-approved by our board. The decision
to engage Borgers and M+N to serve as our independent public accounting firms was approved by our board. Neither Borgers nor M+N had any
direct or indirect financial interest in USLG that would compromise their independence in either 2022 or 2021.
