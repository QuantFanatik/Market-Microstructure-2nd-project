Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

We are a development stage corporation with limited
operations and revenues from our business operations. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe
there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months. We do not anticipate that we will
generate significant revenues until we have raised the funds necessary to conduct a marketing program. 

PLAN OF OPERATION 

FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 30, 2023 COMPARED TO FISCAL
YEAR ENDED APRIL 30, 2022. 

Our net loss for the fiscal year ended April 30,
2023 was 26,102 compared to a net loss of 200 during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. In April 30, 2023 we generated total revenue
of 1,200 and in April 30, 2022 the Company have not generated any revenue. 

Expenses incurred were 27,302 during fiscal year
ended April 30, 2023 compared to 200 during fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. 

The number of shares outstanding was 5,280,300
for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023 and 3,000,000 for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

FISCAL YEAR ENDED April 30, 2023 and 2022. 

As of April 30, 2023, our total assets were 55,016
consisting of Mobile Application and Website Development and Issuances of Common Shares. 

As of April 30, 2022, our total assets were 43,100. 

2 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

We have not generated positive cash flows from
operating activities. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, net cash flows used in operating activities was 25,027. For the fiscal
year ended April 30, 2022, net cash flows used in operating activities was 42,800. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

We have generated positive cash flows from investing
activities. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, net cash flows used in investing activities was 8,604. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

We have financed our operations primarily from
either advances from our sole executive or the issuance of equity. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing
activities was 36,943. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, net cash from financing activities was 300. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

GOING CONCERN 

There is no historical financial information about
us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have generated limited revenues. We cannot
guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business
enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. 

We have no assurance that future financing will
be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or
expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. 

The extent of the impact of the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak on the financial performance of the Company will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak
and related advisories and restrictions and the impact of COVID-19 on the overall economy, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot
be predicted. If the overall economy is impacted for an extended period, the Company s future operating results may be materially
adversely affected. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s
application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with
the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 

The Company s Financial Statements required
by Item 8, together with the reports thereon of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm are set forth on pages F-1 through F-9
of this report and are incorporated by reference in this Item 8. 

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accounting
and Financial Disclosures. 

None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management necessarily
applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable
assurance regarding management s control objectives. 

Our management, with the participation of our
CEO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this Report. Based upon this evaluation, our CEO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of
the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which is described below. 

Management s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Our internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective
internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tread way Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on
this evaluation, management concluded that that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of April 30, 2023.
Our CEO concluded we have a material weakness due to lack of segregation of duties, a limited corporate governance structure, and a lack
of a formal management review process over preparation of financial information. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

4 

Our size has prevented us from being able to employ
sufficient resources to enable us to have an adequate level of supervision and segregation of duties within our system of internal control.
Therefore, while there are some compensating controls in place, it is difficult to ensure effective segregation of accounting and financial
reporting duties. Management reported the following material weaknesses: 

Lack of segregation of duties in certain accounting and financial reporting processes including the initiation, processing, recording and approval of disbursements; 

Our corporate governance responsibilities are performed by the Board of Directors, none of whom are independent under applicable standards; we do not have an audit committee or compensation committee. Our Board of Directors acts primarily by written consent without meetings which results in several of our corporate governance functions not being performed concurrent (or timely) with the underlying transactions, including evaluation of the application of accounting principles and disclosures. 

Certain reports that we prepare, and accounting and reporting conclusions reached in connection with the financial statement preparation process are not subjected to a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review and are not submitted timely to the Board of Directors for review or approval; and 

While we strive to segregate duties as much as
practicable, there is an insufficient volume of transactions at this point in time to justify additional full-time staff. We believe that
this is typical in many development stage companies. We may not be able to fully remediate the material weakness until we commence operations
at which time, we would expect to hire more staff. We will continue to monitor and assess the costs and benefits of additional staffing. 

This Annual Report does not include an attestation
report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not
subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the SEC rules that permit us to provide only management s
report in this Annual Report. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended April 30, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers, and
Corporate Governance. 

Directors of the corporation are elected by the
stockholders to a term of 1 (one) year and serve until a successor is elected and qualified. Officers of the corporation are appointed
by the Board of Directors to a term of one year and serves until a successor is duly appointed and qualified, or until he or she is removed
from office. The Board of Directors has no nominating, auditing or compensation committees. 

Our executive officer and director, his name,
age, and his positions as of the date of this prospectus are as follows:

Resume 

Guy Pirotsky, Age 51 

Guy Pirotsky has acted as our President, Secretary,
Treasurer and sole Director since our incorporation on February 21, 2022. 

From September 2013, Mr. Pirotsky has been working
as a self-employed Inventor and Project manager. 

From 2001 to 2011, he worked at Israel Strategy
Runner as a Director, Product manager and GUI developer, Manager, SAS, SVM, Admin. 

From 2007 to present Mr. Pirotsky has been a successful
investor in start-ups and public companies. 

He got the Bachelor degree of Computer Science
and Statistics with honors in Bar-IIan University, Israel. 

Committees of the Board 

Our Company currently does not have nominating,
compensation or audit committees or committees performing similar functions, nor does our Company have a written nominating, compensation
or audit committee charter. Our director believes that it is not necessary to have such committees, at this time, because the functions
of such committees can be adequately performed by the sole director. 

Our Company does not have any defined policy or
procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors. The sole director believes that, given
the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop
to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the sole
director and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. The sole director, will assess all candidates,
whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment. 

A shareholder who wishes to communicate with our
sole director may do so by directing a written request addressed to our president and director, at the address appearing on the first
page of this Prospectus. 

Corporate Governance 

The Company promotes accountability for adherence
to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents
that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and in other public communications made by
the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. The Company has not formally adopted
a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company s employees, officers and directors as the Company is not
required to do so. 

6 

In lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company s
sole director is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope,
results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company's financial statements and other services provided by the Company s
independent public accountants. The sole director reviews the Company's internal accounting controls, practices and policies. 

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting
Compliance 

In the event that we register under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act or 1934 Act ), Section 16(a) of that act will require our directors
and executive officers, and persons who own more than ten percent of our common stock, to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
initial reports of ownership and reports of changes of ownership of our common stock. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent
stockholders will be required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 

We intend to ensure to the best of our ability
that all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners are complied
with in a timely fashion. 

Code of Business Conduct 

We have not adopted a Code of Business Conduct
within the meaning of Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K. 

Board Committees

other things, that the majority of the board of directors be independent. We are not currently subject to corporate governance standards
defining the independence of our directors, and we have chosen to define an independent director in accordance with the

not qualify as an independent director.

certain restrictions on the manner of sale, commencing six months after their acquisition. 

Any sale of shares held by the existing stockholder
(after applicable restrictions expire) and/or the sale of shares purchased in this offering (which would be immediately resalable after
the offering), may have a depressive effect on the price of our common stock in any market that may develop, of which there can be no

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors Natics Corp. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet
of Natics Corp. (the Company as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders'
equity, from inception to the period ended April 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30,
2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows from inception to the period ended April 30, 2023, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern Uncertainty 

The Company's financial statements are prepared
using the generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has an accumulated deficit of 26,302 and a negative cash flow from operations
amounting to 26,102 from inception to the period ended April 30, 2023. These factors as discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements
raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are
also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters arising from the current
period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate
to accounts or disclosure that are material to the financial statements and (2) involve especially challenging, subjective, or complex
judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a
whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit maters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or
on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

There is no Critical Audit Matters existed as
of April 30, 2023.

 NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FOR THE YEARS ENDED APRIL 30, 2023 AND 2022 

as of April 30, 2023. The Company currently
has losses and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an
extended period of time. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management
anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The
Company intends to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s
efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and
continue as a going concern. 

. 

The three levels are defined as follows: 

Level 1: 
 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
 
 Level 2: 
 defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and 
 
 Level 3: 
 defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.

that may be available to reduce future years' taxable income in varying amounts through 2041. 

Future tax benefits which arise as a result of
these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly,
the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards. 

The 21 tax rate provision for Federal income
tax consists of the following: 

Related party accruals
