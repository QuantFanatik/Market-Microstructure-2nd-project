Industry
and Regulatory Overview 

As
of the date of this filing, thirty-nine states, including the state of Colorado, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. Territories,
currently have laws broadly legalizing cannabis in some form for either medicinal or recreational use governed by state-specific laws
and regulations. Although legalized in some states, cannabis is a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substances Act (21
U.S.C. 811) CSA and is illegal under federal law. 

On
August 29, 2013, The Department of Justice set out its prosecutorial priorities in light of various states legalizing cannabis for medicinal
and/or recreational use. The Cole Memorandum provided that when states have implemented strong and effective regulatory
and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with those
laws and regulations is less likely to threaten the federal priorities. Indeed, a robust system may affirmatively address those priorities
by, for example, implementing effective measures to prevent diversion of cannabis outside of the regulated system and to other states,
prohibiting access to cannabis by minors, and replacing an illicit cannabis trade that funds criminal enterprises with a tightly regulated
market in which revenues are tracked and accounted for. In those circumstances, consistent with the traditional allocation of federal-state
efforts in this area, the Cole Memorandum provided that enforcement of state law by state and local law enforcement and regulatory bodies
should remain the primary means of addressing cannabis-related activity. If state enforcement efforts are not sufficiently robust to
protect against the harms set forth above, the federal government may seek to challenge the regulatory structure itself in addition to
continuing to bring individual enforcement actions, including criminal prosecutions, focused on those harms. 

1 

On
January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum for all United States Attorneys concerning cannabis enforcement under
the CSA. Mr. Sessions rescinded all previous prosecutorial guidance issued by the Department of Justice regarding cannabis, including
the August 29, 2013 Cole Memorandum . 

In
rescinding the Cole Memorandum, Mr. Sessions stated that U.S. Attorneys must decide whether or not to pursue prosecution of cannabis
activity based upon factors including: the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative
impact of particular crimes on the community. Mr. Sessions reiterated that the cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana
continues to be a crime under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act. 

On
March 23, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law a 1.3 trillion-dollar spending bill that included an amendment known as Rohrabacher-Blumenauer, 
which prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to prevent certain states from implementing their own State laws
that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical cannabis. 

On
December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, otherwise known as the Farm
Bill. Prior to its passage, hemp, a member of the cannabis family, was classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, and so
illegal under the federal CSA. 

With
the passage of the Farm Bill, hemp cultivation is now broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived
products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived
products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law. 

Under
Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC. THC is the chemical compound found in cannabis that produces
the psychoactive high associated with cannabis. Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3 percent THC would be considered
non-hemp cannabis or marijuana under the CSA and would not be legally protected under this new legislation and would be treated
as an illegal Schedule 1 drug. 

Additionally,
there will be significant, shared state-federal regulatory power over hemp cultivation and production. Under Section 10113 of the Farm
Bill, state departments of agriculture must consult with the state s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan
that must be submitted to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the USDA ).
A state s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of USDA approves that state s plan. In states
opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states
must apply for licenses and comply with a federally run program. This system of shared regulatory programming is similar to options states
had in other policy areas such as health insurance marketplaces under Affordable Care Act, or workplace safety plans under Occupational
Health and Safety Act both of which had federally-run systems for states opting not to set up their own systems. 

 The
Farm Bill outlines actions that are considered violations of federal hemp law (including such activities as cultivating without a license
or producing cannabis with more than 0.3 percent THC). The Farm Bill details possible punishments for such violations, pathways for violators
to become compliant, and even which activities qualify as felonies under the law, such as repeat offenses. 

One
of the goals of the previous 2014 Farm Bill was to generate and protect research into hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill continues this effort.
Section 7605 re-extends the protections for hemp research and the conditions under which such research can and should be conducted. Further,
section 7501 of the Farm Bill extends hemp research by including hemp under the Critical Agricultural Materials Act. This provision recognizes
the importance, diversity, and opportunity of the plant and the products that can be derived from it but also recognizes that there is
still a lot to learn about hemp and its products from commercial and market perspectives. 

As
a result of the November 2020 federal elections and the election of Joseph R. Biden as president, there is speculation that the federal
government may move to amend parts of the CSA and de-schedule cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug. 

In
late January 2021, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said lawmakers are in the process of merging various cannabis bills, including
his own legalization legislation. He is working to enact reform in this Congressional session. This would include the Marijuana Freedom
and Opportunity Act, which would federally de-schedule cannabis, reinvest tax revenue into communities most affected by the drug war,
and fund efforts to expunge prior cannabis records. It is likely that the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment, and Expungement (MORE)
Act would be incorporated. 

2 

Other
federal legislation under review for possible submission includes the SAFE Banking Act (or Secure and Fair Enforcement Act), a bill that
would allow cannabis companies to access the federally insured banking system and capital markets without the risk of federal enforcement
action, and the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act (or STATES Act), a bill that seeks protections for businesses
and individuals in states that have legalized and comply with state laws). 

The
fall of 2022 saw several key developments in federal and state marijuana regulation. In October 2022, President Biden granted clemency
to certain low-level federal marijuana offenders and directed the Attorney General to review the status of marijuana under federal law.
While some observers consider President Biden s grant of clemency to represent a significant change in federal marijuana policy,
as a legal matter, it did little to alter the growing disparity between federal and state marijuana regulation. Then, in November 2022,
voters in five states considered ballot initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana at the state level, two of which were adopted.
Congress also subsequently enacted the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act, which aims to facilitate research on
marijuana and cannabidiol (CBD). Legislators and commentators have proposed a number of other legal reforms that would alter federal
marijuana regulation and potentially reduce the divergence between federal and state law. 

As
of the date of this filing, cannabis remains an illegal Schedule 1 drug under the CSA, and none of the legislative initiatives being
discussed have become federal law. 

Notably,
with respect to our business, on November 1, 2019, Colorado Bill HB-19-1090 was passed and made effective. This law allows publicly traded
corporations to apply for and qualify for the ownership of Colorado cannabis licenses. Other states that have legalized cannabis for
recreational and/or medicinal use restrict public companies from owning interests in state cannabis licenses altogether or have enacted
regulations that make it difficult for corporations to comply with application requirements, including all shareholders submitting to
and passing background checks. 

On
September 18, 2020, Colorado s Marijuana Enforcement Division (MED), approved the Company s application for the suitability,
establishing the Company as one of the few publicly traded companies authorized to acquire and operate various cannabis licenses throughout
Colorado, in both the recreational and medical markets.

Equipment and
Supplies 

In
addition to professional consulting services, we operate an equipment and supplies division for customers in the cannabis industry. Our
Group Purchasing Organization, American Cultivator CO., enables customers to procure commonly used cultivation supplies at competitive
prices. Our major product offerings include the following: 

o 
 The
 Satchel . The Satchel was invented in response to regulatory changes in Colorado and elsewhere that require childproof
 exit containers. The Satchel is a pouch-like case designed as a high-quality, child-proof exit package solution for the regulated
 cannabis industry. The Satchel meets child-safety requirements of the Consumer Products Safety Commission CPSC ), making
 it compliant in all states, and the Satchel s drawstring and toggle lock fulfills the requirements of the Poison Prevention
 Packaging Act of 1970 (16 CFR part 1700). There are few products meeting regulatory standards, and even fewer that offer distinctive
 quality. The Satchel will meet all current exit packaging regulations, featuring a child-proof closure that completely conceals the
 contents inside. On March 29, 2016, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued us Patent No. 9,296,524 B2 for the Satchel. 

o 
 SoHum
 Living Soil . The right grow methodology is critical to the success of any cannabis cultivation operation, and SoHum Living
 Soil is our solution to ensure that our customers can implement an optimal methodology that will maximize quality and yields
 while simplifying the cultivation process and reducing risk of operator error and test failure. The SoHum medium is a fully amended
 Just-add-water soil that contains none of the synthetic components found in other potting mixes and requires no chemical additives
 to spur growth. Compared with comparable methodologies, SoHum Living Soil offers a number of key advantages, including: (1)
 consistent Pyto-pharmaceutical-grade product quality; (2) improved plant resistance to disease; and (3) reduced operator error. 

o 
 High
 Density Cultivation System (HDCS ). A key metric in the success of a cultivation operation is the maximization of available
 space to grow. Our High-Density Cultivation System is a solution designed to ensure that space is used in the most efficient manner
 possible. The system takes advantage of the existence of vertical space, with racks installed vertically and placed on horizontal
 tracking to eliminate multiple isles and create multiple levels of space with which to grow plants. The High-Density Cultivation
 System allows customers to increase production capacity without the need to add additional square footage to the operation. 

o 
 The
 Cultivation Cube . The Cultivation Cube is a self-contained, scalable cultivation system that is compliant with
 regulatory guidelines. The Cultivation Cube allows commercial cannabis cultivation operations to maximize space, yield and
 profit through an innovative design that provides a fully integrated growing solution. The Cultivation Cube utilizes more lights
 per square foot than traditional grow systems, which translates to profit increases per square foot. The Cultivation Cube 
 is also stackable, which allows customers to achieve vertical gains and effectively doubles productive square-footage. It is an ideal
 solution for commercial-scale cultivation within limited space, with numerous advantages over other traditional grow systems, including:
 (1) flexibility to fit customer build-out sites; (2) efficient speed-to-market with fast delivery and setup; (3) increased security
 with limited access units; (4) risk mitigation through precision environmental controls; and, (5) is compatible with lean manufacturing
 principles and operations. 

o 
 Other
 Products. We offer our clients a diverse array of commonly utilized product offerings from across all areas of the regulated
 cannabis industry, including cultivation operations, medicinal and recreational cannabis dispensary operations, and infused products.
 Examples of products available include HID Ballasts, reflectors, MH and HPS bulbs, T5 fixtures, mediums, nutrients and fertilizers,
 growing containers, flood tables, reservoirs, and various other supplies, including cleaning products and office supplies.

We intend to expand our offerings to more countries, states and jurisdictions as they adopt state-regulated or Federal programs.

As
a component of our equipment and supplies offerings, from time-to-time we design and develop our own proprietary products to meet demand
in markets where current offerings are insufficient. These products include, but are not limited to: The Satchel , Cultivation
Cube , So-Hum Living Soils and the HDCS . Costs associated with the development of new products are expensed as occurred

Intellectual
Property 

On
March 29, 2016, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued patent number 9,296,524 B2 for The Satchel , our child-proof exit package
solution for the regulated cannabis industry. On March 14, 2015, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued trademark #86574785 for
the two-word marks and the logo associated with So-Hum Living Soil . 

Competition 

Our
competitors include professional services firms and cannabis dispensaries in the regulated cannabis industry, as well as suppliers of
equipment and supplies commonly utilized in the cultivation, processing, or retail sale of cannabis. We compete in markets where cannabis
has been legalized and regulated, which includes various states within the United States, it s territories and Indian Country therein
and Canada. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the cannabis industry
matures. Additionally, increased competition is possible to the extent that new states and geographies enter the marketplace as a result
of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes that de-criminalize and regulate cannabis products. We believe that by being
well established in the industry, our experience and success to date, and our continued expansion of service and product offerings in
new and existing locations, are factors that mitigate the risk associated with operating in a developing competitive environment. Additionally,
the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result in new customers entering the marketplace, thereby further mitigating
the impact of competition on our operations and results. 

Employees 

As
of December 31, 2022, we have 9 full-time employees in our Denver headquarters, and 15 full-time employees in our Colorado Springs, Colorado

impairment, net lease intangibles, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual
results will not differ from those estimates.

the year ended December 31, 2021, comprised of consulting services gross profit of 344,915, products and equipment gross profit of 279,022,
and cannabis products gross profit of 432,211. 

Operating
Expenses 

Total operating
expenses were 3,142,870 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with 2,696,881, for the year ended December 31, 2021, an
increase of 445,989. The increase is attributed to the payment of 175,000 for a litigation settlement expense, combined with increases
in general and administrative, legal, and accounting and advertising costs during the period. 

10 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Other
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 27,536 as compared to other income of 201,484 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease is a result of a decrease in debt forgiveness and increases in interest expenses resulting from travel and miscellaneous
referral fees due for the sale of products and equipment. 

Net Loss 

Net
loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 633,192, as compared to a net loss of 1,439,249 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease in losses is a direct result of growth in cannabis product sales, product and equipment sales, and a reduction in litigation
expenses. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

As of December 31,
2022, our primary internal sources of liquidity were our working capital, which included cash and cash equivalents of 117,547 and accounts
receivable of 496,111. Additionally, considering that our fixed overhead costs are low, we have the ability to issue stock to compensate
employees and management. Management believes that it will need to raise short-term capital to mitigate any periodic delays in receipt
of accounts receivable, as payments from third-party vendors are scheduled on a less-than-periodic timetable. Management believes this
strategy will adequately provide the necessary liquidity and capital resources to fund our operational and general, and administrative
expenses for at least the next 12 months. 

During the year ended
December 31, 2022, the Company issued 2,500,000 registered shares of common stock in exchange for net proceeds of 117,629 pursuant to
the Common Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on October 11, 2019, with White Lion Capital LLC. The Common Stock Purchase Agreement
was terminated on October 11, 2022. 

Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was 198,965 and 957,978 respectively. Decreases in
cash used were a result of reductions in inventory, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, and an increase in litigation settlement expense
depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and accounts payable. 

Investing
Activities 

For
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, cash used in investing activites was 103,675 and 1,465,960, respectively. The decreases
were the result of reductions of cash payments related to the acquisition of the assets of Naturaleaf of 1,100,000 and expenditures
of equipment and leasehold improvements for the cultivation and dispensary facilities of 357,801. 

Financing
Activities 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in financing activities was 250,236 and cash provided by financing activities was 1,371,229
for the year ended December 31, 2021. Funds received during the year ended December 31, 2022, were from the sale of shares of the Company s
registered common stock as reduced by a payment of a note payable pursuant to an amendment of the material definitive agreement related
to the purchase of the Naturaleaf assets. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of December 31, 2022 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or
future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates
and judgments that affect amounts reported in those statements. We have made our best estimates of certain amounts contained in our consolidated
financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities.
However, application of our accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties,
and, as a result, actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Management believes that the estimates, assumptions, and
judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

We
cannot predict what future laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations. We assess
the impact of significant changes in laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare
our financial statements when we deem it necessary. 

Cash and Cash
Equivalents 

 We
consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents
are held in operating accounts at a major financial institution. 

Inventory 

Inventory
is primarily comprised of products and equipment to be sold to end-customers. Inventory is valued at cost, based on the specific identification
method, unless and until the market value for the inventory is lower than cost, in which case an allowance is established to reduce the
valuation to market value. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, market values of all of our inventory were greater than cost,
and accordingly, no such valuation allowances was recognized. 

Deposits 

Deposits
is comprised of advance payments made to third parties, primarily for inventory for which we have not yet taken title. When we take title
to inventory for which deposits are made, the related amount is classified as inventory, then recognized as a cost of revenues upon sale
(see Costs of Revenues below). 

Prepaid Expenses
and Other Current Assets 

 Prepaid
expenses and other current assets are primarily comprised of advance payments made to third parties for independent contractors 
services or other general expenses. Prepaid services and general expenses are amortized over the applicable periods which approximate
the life of the contract or service period. 

Accounts Receivable 

 Accounts
receivable are recorded at the net value of face amount less any allowance for doubtful accounts. On a periodic basis, we evaluate our
accounts receivable and, based on a method of specific identification of any accounts receivable for which we deem the net realizable
value to be less than the gross amount of accounts receivable recorded, we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for those balances.
In determining our need for an allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider historical experience, analysis of past due amounts, client
creditworthiness and any other relevant available information. However, our actual experience may vary from our estimates. If the financial
condition of our clients were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability or unwillingness to pay our fees, we may need to record additional
allowances or write-offs in future periods. This risk is mitigated to the extent that we collect retainers from our clients prior to
performing significant services. 

The
allowance for doubtful accounts, if any, is recorded as a reduction in revenue to the extent the provision relates to fee adjustments
and other discretionary pricing adjustments. To the extent the provision relates to a client's inability to make required payments on
accounts receivables, the provision is recorded in operating expenses. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our allowance for doubtful accounts
was 64,344 and 82,540 , respectively. For December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded bad debt expense of 5,438 and 54,435,
respectively. 

Operating Leases Right-of-use Assets 

 The Company recognizes
its leases in accordance with ASC 842 - Leases. Under ASC 842, operating lease right-of-use ROU assets and liabilities
are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets represent our right
to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the
lease. The initial lease liability equals the future fixed minimum lease payments discounted using the Company s incremental borrowing
rate on a secured basis. The lease term includes option renewal periods and early termination payments when it is reasonably certain
that the Company will exercise those rights. The initial measurement of the ROU asset equals the initial lease liability plus any initial
direct costs and prepayments, less any lease incentives. The Company elected the short-term lease exemption for contracts with lease
terms of 12 months or less. The Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components of its leases as a single lease component. Lease
expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company had no leases as of December 31, 2022, and 2021 that
had financing components. 

12 

Property and
Equipment, net 

 Property
and Equipment are stated at net book value, cost less depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation of
owned equipment is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from two to seven years.
Depreciation of capitalized construction in progress costs, a component of property and equipment, net, begins once the underlying asset
is placed into service and is recognized over the estimated useful life. Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment as discussed
below under Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. We did not capitalize any interest for the years ended
December 31, 2022, and 2021. 

Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

We
evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, the recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount
of an asset to forecasted undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds
its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is
determined based on discounted cash flows, appraised values, or management's estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets. We have
not recorded any impairment charges related to long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Revenue Recognition 

 We adopted the following
accounting principles related to revenue recognition: (a) FASB ASU 2016-12 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
 Due to the nature of our contracts with customers, adopting the new accounting principles did not have a significant impact on our
prior period results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 

Our service and product
revenues arise from contracts with customers. Service revenue includes Operations Divisions consulting revenue. Product revenue includes
(a) Operations Division product sales (So-Hum Living Soils), (b) Equipment sales division, (c) Cannabis sales division. The majority
of our revenue is derived from distinct performance obligations, such as time spent delivering a service or the delivery of a specific
product. 

We may also enter
into contracts with customers that identify a single, or few, distinct performance obligations, but that also have non-distinct, underlying
performance obligations. These contracts are typically fulfilled within one to six months. Only an insignificant portion of our revenue
would be assessed for allocation between distinct (contractual) performance obligations and non-distinct deliverables between reporting
periods and, accordingly, we do not record a contract asset for completed, non-distinct performance obligations prior to invoicing the
customer. 

We recognize revenue in accordance with
ASC 606 using the following 5 steps to identify revenues: 

(1) 
 Identify the contract
 with the Customer. Our customary practice is to obtain written evidence, typically in the form of a contract or purchase
 order. 

(2) 
 Identify the performance
 obligations in the contract. We have rights to payment when services are completed in accordance with the underlying contract,
 or for the sale of goods when custody is transferred to our customers either upon delivery to our customers locations, with
 no right of return or further obligations. 

(3) 
 Determination of the
 transaction price. Prices are typically fixed, and no price protections or variables are offered. 

(4) 
 Allocation of the transaction
 price to the performance obligations in the contract . Transaction prices are typically allocated to the performance obligations
 outlined in the contract. 

(5) 
 Recognize Revenue when
 (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We typically require a retainer for all or a portion of the goods
 or services to be delivered. We recognize revenue as the performance obligations detailed in the contract are met. 

Advances from Clients
deposits are contract liabilities with customers that represent our obligation to either transfer goods or services in the future, or
refund the amount received. Where possible, we obtain retainers to lessen our risk of non-payment by our customers. Advances from Clients
deposits are recognized as revenue as we meet specified performance obligations as detailed in the contract. 

Product and Equipment
Sales 

Revenue from product
and equipment sales, including delivery fees, is recognized when an order has been obtained from the customer, the price is fixed and
determinable when the order is placed, the product is delivered, the title has been transferred, and collectability is reasonably assured.
Generally, our suppliers drop-ship orders to our clients with destination terms. The Company realizes revenue upon delivery to the customer.
Given the facts that (1) our customers exercise discretion in determining the timing of when they place their product order, and (2)
the price negotiated in our product sales contracts is fixed and determinable at the time the customer places the order, we are not of
the opinion that our product sales indicate or involve any significant financing that would materially change the amount of revenue recognized
under the contract, or would otherwise contain a significant financing component for the customer or us under FASB ASC Topic 606. During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, sales returns were 0. 

13 

Consulting Services 

We also generate
revenues from professional services consulting agreements. These arrangements are generally entered into: (1) on an hourly basis for
a fixed fee; or (2) on a contingent fee basis. Generally, we require a complete For hourly-based fixed-fee service contracts, we utilize
and rely upon the proportional performance method, which recognizes revenue as services are completed. Under this method, in order to
determine the amount of revenue to be recognized, we calculate the amount of completed work in comparison to the total services to be
provided under the arrangement or deliverable. We segregate upon entry into a contract any advances or retainers received from clients
for fixed fee hourly services into a separate Advances from Clients account and only recognize revenues as we incur and
charge billable hours, and then deposit the funds earned into our operating account. Because our hourly fees for services are fixed and
determinable and are only earned and recognized as revenue upon actual performance, we are of the opinion that such arrangements are
not an indicator of a vendor or customer-based significant financing that would materially change the amount of revenue we recognize
under the contract or would otherwise contain a significant financing component under FASB ASC Topic 606. 

Occasionally, our
fixed-fee hourly engagements are recognized under the completed performance method. Some fixed fee arrangements are for the completion
of a final deliverable or act which is significant to the arrangement. These engagements do not generally exceed a one-year term. If
the performance is for a final deliverable or act, we recognize revenue under the completed performance method, in which revenue is recognized
once the final act or deliverable is performed or delivered for a fixed fee. Revenue recognition is affected by a number of factors that
change the estimated amount of work required to complete the deliverable, such as changes in scope, timing, awaiting notification of
license award from the local government, and the level of client involvement. Losses, if any, on fixed-fee engagements are recognized
in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. FASB ASC Topic 606 provides a practical expedient to
disregard the effects of a financing component if the period between payment and performance is one year or less. As our fixed fee hourly
engagements do not exceed one year, no significant customer-based financing is implicated under FASB ASC Topic 606. During the years
ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, we incurred no losses from fixed fee engagements that terminate prior to completion. We believe that
if an engagement terminates prior to completion, we can recover the costs incurred related to the services provided. 

We primarily enter
into arrangements for which fixed and determinable revenues are contingent and agreed upon achieving a pre-determined deliverable or
future outcome. Any contingent revenue for these arrangements is not recognized until the contingency is resolved and collectability
is reasonably assured. 

Our arrangements
with clients may include terms to deliver multiple services or deliverables. These contracts specifically identify the services to be
provided with the corresponding deliverable. The value for each deliverable is determined based on the prices charged when each element
is sold separately or by other vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE or estimates of stand-alone selling prices. Revenues
are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the elements as described above (see Product Sales). The elements qualify
for separation when the deliverables have value on a stand-alone basis, and the value of the separate elements can be established by
VSOE or an estimated selling price. 

While assigning values
and identifying separate elements requires judgment, selling prices of the separate elements are generally readily identifiable as fixed
and determinable as we also sell those elements individually outside of a multiple services engagement. Contracts with multiple elements
typically incorporate a fixed-fee or hourly pricing structure. Arrangements are typically terminable by either party upon sufficient
notice or do not include provisions for refunds relating to services provided. 

Reimbursable expenses,
including those relating to travel, other out-of-pocket expenses, and any third-party costs, are included as a component of revenues.
Typically, an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in total direct client service costs. Reimbursable expenses related
to time and materials and fixed-fee engagements are recognized as revenue in the period in which the expense is incurred, and collectability
is reasonably assured. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recognized as liabilities and paid
to the appropriate government entities. 

Cannabis Sales 

Revenues consist
of the retail sale of cannabis and related products. Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail customers. Payment is typically
due upon transferring the goods to the customer or within a specified time period permitted under the Company s credit policy.
Sales discounts were not material during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

14 

Costs of Revenues 

 Our
policy is to recognize costs of revenue in the same manner in conjunction with revenue recognition. Cost of revenues includes the costs
directly attributable to revenue recognition and includes compensation and fees for services, travel, and other expenses for services
and costs of products and equipment. Selling, general and administrative expenses are charged to expense as incurred. 

Advertising
and Promotion Costs 

 Advertising
and promotion costs are included as a component of selling and marketing expense and are expensed as incurred. During the year ended
December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, these costs were 225,950 and 116,122, respectively. 

Shipping and
Handling Costs 

 For
product and equipment sales, shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of revenues. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

 Restricted
shares are awarded to employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of restricted common stock at the end of the established vesting
period. The fair value of the grant is based on the stock price on the date of grant. We recognize related compensation costs on a straight-line
basis over the requisite vesting period of the award, which to date has been one year from the grant date. During the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, stock-based compensation expense for restricted shares for Company employees was 78,342 and 42,206, respectively.
Compensation expense for warrants is based on the fair value of the instruments on the grant date, which is determined using the Black-Scholes
valuation model and is expensed over the expected term of the awards. During the year ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, no warrants
were issued as stock compensation. 

Income
Taxes 

 Our
corporate status changed from an S-Corporation, which it had been since inception, to a C-Corporation during the year ended December
31, 2014. As provided in Section 1361 of the Internal Revenue Code, for income tax purposes, S-Corporations are not subject to corporate
income taxes; instead, the owners are taxed on their proportionate share of the S-Corporation s taxable income. Accordingly, we
were only subject to income taxes for a portion of 2014. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns in accordance with applicable accounting guidance
for accounting for income taxes, using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
We record a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. For the year ended
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, due to cumulative losses since our corporate status changed, we recorded a valuation allowance
against our deferred tax asset that reduced our income tax benefit for the period to zero. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31,
2021, we had no liabilities related to federal or state income taxes, and the carrying value of our deferred tax asset was zero. The
years 2010 to 2022 remain subject to examination by the Company s major tax jurisdictions. 

Due
to its cannabis operations, the Company is subject to the limitations of Internal Revenue Code IRC Section 280E,
under which the Company is only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to sales of the product. This results in permanent differences
between ordinary and necessary business expenses deemed non-allowable under IRC Section 280E. 

 Net Loss Per
Common Share 

 We
report net loss per common share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings per Share . This statement requires dual presentation
of basic and diluted earnings with a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the earnings per share computations. Basic net
loss per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the period and excludes the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted net income (loss) per share
gives effect to any dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the period. The computation does not assume conversion, exercise
or contingent exercise of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings. 

15 

Related Party
Transactions 

 We
follow FASB ASC subtopic 850-10, Related Party Transactions , for the identification of related parties and disclosure of
related party transactions. 

Pursuant
to ASC 850-10-20, related parties include: a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their equity securities
would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825 10 15,
to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit
sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the Company; e) management of the Company;
f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies
of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and
g) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership
interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting
parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. 

Material
related party transactions are required to be disclosed in the consolidated financial statements, other than compensation arrangements,
expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated
in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include:
(a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; (b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or
nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which statements of operation are presented, and such other information deemed
necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; (c) the dollar amounts of transactions
for each of the periods for which statements of operations are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing
the terms from that used in the preceding period; and (d) amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet
presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.

 ITEM
8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of American Cannabis Company, Inc. 

 Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

 We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of American Cannabis Company, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022, and
the related consolidated statement of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for year ended December 31, 2022, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

 Going
Concern 

 The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has a working capital deficit, has generated net losses since its inception and further losses
are anticipated. The Company requires additional funds to meet its obligations and the costs of its operations. These factors raise substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note
2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

 Emphasis
of Matter on Company s Operations 

 The
Company is an organization that provides products and services in the legalized cannabis industry. The Company operates in an industry
where laws and regulations vary significantly by jurisdiction. Currently, several states permit medicinal or recreational use of cannabis;
however, the use of cannabis is prohibited on a federal level in the United States. If any of the states that permit use of cannabis
were to change their laws or the federal government was to actively enforce such prohibition, the Company s business could be adversely
affected. The Company also currently accepts credit card payments for purchases of legal cannabis at their retail locations. At any given
time, the credit card companies may cease to process credit card payments for these sales, which could cause significant interruption
in the Company s operations. 

 Basis
for Opinion 

 These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Critical
Audit Matters 

 The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters

matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

 Acquisitions

The
Company closed its acquisition of the assets of Medihemp, LLC, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, doing business as Naturaleaf 
in the medicinal cannabis industry during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company accounted for the acquisitions under the acquisition
method of accounting for business combination. The Company began assessing the fair value of assets acquired during the year ended December
31, 2021 and recorded preliminary estimates related to the acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company finalized
their assessment of the purchase price allocation through the use of a third-party valuation specialist regarding the intangible asset
and goodwill values.

 Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB Number 324) 

Board
of Directors and Shareholders 

 American
Cannabis Company, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Cannabis Company, Inc. (the Company as of December
31, 2021, and the related consolidated statement of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and
the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Substantial
Doubt About the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit, recurring losses, and expects continuing future losses. As of
December 31, 2021, the Company has an accumulated deficit of 9,447,517. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company also experienced
negative cash flows from operating activities of 957,978. It appears these principal conditions or events, considered in the aggregate,
indicate it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date the
financial statements are issued. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Emphasis
of Matter Related to the Company s Operations 

The
Company is an organization that provides products and services in the legalized cannabis industry. The Company operates in an industry
where laws and regulations vary significantly by jurisdiction. Currently, several states permit medicinal or recreational use of cannabis;
however, the use of cannabis is prohibited on a federal level in the United States. If any of the states that permit use of cannabis
were to change their laws or the federal government was to actively enforce such prohibition, the Company s business could be adversely
affected. The Company also currently accepts credit card payments for purchases of legal cannabis at their retail locations. At any given
time, the credit card companies may cease to process credit card payments for these sales, which could cause significant interruption
in the Company s operations. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the entity s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. the Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We recognize revenue in accordance with
ASC 606 using the following 5 steps to identify revenues: 

(1) 
 Identify the contract
 with the Customer. Our customary practice is to obtain written evidence, typically in the form of a contract or purchase
 order. 

(2) 
 Identify the performance
 obligations in the contract. We have rights to payment when services are completed in accordance with the underlying contract,
 or for the sale of goods when custody is transferred to our customers either upon delivery to our customers locations, with
 no right of return or further obligations. 

(3) 
 Determination of the
 transaction price. Prices are typically fixed, and no price protections or variables are offered. 

(4) 
 Allocation of the transaction
 price to the performance obligations in the contract . Transaction prices are typically allocated to the performance obligations
 outlined in the contract. 

(5) 
 Recognize Revenue when
 (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We typically require a retainer for all or a portion of the goods
 or services to be delivered. We recognize revenue as the performance obligations detailed in the contract are met. 

Advances from Clients
deposits are contract liabilities with customers that represent our obligation to either transfer goods or services in the future, or
refund the amount received. Where possible, we obtain retainers to lessen our risk of non-payment by our customers. Advances from Clients
deposits are recognized as revenue as we meet specified performance obligations as detailed in the contract.

and 
 , respectively. Compensation expenses for warrants
are based on the fair value of the instruments on the grant date, which is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and are
expensed over the expected term of the awards. During the year ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, no warrants were issued as stock compensation.

of 12 and a maturity date of April 29, 2023. 

The

As the acquirer for accounting purposes, the Company has estimated the fair value of Medihemp LLC and Medical Cannabis Caregivers, Inc. s
(hereafter Naturaleaf s assets acquired and conformed the accounting policies of Naturaleaf to its own accounting
policies. The Company expensed certain legal, auditing and licensing costs with the acquisition of .

On July 12, 2022,
the Company entered into an accommodation for office space, effective September 1, 2022, located at 200 Union St., Suite 200, Lakewood,
CO 80228. The accommodation creates no tenancy, leasehold or other real property interest concerning the Registrant. The Registrant's
telephone number is unchanged. We determined under ASC 842, due to the nature of the accommodation that the membership agreement met
the criteria of ASC 842-20-25-2, and as such, it was not necessary to capitalize the accomodation, and the membership fee will be recognized
on a monthly straight-line basis. 

On May 1, 2020, as
part of the Naturaleaf Acquisition, the Company entered into leases for grow facilities and dispensaries. These leases were determined
to be operating leases under ASC 842, and such leases were capitalized. It was determined that the Tejon lease, due to the short-term
nature of the lease, met the criteria of ASC 842-20-25-2, and as such, it was not necessary to capitalize the lease, and rent would be
recognized on a straight-line basis. 

The
Company records the lease asset and lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The leases typically
do not provide an implicit rate; therefore, the Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate at the time of lease commencement
to discount the present value of lease payments. The Company s discount rate for operating leases at December 31, 2022 was 12.5 .
Leases often include rental escalation clauses, renewal options and/or termination options that are factored into the determination of
lease payments when appropriate. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term to the extent that collection
is considered probable. As a result, the Company has been recognizing rents as they become payable. 

As of December 31,
2022, the aggregate remaining annual lease payments of operating leases liabilities are as follows:

 Present value of future minimum lease payments

As
of December 31, 2022, the aggregate remaining minimal annual lease payments under these operating leases were as follows: 

Total 

Net Loss Per Share 

Basic net loss per share is computed by
dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net loss per share
is computed similarly to basic loss per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities
are exercised. 

Outstanding stock options and common stock
warrants are considered anti-dilutive because we are in a net loss position. Accordingly, the number of weighted average shares outstanding
for basic and fully diluted net loss per share are the same. 

The following summarizes equity instruments
that may, in the future, have a dilutive effect on earnings per share:

The Company
determined that it is not more likely than not that its deferred tax asset would be realizable, accordingly, the Company recorded a valuation
allowance for the full amount of its deferred tax asset, resulting in a zero carrying value of the Company s deferred tax asset
and no benefit from or provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Federal and state operating loss carry

9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

On
June 24, 2022, the Company dismissed Macias Gini O Connell MGO as its independent registered public accounting
firm to audit the Company's financial statements. MGO s reports on the Company's financial statements for the past two years, and
any subsequent interim period through the date of dismissal, did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, or was qualified
or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of MGO, would have caused MGO to make reference to such
disagreement in its report. During the two most recent fiscal years, and any subsequent interim period through the date of dismissal,
were no disagreements with MGO or certain other reportable events. 

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We
carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022,
the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses discussed
below. 

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer and effected by the Board, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and
includes those policies and procedures that: 

o 
 pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets. 

o 
 provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures of are being made only in accordance with authorizations
 of our management and directors; and, 

o 
 provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of our inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
identified the following material weaknesses: 

o 
 we
 do not have an Audit Committee While not being legally obligated to have an Audit Committee, it is the management s
 view that such a committee, including a financial expert board member, is an utmost important entity level control of the Company s
 financial statements. Currently, the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee and does not include a member
 that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities. 

o 
 we
 have not performed a risk assessment and mapped our processes to control objectives. 

o 
 we
 have not implemented comprehensive entity-level internal controls. 

o 
 we
 have not implemented adequate system and manual controls; and 

o 
 we
 do not have sufficient segregation of duties. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission COSO in
Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on management s assessment, management concluded that the above material
weaknesses have not been remediated and, accordingly, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as of December 31,
2022. 

Remediation
of Material Weaknesses 

We
have designed and plan to implement, or in some cases have already implemented, the specific remediation initiatives described below: 

42 

o 
 We
 intend to allocate resources to perform a risk assessment and map processes to control objectives and, where necessary, implement
 and document internal controls in accordance with COSO. 

o 
 Our
 entity-level controls are, generally, informal and we intend to evaluate current processes, supplement where necessary, and document
 requirements. 

o 
 While
 we have implemented procedures to identify, evaluate and record significant transactions, we need to formally document these procedures
 and evidence the performance of the related controls. 

o 
 We
 plan to evaluate system and manual controls, identify specific weaknesses, and implement a comprehensive system of internal controls. 

Management
understands that in order to remediate the material weaknesses, additional segregation of duties, changes in personnel and technologies
are necessary. We will not consider these material weaknesses fully remediated until management has tested those internal controls and
found them to be operating effectively. 

This
Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to such attestation pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
that permits us to provide only management s report in this Annual Report.
