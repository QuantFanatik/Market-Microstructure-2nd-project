ITEM 1
 BUSINESS 

Overview 

We
conduct our business primarily through Beijing Kezhao and its subsidiaries, which serve as high-tech business operational managers and
M A integration growth. Beijing Kezhao is committed to developing high-end manufacturing, adhering to the extension of advanced materials
to new materials and other fields, helping the manufacturing industry to continuously update and iterate, and helping scientific and
technological enterprises develop into high-tech enterprises. At the same time, explore global scientific and technological information,
scientific and technological talents and scientific and technological enterprises in various fields, dynamically evaluate the value of
scientific and technological entities in multiple dimensions, constantly create a good entrepreneurial format, and incubate more high-quality
and high potential enterprises. We conduct business through Beijing Kezhao and its subsidiaries, which act as high-tech business operation
managers and M A integration growth. 

Since
its inception, the Company strategically planned its layout and network coverage. Our asset management layout covers 4 core strategic
areas including Bohai economic rim, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, Cheng-Yu economic circle, in which we have established more
than 20 asset management affiliates which mainly distribute in 7 economically vibrant core cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen,
Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Chengdu. 

We
started to increase our sales and promotional activities and efforts in line with the expansion of our business and fund offerings. The
steady growing allocation of resources to our fund sales and promotional activities, including hiring additional sales and marketing
employees in line with the overall growth of our business, has significantly strengthened our business development and brand recognition. 

Risk
Control Procedures 

The
Company has set up a risk management and control division and a risk control system that covers every link of the business and allows
the group to have real-time updates of credit risks, market risks, operational risks and reputational risks commonly seen in the industry,
and based on regulatory requirements, business rules and regulations, to conduct compliance evaluation of products and projects and implement
strict scrutiny, putting risk control measures in place during product innovation and later-stage management in terms of business requirements
and technological realization. 

Information disclosure
 is a key element of our operational risk control. In order to maintain information transparency, we regularly publish the quarterly,
 semi-annual and annual reports of the products performance. 

External surveillance is
 a crucial part of the ethical risk control. We have maintained in-depth communication and negotiation with custodian banks and professional
 agencies. In February 2011, we held several talks with the Agriculture Bank of China, Suzhou Branch on the custody of funds,
 and entered into a final custody agreement with it. In March 2011, we met with our funds auditor Ernst Young Hua Ming
 CPAs Co., Ltd. and established the funds financial reports submission procedures. In the meanwhile, we also engaged law firms
 to provide legal counseling on funds related matters and general corporate matters. 

Our project risk management
 starts with early-stage control. We examine the agreements and focus on the buy-back and protective provisions. The intermediate-stage
 control deploys directors and supervisors to the target organization. The final-stage control is post-investment. The Company reassess
 project risks promptly. The Company has established partners conference, investment decision-making committee, strategic advisory
 committee.

IT
Infrastructure

currently use OA, CRM, and Wealth Cloud as IT infrastructure to sell our products. IT infrastructure is an important component of our
business operations, which supports our client relationship management and product research and development. We plan to continue to invest
in our IT infrastructure by adding new features and functionalities and by improving existing software and IT modules. We expect that
our improved IT infrastructure and more advanced platform will enable us to scale up our business and maintain consistent service quality
as we further expand our coverage network and client base. 

Legal
Proceedings 

We
may from time to time be involved in litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of our business. Our businesses are also subject
to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. 

We
are not currently subject to any pending judicial, administrative or arbitration proceedings that we expect would have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations.

Taxation 

Our
company, our subsidiaries, and our consolidated VIE file tax returns separately. 

1)
Value added tax VAT 

Pursuant
to the Provisional Regulation of the PRC on VAT and the related implementing rules, all entities and individuals taxpayers that are engaged in the modern service industry in the PRC are generally required to pay VAT at a rate of 6 of the gross sales proceeds
received, less any deductible VAT already paid or borne by the taxpayers. Our PRC subsidiary and our consolidated VIE are subject to
VAT at 6 of their revenues. 

2)
Income tax 

Cayman
Islands 

The
Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on the Company based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation. In addition, payments of dividends
that we make to our shareholders are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands. 

Hong
Kong 

Kesheng
HK, which was incorporated in Hong Kong, is subject to a corporate income tax rate of 16.5 . 

PRC 

Our
subsidiary and the consolidated VIE established in the PRC are subject to the PRC statutory income tax rate of 25 , according to the
PRC Enterprise Income Tax EIT law. 

The
current PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law imposes a 10 withholding income tax for dividends distributed by foreign invested enterprises
to their immediate holding companies outside the PRC. A lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement
between the PRC and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. Distributions to holding companies in Hong Kong that satisfy certain
requirements specified by PRC tax authorities, for example, will be subject to a 5 withholding tax rate. 

6 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
manage our liquidity and capital requirements by focusing on our cash flows before the consolidation of our funds a and the effect of
changes in short term assets and liabilities, which we anticipate will be settled for cash within one year. Our primary cash flow activities
typically involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities, by investing in investments
that generate yield (namely interest and dividends) as well as the sale of investments and other assets;; (iiii) developing and funding
new investment strategies, investment products and other growth initiatives, including acquisitions of other investments, assets and
businesses; (iv) distributing cash flow to our unitholders; and (v) paying borrowings, interest payments and repayments under borrowing
arrangements. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Prior
to this offering, we have been a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources to address our internal control
over financial reporting. In connection with the preparation and external audit of our consolidated financial statements, we and our
independent registered public accounting firm identified one material weakness and certain other control deficiencies in our internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The material weakness identified was the lack of dedicated resources to
take responsibility for the finance and accounting functions and the preparation of financial statements in compliance with U.S. GAAP.
Neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm undertook a comprehensive assessment of our internal control under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for purposes of identifying and reporting any weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial
reporting, as they may be required to do once we become a public company and our independent registered public accounting firm may be
required to do once we cease to be an emerging growth company. Had we performed a formal assessment of our internal control over financial
reporting or had our independent registered public accounting firm performed an audit of our internal control over financial reporting,
additional control deficiencies may have been identified. 

To
improve our internal control over financial reporting, some steps that we have already taken to remediate the material weakness identified.
We plan to hire additional qualified financial and accounting staff with working experience of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements.
We have also established clear roles and responsibilities for accounting and financial reporting staff to address complex accounting
and financial reporting issues. Furthermore, we will continue to further expedite and streamline our reporting process and develop our
compliance process, including establishing a comprehensive policy and procedure manual, to allow early detection, prevention and resolution
of potential compliance issues, and establishing an ongoing program to provide sufficient and appropriate training for financial reporting
and accounting personnel, especially training related to U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. We intend to conduct regular and continuous
U.S. GAAP accounting and financial reporting programs and send our financial staff to attend external U.S. GAAP training courses. 

We
also intend to hire additional resources to strengthen the financial reporting function and set up a financial and system control framework.
We expect that we will incur significant costs in the implementation of such measures. However, the implementation of these measures
may not fully address the deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. We are not able to estimate with reasonable
certainty the costs that we will need to incur to implement these and other measures designed to improve our internal control over financial
reporting. The process of designing and implementing an effective financial reporting system is a continuous effort that requires us
to anticipate and react to changes in our business and economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain
a financial reporting system that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations. See Risk Factors Risks Related to
Our Business and Industry If we fail to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability
to accurately report our financial results may be impaired, which could adversely impact investor confidence and the market price of
our ordinary shares. 

As
a company with less than 1.07 billion in revenue for our last fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth company pursuant
to the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise
applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include exemption from the auditor attestation requirement under Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in the assessment of the emerging growth company s internal control over financial reporting. 

7 

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 

We
are exposed to market risks, which include interest rate changes in United States of America and commodity prices. We do not engage in
financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of
fees, expenses and investment income. Our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience
and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are
often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately
different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which
the actual amounts become known. We believe our critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if
we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions. 

The
following discussion details certain of our critical accounting policies.

value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date under current market conditions. Except for our certain equity method investments and debt obligations, our investments
and other financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts whose carrying values approximate fair value. Where available,
fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs
are not available, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve varying levels of management estimation and judgment,
the degree of which is dependent on a variety of factors. 

GAAP
establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring
financial instruments at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument,
the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of
transactions between market participants. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices in active markets generally will
have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. 

Recognition
of Investment Income 

Investment
income consists primarily of the net impact of: (i) realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, (ii) dividends, (iii) interest
income, (iv) interest expense and (v) foreign exchange gains and losses relating to mark-to-market activity on foreign exchange forward
contracts, foreign currency options, foreign denominated debt and debt securities issued by consolidated CFEs. Unrealized gains or losses
resulting from the aforementioned activities are included in net gains (losses) from investment activities. Upon disposition of an instrument
that is marked-to-market, previously recognized unrealized gains or losses are reversed and a realized gain or loss is recognized. While
this reversal generally does not significantly impact the net amounts of gains (losses) that we recognize from investment activities,
it affects the manner in which we classify our gains and losses for reporting purposes. 

Certain
of our investment funds are consolidated. When a fund is consolidated, the portion of our funds investment income that is allocable
to our carried interests and capital investments is not shown in the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 8A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange
Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our senior management, consisting of David Lazar, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer and
Secretary (Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, consisting of David Lazar, Chief
Executive Officer, Secretary and Treasurer (Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer) of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure
controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting, David Lazar,
Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer and Secretary (Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer) concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under
the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board, management and other personnel,
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and
procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
 made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

9 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed,
have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent
limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to
reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of independent directors on our
Board, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate
segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting
processes. 

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However,
management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of independent directors on our Board results in ineffective
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement
in our financial statements in future periods. 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated,
or plan to initiate, the following series of measures: 

Assuming
we are able to secure additional working capital, we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and
will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us. 

We
also plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our Board who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning
audit committee which will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such
as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management. 

Management
believes that the appointment of one or more independent directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will
remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of independent directors on our Board. 

We
anticipate that these initiatives will be implemented in conjunction with the growth of our business. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, that occurred during our fourth quarter
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Director and shareholders of KB Global Holdings Limited 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of KB Global Holdings Limited and Subsidiaries (collectively, the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive losses, shareholders 
equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.
