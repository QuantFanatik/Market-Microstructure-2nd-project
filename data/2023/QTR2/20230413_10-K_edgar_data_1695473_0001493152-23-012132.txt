performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed
or implied by any forward-looking statements. 

Important
factors that may cause the actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements, projections or other expectations include, but
are not limited to, the following: 

risk
 that we will not be able to remediate identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure
 controls and procedures;

 that we fail to meet the requirements of the agreements under which we acquired our business interests, including any cash payments
 to the business operations, which could result in the loss of our right to continue to operate or develop the specific businesses
 described in the agreements; 

risk
 that we will be unable to secure additional financing in the near future in order to commence and sustain our planned development
 and growth plans; 

risk
 that we cannot attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, particularly employees, consultants and contractors for our operations; 

risks
 and uncertainties relating to the various industries and operations we are currently engaged in; 

results
 of initial feasibility, pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, and the possibility that future growth, development or expansion
 will not be consistent with our expectations; 

risks
 related to the inherent uncertainty of business operations including profit, cost of goods, production costs and cost estimates and
 the potential for unexpected costs and expenses; 

risks
 related to commodity price fluctuations; 

the
 uncertainty of profitability based upon our history of losses; 

risks
 related to failure to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis and on acceptable terms for our planned development projects; 

risks
 related to environmental regulation and liability; 

risks
 related to tax assessments;

of activity, performance or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as

PART

1. BUSINESS 

HISTORY
OF OUR COMPANY 

The
Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. (the Company was formed in March 2014 as a limited liability company under the name, The
Greater Cannabis Company, LLC. The Company remained a wholly owned subsidiary of Sylios Corp until March 2017. The Company s initial
business plan was to concentrate on cannabis related investment and development opportunities through its online retail store, direct
equity investments, joint ventures, licensing agreements or acquisitions. Our current operations are focused on our online store, GCC
Superstore. 

On
July 31, 2018, the Company entered into and consummated a voluntary share exchange transaction with Green C Corporation, a company incorporated
under the laws of the Province of Ontario Green C and the shareholders of Green C (the Selling Shareholders pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement by and among the Company, Green C and the Selling Shareholders (the Exchange Agreement ). 

In
accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Company issued 9,411,998 shares of its preferred stock, par value 0.001 (the
 Shares to the Selling Shareholders and certain individuals named below (collectively, the Shareholder Group in exchange for 100 of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Green C (the Exchange Transaction ). As a result of
the Exchange Transaction, the Selling Shareholders acquired 29.67 of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of preferred
stock, Green C became the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary and the Company acquired 100 of the business and operations of Green
C. 

After
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, we switched our business model in fiscal 2018 and no longer
intended to pursue E-commerce, advertising, licensing (except as specified below) or direct investment operations. We are now engaged
in the development and commercialization of innovative cannabinoid therapeutics using our proprietary delivery system. Our mission is
to bring our products to the global market through partnerships with leading cannabis and pharmaceutical companies, for the benefit of
patients and consumers. 

From
July 2018 through mid-2021, Greater Cannabis focused on commercializing its own and licensed technologies worldwide for transmucosal
and transdermal delivery of legal medical or recreational cannabis (other than in the field of oral care) and cannabinoids CBD (. While part of the cannabis family, CBD, which contains less than 0.3 tetrahydrocannabinol THC ), the psychoactive compound
that produces the high in marijuana, is distinguished from cannabis by its use, physical appearance and lower THC concentration
(cannabis generally has a THC level of 10 or more). The Company s initial product was an oral transmucosal patch platform which
provides for loaded actives to be absorbed by the buccal mucosa into the body. Although the Company was able to launch the product and
received some limited initial orders, Greater Cannabis management ultimately elected to pursue other opportunities, which they believed
offered the Company greater potential for growth and ultimate profitability. 

Accordingly,
on October 19, 2021 the Company entered into a license agreement with Shaare Zedek Scientific Ltd. SZS ), the technology
transfer arm of Jerusalem s Shaare Zedek Medical Center (SZMC). The license agreement covers the license of SZS s novel cannabinoid
therapeutic focused on treatment of autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson s disease, Alzheimer s disease and other neuropsychiatric
disorders. Shaare Zedek Medical Center, founded in 1901, is one of the largest multidisciplinary research hospitals in Israel with 1,000
beds and over 850,000 patient visits a year. The SZMC Center for Research and Development has over 300 annual publications of investigator
initiated studies in medical journals in addition to almost 160 clinical trials. 

Accompanying
the license agreement is a joint research and development agreement, which will focus on continuing the clinical program spearheaded
by Dr. Adi Aran, M.D., Director of Pediatric Neurology at SZMC, Board Member of the Israeli Society for Pediatric Neurology, and co-inventor
of the novel cannabinoid therapy. Dr. Aran is a world renowned expert in cannabis research and pediatric neurology and was the principal
investigator of the first ever cannabis research study conducted on autistic children. 

Dr.
Aran s pioneering study assessed safety, tolerability and efficacy of CBD based medical cannabis as an adjuvant therapy for refractory
behavioral problems in children with ASD. The results provided very compelling evidence that medical cannabis is an effective therapy
for children on the autism spectrum. Conditions in 80 of the children improved, with 62 of parents reporting substantial improvements.
Half of the children had improved communication and 40 reported a decrease in anxiety. The same children had not shown improvement with
conventional drug therapies. Dr. Aran and his team have now developed a novel combination therapy that is believed to be significantly
more effective than the cannabis-only formulation that had been used in the aforementioned study. The Company will continue to further
develop this therapeutic and conduct clinical studies to further substantiate its safety and efficacy beginning in neuropsychiatric disorders. 

The
clinical studies of the therapeutic are expected to require an investment of up to 1,000,000 and up to two years to finalize. 

The
Company s business plan is to (i) conduct clinical studies on and commercialize the cannabinoid-based therapeutic and (ii) concentrate
on cannabis related investment and development opportunities through direct equity investments, joint ventures, licensing agreements
or acquisitions. 

Our
principal executive office is located at The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc., 2833 Smith Avenue Suite 333, Baltimore, MD 21209, and our
telephone number is (443) 738-4051. 

Competition 

There
are a number of other companies operating in the cannabis space. Such companies range from producers of cannabis plants to makers of
cannabis-based edible products to developers of different methods of cannabis delivery. Known competitors in our space include Jazz Pharmaceuticals
(NASDAQ: JAZZ) and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ZYNE).

Research
and Development 

The
Company is involved in additional research and development of innovative cannabinoid based therapeutics. The Company expects to develop
new formulations around cannabinoid therapeutics and intends to file more patents to protect the intellectual property resulting from
that R D. To support these efforts, the Company will allocate additional funds of approximately 250,000 from financing proceeds
to research and development, sample productions and preclinical studies. 

Government
Regulation 

Cannabis
is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act CSA and is, therefore, illegal under
federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession or cultivation
remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in
the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice
(the DOJ defines Schedule I controlled substances as the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially
severe psychological or physical dependence. If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA in Colorado with respect to
cannabis, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines
and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a 50 million fine. 

Notwithstanding
the CSA, as of the date of this filing, 33 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Guam and Puerto Rico allow
their residents to use medical cannabis and 11 states have legalized recreational marijuana. Such state and territorial laws are in conflict
with the federal CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal at the federal level. 

In
light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration under President Obama had
effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully
abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. For example, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General
of the Obama administration, James M. Cole, issued a memorandum (the Cole Memo to all United States Attorneys providing
updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA (see -The Cole Memo ). In addition,
the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN provided guidelines (the FinCEN Guidelines on February
14, 2014, regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy
Act obligations).

Cole
Memo 

Because
of the discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from
federal law that prohibits any such activities, DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued the Cole Memo concerning cannabis enforcement
under the CSA. The Cole Memo guidance applies to all of the DOJ s federal enforcement activity, including civil enforcement and
criminal investigations and prosecutions, concerning cannabis in all states. 

The
Cole Memo reiterates Congress s determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis
is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo
notes that the DOJ is committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also notes that the DOJ is committed
to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and
rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provides guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their
enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities
(the Enforcement Priorities in preventing: 

the
 distribution of cannabis to minors; 

revenue
 from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels; 

the
 diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; 

state-authorized
 cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 

violence
 and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; 

drugged
 driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use; 

the
 growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public
 lands; and 

cannabis
 possession or use on federal property. 

4 

We
intend to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in and ensure that our activities do
not interfere with any of the Enforcement Priorities set forth in the Cole Memo. 

The
Cole Memo is meant only as a guide for United States Attorneys and does not alter in any way the Department of Justice s authority
to enforce Federal law, including Federal laws relating to cannabis, regardless of state law. 

Agriculture
Improvement Act of 2018 

The
federal Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, signed into law on December 20, 2018, along with the Agricultural Act of 2014, the corresponding
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 provisions (as extended by resolution into 2018) and related state law, provide for the cultivation,
processing, manufacturing and sale of hemp-derived products, as part of agricultural pilot programs and/or state plans adopted by individual
states, including Colorado. However, there can be no assurance that new legislation or regulations may be introduced at either the federal
and/or state level which, if passed, would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on the manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising
and distribution and sale of hemp-derived products. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation, elimination or relabeling
of certain products to meet new standards and revisions to certain sales and marketing materials and it is possible that the costs of
complying with these new regulatory requirements could be material. 

FDA 

The
use of our technology may be subject to pre-approval by the FDA for certain applications, or equivalent regulatory body approval in other
jurisdictions. If so, obtaining FDA and other approvals will require a substantial investment of funds and may take years. In such case,
we intend to rely on our sublicensees or strategic partners to fund and undertake any required approval process. There is no assurance
that we will be able to successfully obtain any such required regulatory approvals needed to enter certain markets or market our technology
for certain applications. 

We
also may be required to comply with FDA and other federal, state and foreign regulations regarding safety, dosing and other similar matters. 

Employees 

We
have one person providing us services on a full-time basis, our chief executive officer.

5. MARKET FOR COMPANY S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. 

Market
Information 

Our
shares of common stock have been quoted on the OTCQB tier of the over-the-counter market operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. under the
symbol GCAN since August 2018. Such market is extremely limited. We can provide no assurance that our shares of common
stock will be continued to be quoted on the OTC or another exchange, or if traded, that the current public market will be sustainable. 

Holders
of Record 

On
the date of this annual report, there were 337 holders of record of our common stock, as reported by the Company s transfer agent.
In computing the number of holders of record, each broker-dealer and clearing corporation holding shares on behalf of its customers is
counted as a single stockholder and accordingly, the Company believes that the number of beneficial owners of its common stock is significantly
higher. 

Dividends 

We
have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock nor do we anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future. Furthermore,
we expect to retain any future earnings to finance our operations and expansion. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be
at the discretion of our Board of Directors.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
SEC issued Financial Reporting Release No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies 
suggesting that companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies. In Financial Reporting
Release No. 60, the SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s
financial condition and operating results and require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result
of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the following significant
policies as critical to the understanding of our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make a variety of estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and (ii) the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods covered by the financial statements. Our management expects to
make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting
the future resolution of the uncertainties increase, these judgments become even more subjective and complex. Although we believe that
our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in estimates and
assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that are material to investors.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. the Company as of December 31, 2022, the
related statements of operations, stockholder s deficit, and cash flows, for the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Material
Uncertainty Relating to Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern as disclosed in Note 3 to
the financial statement, the Company has continuously incurred a net loss of (360,268) for the year ended December 31, 2022, working
capital deficit of (555,247) and an accumulated deficit of (4,292,902) as at December 31, 2022. The continuation of the Company as a
going concern through December 31, 2022, is dependent upon improving the profitability and the continuing financial support from its
stockholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide additional cash to meet the Company s
obligations as they become due. 

These
factors raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required
to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required
to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

 NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 For
the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 

of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock of Green C Corporation Green
C in exchange for newly issued shares of the Company s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Exchange ).
 shares of common stock and is entitled to vote 50 votes per
share on all matters as a class with holders of common stock . Since after the Exchange was consummated, the former shareholders of Green
C and their designees owned approximately of the issued and outstanding voting shares of the Company, Green C is the acquirer for
accounting purposes. Prior to the Exchange, the Company had no assets and nominal business operations. Accordingly, the Exchange has
been treated for accounting purposes as a recapitalization by the accounting acquirer, Green C, and the accompanying consolidated financial
statements of the Company reflect the assets, liabilities and operations of Green C from its inception on December 21, 2017 to July 31,
2018 and combined with the Company thereafter. 

Green
C was incorporated on December 21, 2017 under the laws of the Province of Ontario Canada with its principal place of business in North
York, Ontario. 

Green
C was the owner of an exclusive, worldwide license for an eluting transmucosal patch platform ETP for non-invasive drug
delivery in the cannabis field as further described in the exclusive license agreement dated June 21, 2018 with Pharmedica Ltd. (see
Note J). 

After
the consummation of the above-described transactions, the Company switched its business model in fiscal 2018 and no longer intended to
pursue E-commerce, advertising, licensing (except as specified below) or direct investment operations. Instead, the Company is now engaged
in the development and commercialization of innovative cannabinoid therapeutics. 

From
July 2018 through mid-2021, the Company focused on commercializing its own and licensed technologies worldwide for transmucosal and transdermal
delivery of legal medical or recreational cannabis (other than in the field of oral care) and cannabinoids. The Company s initial
product was an oral transmucosal patch platform which provides for loaded actives to be absorbed by the buccal mucosa into the body.
Although the Company was able to launch the product and received some limited initial orders, the Company s management ultimately
elected to pursue other opportunities which they believed offered the Company greater potential for growth and ultimate profitability. 

Accordingly,
on October 19, 2021 the Company entered into a license agreement with Shaare Zedek Scientific Ltd. SZS ), the technology
transfer arm of Jerusalem s Shaare Zedek Medical Center (SZMC). The license agreement covers the license of SZS s novel cannabinoid
therapeutic focused on treatment of autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson s disease, Alzheimer s disease and other neuropsychiatric
disorders. 

Accompanying
the license agreement is a joint research and development agreement, which will focus on continuing the clinical program spearheaded
by Dr. Adi Aran, M.D. Director of Pediatric Neurology at SZMC, Board Member of the Israeli Society for Pediatric Neurology, and co-inventor
of the novel cannabinoid therapy.

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives
and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) . This ASU reduces the number of accounting models
for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. As well as amend the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for
contracts in an entity s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. In addition, this ASU improves
and amends the related EPS guidance. This standard is effective for us on July 1, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. Adoption is either a modified retrospective method or a fully retrospective method of transition. We are currently evaluating
the impact of the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on our financial statements. 

On
July 13, 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2017-11. Among
other things, ASU 2017-11 provides guidance that eliminates the requirement to consider down round features when determining
whether certain financial instruments or embedded features are indexed to an entity s stock and need to be classified as liabilities.
ASU 2017-11 provides for entities to recognize the effect of a down round feature only when it is triggered and then as a dividend and
a reduction to income available to common stockholders in basic earnings per share. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2018. 

NOTE
A NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations,
to clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and address how an entity should assess whether it is
the principal or the agent in contracts that include three or more parties. The effective date and transition requirements for these
amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09 (discussed above). ASU 2016-08 has had no impact
on our Financial statements for the periods presented. 

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing, to clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: 1) identifying performance obligations, and 2) the licensing implementation
guidance. The effective date and transition requirements for these amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements
of ASU 2014-09 (discussed above). ASU 2016-10 has had no impact on our financial statements for the periods presented.

, total current liabilities
of , and negative working capital of . For the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred a net loss of and used
 cash from operating activities. We expect to continue to incur negative cash flows until such time as our business generates
sufficient cash inflows to finance our operations and debt service requirements. 

In
performing the second step of this assessment, we are required to evaluate whether our plans to mitigate the conditions above alleviate
the substantial doubt about our ability to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial
statements are issued. Our future plans include securing additional funding sources. 

There
is no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will
be available through external sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations
or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore,
have a material effect on the business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available
on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company s existing shareholders. We have therefore
concluded there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through March 2024. 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a going concern.

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, Aitan Zacharin, who is our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, as of December 31, 2018, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under
Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our chief
executive officer has concluded that, based on the material weaknesses discussed below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities
Exchange Act were recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Act
Commission s rules and forms and that our disclosure controls are not effectively designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our chief executive officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of,
Aitan Zacharin, the Company s chief executive officer, and effected by the Company s board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. 

The
Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of the Company s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting at December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment
under those criteria, management has determined that, as of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was not
effective. 

Our
internal controls are not effective for the following reasons: (i) there is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control
objectives as management is comprised of only two persons, one of which is the Company s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer and, (ii) the Company does not have an audit committee with a financial expert, and thus the Company lacks the board
oversight role within the financial reporting process. 

In
order to mitigate the foregoing material weakness, we have engaged an outside accounting consultant with significant experience in the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP to assist us in the preparation of our financial statements to ensure that
these financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of this action and make
any changes that our management deems appropriate. 

We
would need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently, it is not feasible to hire additional staff
to obtain optimal segregation of duties. Management will continue to reassess this matter to determine whether improvement in segregation
of duty is feasible. In addition, we would need to expand our board to include independent members. 

Going
forward, we intend to evaluate our processes and procedures and, where practicable and resources permit, implement changes in order to
have more effective controls over financial reporting. 

This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant
to the exemption provided to issuers that are not large accelerated filers nor accelerated filers under the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 

Changes
in Internal Controls 

During
the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, there was no change in internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected
or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

Professional
History of Aitan Zacharin 

Mr. Zacharin is an experienced executive with broad knowledge in building and managing technology,
biopharmaceutical, healthcare and consumer products businesses. Mr. Zacharin has founded a number of companies, and has seen them through
successful listings in the public markets, with collective valuations of over 1 billion. Mr. Zacharin has been advising and investing
in early to mid-stage startups, and assisting them with development, capitalization, accelerating growth, and turnaround strategies. He
specializes in strategic acquisitions, structuring complex transactions, reverse mergers, and brings domestic and international experience
in operations, accounting, audit preparation, due diligence, capital raising and restructuring, debt financing, and mergers and acquisitions.
In 2012 he co-founded Fuse Science, an innovative biotechnology company and was responsible for growth of the business from its conceptual
stage to a publicly traded CPG and biotech business with multiple subsidiaries. He structured pivotal deals with key partners, which led
to the company successfully raising over 20 million to commercialize its products, including brand ambassador agreements with 26 sports
celebrities, including world renowned athlete Tiger Woods. He successfully exited from the company, which had reached a 110 million valuation.
In 2014, Mr. Zacharin was appointed to the Board of Directors for Mediconecta, the largest telehealth Company in Latin America serving
millions of patients with on-demand, high quality healthcare. Within six months, Mr. Zacharin facilitated and negotiated an eight figure
buyout offer from Teladoc (NASDAQ: TDOC), the world s largest telehealth company, just prior to its IPO. In 2015, Mr. Zacharin became
the managing partner of Secure Hosting LLC, a blockchain mining company with a co-location mining farm in North Carolina. After two years
of scaling out the operations to nearly 15,000,000 in assets, he successfully structured the sale of the company to a leading publicly
traded blockchain mining company. In 2017, Mr. Zacharin founded GCANRx (OTC: GCAN), a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company focused
on repurposing a highly bioavailable transmucosal drug delivery system that had previously been commercialized in partnership with Novartis.
Mr. Zacharin repurposed the platform technology for use in cannabinoid therapeutics. He then negotiated a worldwide exclusive license
from Shaare Zedek Scientific, the licensing arm of one of Israel s largest research hospitals, for a cannabinoid-based therapeutic
used in treating neuropsychiatric disorders. The therapeutic was invented by world-renowned cannabis researcher, Dr. Adi Aran, M.D. The
Company is currently in the final stages of regulatory approval for a 100 patient Phase 2 clinical study for the treatment of autism related
spectrum disorders. In 2018, Mr. Zacharin became a shareholder in sports technology company, Slinger (NASDAQ: CNXA). The company manufactures
an innovative, patented sports product called the Slinger Bag, which raised 1 million through a highly successful Kickstarter campaign.
Mr. Zacharin was tasked by the founder to take the company public. The Company was led by the past- CEO of global tennis company Prince.
Within the first 18 months of operations the company grew to a global footprint of 65 countries, signed 250 million in distribution agreements,
and achieved a market cap of over 400 million. Throughout the growth of the company, Mr. Zacharin served as the head of investor relations
and was instrumental in raising the company over 27 million from leading Wall Street investors, and overseeing the IR strategy, which
led to the stock rising over 1,700 from its listing price. Mr. Zacharin was actively involved in Slinger s acquisition of three
companies, most notably a Softbank and Verizon Ventures backed artificial intelligence sports company for 100 million. Mr. Zacharin led
the effort of putting together a team, which successfully uplisted the Company from the OTC Markets to the Nasdaq. In 2019, Mr. Zacharin
joined an investor group who acquired Solstice Sunglasses, the second largest sunglasses retailer in the US, to list the company s shares
on the public markets. Mr. Zacharin led the merger of Solstice with a public vehicle, which enabled a multi-million dollar round of financing
for the retailer. In 2020, Mr. Zacharin identified, structured and facilitated the acquisition of a luxury, multi-state substance abuse
facility. Mr. Zacharin secured financing for the 18 million acquisition with a combination of investments from high net worth individuals
and a loan facility from a speciality banking lender. The company subsequently purchased two additional drug rehab portfolios, and grew
to become a leading multi-state operator in the drug rehabilitation industry. In 2021, Mr. Zacharin became the co-founder and CEO of PlasmaCure,
a groundbreaking medical device company focused on R D and commercialization of an oncology treatment licensed from GW University.
Mr. Zacharin holds dual degrees from the University of South Florida. He serves in an executive capacity to two publicly listed companies,
and maintains various board non-profit board appointments.

Audit
Committee and Financial Expert 

We
do not have an audit committee or an audit committee financial expert. Our corporate financial affairs are simple at this stage of development
and each financial transaction can be viewed by any officer or Director at will. We will form an audit committee if it becomes necessary
as a result of growth of the Company or as mandated by public policy. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
do currently have a Code of Ethics applicable to our principal executive, financial and accounting officers. 

Potential
Conflicts of Interest 

Since
we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent Directors, the functions that would have been performed by
such committees are performed by our Board of Directors. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest, in that our Directors who are
also our officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation, and audit issues that may affect management
decisions. We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our Directors or officers.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficiency, and cash flows for the
year ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
B to the financial statements, the Company has negative cash from operations, negative working capital, and historical net losses. These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard
to these matters are also described in Note B. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Derivatives
on Convertible Loans (Note G to the financial statements) 

Derivatives
associated with conversion features embedded in promissory notes are required to be assessed a fair value at inception, and subsequent
period ends, using an appropriate valuation model. The Company uses Black Scholes Merton (BSM) model in assessing the fair value of derivatives. 

Auditing
management s valuation of derivatives was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimates and assumptions that are
used as inputs in the valuation model. These fair value estimates are highly sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions. 

How
the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

Our
audit procedures related to testing the Company s valuation of derivatives included the following, among others: 

We
 calculated an internal estimate of the fair value of derivatives transactions during the
 year and compared to the valuation provided by the Company. 

We
 reviewed the inputs used in the Company s valuation model and traced that information
 out to underlying documentation and publicly available information in determining those inputs
 were reasonable. 

We
 reviewed executed and outstanding promissory notes and equity securities for conversion features
 that had not been considered for derivative accounting, noting no unrecorded derivatives. 

We
 have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.
