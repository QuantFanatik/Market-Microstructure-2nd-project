Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Diligent Capital Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders (deficit)/equity and cash flows for the year then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, although the Company has limited operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /S/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

Rights and Provisions of said preferred shares will be determined at a later date; prior to issuance. F-7 Table of Contents Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. PLAN OF OPERATION The Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire or merge with a Target Business. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict our potential candidate Target Businesses to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. The Company does not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. The costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be paid with additional capital contributed by SX, our sole stockholder. During the next 12 months, we anticipate incurring costs related to: (i) filing of Exchange Act reports, and (ii) investigating, analyzing and consummating an acquisition. We anticipate that these costs may be in the range of ten to fifteen thousand dollars, and that we will be able to meet these costs as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our sole stockholder, SX. We anticipate allocating the entire amount towards the filing of Exchange Act reports. The foregoing notwithstanding, SX has not committed to a maximum amount of financial contribution to the Company. The Company, does not intend to but, may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering. SX is continually in discussion with various entities who are considering mergers and acquisition, however, our management has not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any Target Business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. Our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing, and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another. 4 Table of Contents We anticipate that the consummation of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital that we will have and/or the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2022 revenues were 0. This was attributable to having been formed on February 21, 2022 and the Company s business plan. Cost of Revenue For the three months ended December 31, 2022 Cost of Revenues were 0. This was attributable to having been formed on February 21, 2022 and the Company s business plan. Cash Flow Cash at the end of the year ended December 31, 2022 was 226. A 226 increase from the previous period February 21, 2022 (inception). This was attributable to paid in capital. Officer Compensation Officer Compensation was 0 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Professional Fees Professional Fees were 0 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Selling, General and Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative Expenses were 9,188) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Other Expense Other Expense were 0 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net Loss Net Loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 9,188) Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes total current assets, liabilities and working capital at December 31, 2022. December 31, 2022 Current Assets 226 Current Liabilities 0 Working Capital (Deficit) 226 5 Table of Contents Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We have not utilized any derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts, options and swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts or interest rate swaps and futures. We believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities. We do not have any borrowings and, consequently, we are not affected by changes in market interest rates. We do not currently have any sales or own assets and operate facilities in countries outside the United States and, consequently, we are not effected by foreign currency fluctuations or exchange rate changes. Overall, we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate changes is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. Our Auditors Have Raised Substantial Doubts as to Our Ability to Continue as a Going Concern Our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. The Company has experienced recurring losses from operations which have not caused a deficit as of December 31, 2022. The ability of the Company to continue its operations as a going concern is dependent on management s plans, which include the raising of capital through debt and/or equity markets with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The Company will require additional funding to finance the growth of its current and expected future operations as well as to achieve its strategic objectives. The Company believes its current available cash along with anticipated revenues may be insufficient to meet its cash needs for the near future. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 6 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
