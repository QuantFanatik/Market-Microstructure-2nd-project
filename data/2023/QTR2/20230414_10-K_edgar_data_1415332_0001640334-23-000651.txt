In this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to common shares refer to the common shares in our capital stock. As used in this current report and unless otherwise indicated, the terms we , us and our mean Lithium Corporation, unless otherwise indicated. General Overview We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 30, 2007 under the name Utalk Communications Inc. . At inception, we were a development stage corporation engaged in the business of developing and marketing a call-back service using a call-back platform. Because we were not successful in implementing our business plan, we considered various alternatives to ensure the viability and solvency of our company. On August 31, 2009, we entered into a letter of intent with Nevada Lithium regarding a business combination which may be effected in one of several different ways, including an asset acquisition, merger of our company and Nevada Lithium, or a share exchange whereby we would purchase the shares of Nevada Lithium from its shareholders in exchange for restricted shares of our common stock. Effective September 30, 2009, we effected a 1 old for 60 new forward stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital increased from 50,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of 0.001 to 3,000,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of 0.001 and our issued and outstanding shares increased from 4,470,000 shares of common stock to 268,200,000 shares of common stock. Also effective September 30, 2009, we changed our name from Utalk Communications, Inc. to Lithium Corporation , by way of a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary Lithium Corporation, which was formed solely for the change of name. The name change and forward stock split became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening for trading on October 1, 2009 under the stock symbol LTUM . Our CUSIP number is 536804 107. On October 9, 2009, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Nevada Lithium and the shareholders of Nevada Lithium. The closing of the transactions contemplated in the share exchange agreement and the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock in the capital of Nevada Lithium occurred on October 19, 2009. In accordance with the closing of the share exchange agreement, we issued 12,350,000 shares of our common stock to the former shareholders of Nevada Lithium in exchange for the acquisition, by our company, of all of the 12,350,000 issued and outstanding shares of Nevada Lithium. Also, pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement, a director of our company cancelled 220,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock. Nevada Lithium s corporate status was allowed to lapse and the company s status with the Nevada Secretary of State has been revoked. 3 Table of Contents In June 2009 we optioned the Fish Lake Valley property in Esmeralda County Nevada, and ultimately earned a 100 interest in the property through a combination of exploration expenditures and share issuances. Lithium Corporation performed geophysical, geochemical and drilling work in the area into early 2016 at which time we entered into an agreement with the forerunner of American Lithium Corporation (TSX-V:Li) who could have earned an undivided 80 interest (with the residual 20 interest being purchasable post earn-in) in the property by incurring exploration expenses, making cash and share payments over a period of three years. American Lithium relinquished all interest in the property/option agreement in April 2019. In April 2021 the Company entered into a Letter of Intent with Altura Mining Limited whereby Altura (now Morella Corporation ASX:1MC, OTC-QB: ALTAF) may earn a 60 interest in the property by incurring exploration expenses, and making staged cash and share payments to Lithium Corporation over the next four years. Morella Corporation is the single largest shareholder in Lithium Corporation with over 8 of the Company s common shares, having acquired an interest through a non-brokered private placement in the Company in 2012. In 2010 the Company acquired the San Emidio property through the staking of claims on open Bureau of Land Management administered Federal land in Washoe County Nevada. The company conducted geochemical, geophysical and drilling work over the next several years, and eventually optioned them off to American Lithium Corporation in May 2016 for a combination of exploration work, cash and share payments over the following three years. American Lithium allowed the option to lapse in 2018. In September 2021 Surge Battery Metals (TSX-V: Nili) entered into an option to earn an 80 interest in the property by incurring exploration expenses and making staged cash and share payments over the following five years. Lithium Corporation received notification in August 2022 that Surge was relinquishing all interest in the property. The company conducted a CSAMT geophysical survey on the property in Fall 2022. In June 2013, we purchased a claim in the Sugar Lake area of British Columbia for 250,000 shares of our common stock. Known as the BC Sugar Property this property has expanded and contracted over time as we allowed a number of the less prospective claims to lapse. In January, 2014, we agreed to buy back the shares issued pursuant to the June 2013 agreement for 2,500. After doing considerable work up until spring 2019 all but approximately 203 acres (82.33 Hectares) of claims were allowed to lapse, and the property sat dormant. The market for flake graphite is improving, and the Company s holdings here are currently approximately 203 acres (82.23 hectares), and the company is currently contemplating a work program here this year. Effective April 23, 2014, we entered into an operating agreement with All American Resources, L.L.C and TY Sons Investments Inc. with respect to Summa, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company incorporated on December 12, 2013, wherein we hold 25 , and are active Managing Members . Our company's initial capital contribution to Summa, LLC was 125,000, of which 100,000 was in cash and the balance in services. To date we have contributed an additional 31,700 in cash, and also over the years an indeterminate amount of casual geological expertise to Summa, LLC. In recognition, Summa transferred five urban lots in Tonopah of indeterminate value in 2020, and since Jan 2021 have issued checks to the company for 138,000. The Tonopah property was optioned in early 2020, and the Optionee has earned a 100 interest in the property. Summa still retains a 1 (LTUM s share 0.25 Net Smelter Royalty on the property, as well as other interests around the state of Nevada, including a property in Belmont Nevada that is currently under option to Nevada Silver Corporation. In April of 2016, our Company established a wholly owned subsidiary called Lithium Royalty Corp. The subsidiary was a Nevada Corporation and was the entity through which we had planned to build a portfolio of lithium mineral properties. Also that April Lithium Royalty Corp acquired through staking the North Big Smoky Prospect, a block of placer mineral claims in Nye County Nevada. On May 13, 2016 our wholly owned subsidiary sold 100 of the interest in the North Big Smoky property through a Property Acquisition Agreement with 1069934 Nevada Ltd. ("Purchaser") a private company. Consideration paid to Lithium Royalty Corp. consisted of mainly of 300,000 shares in the "Purchaser Parent", 1069934 B.C. Ltd. By agreement dated September 13, 2017 Lithium Corporation agreed to sell back the shares of 1069934 Nevada Ltd. to San Antone Minerals Corp. and compensation under the agreement was received on November 2, 2017. The North Big Smoky claims were abandoned by the Purchaser in 2017 and recently the Company has re-staked claims in the general area, and optioned the property to Morella Corp (a related company) who conducted geochemical and geophysical work on the claims in 2022. 4 Table of Contents Our Current Business We are an exploration stage mining company engaged in the identification, acquisition, and exploration of metals and minerals with a focus on lithium mineralization on properties located in Nevada, and graphite and other energy metals properties in British Columbia. Our current operational focus is to conduct generative exploration activities in Nevada, and on our titanium/REE and graphite properties, in British Columbia. In April of 2016, our Company established a wholly owned subsidiary called Lithium Royalty Corp. The subsidiary was a Nevada Corporation and was the entity through which we had planned to build a portfolio of lithium mineral properties. Also that April Lithium Royalty Corp acquired through staking the North Big Smoky Prospect, a block of placer mineral claims in Nye County Nevada. On May 13, 2016 our wholly owned subsidiary sold 100 of the interest in the North Big Smoky Property through a Property Acquisition Agreement with 1069934 Nevada Ltd. ("Purchaser") a private company. Consideration paid to Lithium Royalty Corp. consisted of mainly of 300,000 shares in the "Purchaser Parent", 1069934 B.C. Ltd. By agreement dated September 13, 2017 Lithium Corporation agreed to sell back the shares of 1069934 Nevada Ltd. to San Antone Minerals Corp (successor corporation) and the North Big Smoky claims were allowed to lapse. This area was subsequently re-staked by Lithium Corporation in March 2022, and optioned to Morella Corporation, a related company, who have completed Controlled Source Audio-Magnetotelluric (CSAMT) and Sediment Geochemical surveys on the property in 2022. On September 16 th 2021 Lithium Corporation signed an agreement with Surge Battery Metals whereby Surge could have earned an 80 interest in the Company s San Emidio lithium-in-brine prospect in Washoe County Nevada, by paying an initial 50,000 and issuing 200,000 shares of Surge (TSX-V:Nili). Surge had undertaken to make payments of 620,000 in cash and stock over 5 years while incurring expenditures on the property of 1,000,000 over that period. Upon fulfillment of the aforementioned commitments Surge would have been deemed to have earned their undivided 80 interest and could have formed a joint venture with the Company. The Company had optioned this property off before as effective May 3, 2016, our company entered in to an Exploration Earn-In Agreement with 1067323 B.C. Ltd. with respect to our San Emidio property. The terms of the formal agreement were; payment of 100,000, issuance of 300,000 common shares of 1067323 B.C. Ltd., or of the publicly traded company anticipated to result from a Going Public Transaction, and work performed on the property by the Optionee in the amount of 600,000 over the following three years to earn an 80 interest in the property. 1067323 then had a subsequent Earn-In option to purchase Lithium Corporation's remaining 20 working interest within three years of earning the 80 by paying our company a further 1,000,000, at which point our company would retain a 2.5 Net Smelter Royalty, half of which could have been purchased by 1067323 for an additional 1,000,000. 1067323 B.C. Ltd. merged with American Lithium Corp., and the first tranche of cash and shares were issued in June of 2016. The Company waived the work requirement for the first year and received extra shares of American Lithium Corp as consideration for the amendment to the Agreement. In June 2018, the Company received notification that the purchaser was relinquishing any right to earn an interest in the property and, as such, 202,901 was taken into income. During the year-ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a 217,668 allowance for the property which then had a net book value of Nil. Surge Battery Metals completed some geochemical work on the prospect block and gave Lithium Corporation formal notice in Summer 2022 that they were relinquishing all interest in the property. In Fall 2022 the Company completed a Controlled Source Audio- Magnetotelluric (CSAMT) survey on the property, and is currently considering next steps with respect to exploring and developing this property. 5 Table of Contents On April 29, 2021 we signed a Letter Of Intent (LOI) with Altura Mining Limited (now Morella Corporation after a name change) an Australian Lithium explorer and developer and related party, whereby Morella can earn a 60 interest in the Fish Lake Valley lithium-in-brine property in Esmeralda County, Nevada by paying the Company 675,000, issuing the equivalent of 500,000 worth of Morella stock, and expending 2,000,000 of exploration work over the next four years. To date Morella is current with its obligations under the formal agreement ratified on October 12th 2021, having paid the initial 50,000 on signing the LOI, the 100,000 due on signing the formal agreement, and has issued 28,176,951 shares of Morella (1MC:ASX, Altaf:OTC-QB) common stock. On February 16, 2016, Lithium Corp had issued a news release announcing that our company had entered into a letter of intent with 1032701 B.C. Ltd. with respect to our Fish Lake Valley property. On March 10, 2016 we issued a news release announcing the signing of the Fish Lake Valley Earn-In Agreement. The terms of the Earn-In Agreement allowed 1032701 to earn an 80 interest in Fish Lake Valley for payments over three years totaling 300,000 and issuance of 400,000 common shares of the publicly traded company anticipated to result from a Going Public Transaction, and work performed on the property over three years in the amount of 1,100,000. 1032701 then had a Subsequent Earn-In option to purchase Lithium Corporation's remaining 20 working interest within one year of earning the 80 by paying the Company a further 1,000,000, at that point the Company would retain a 2.5 Net Smelter Royalty, half of which could have been purchased by 1032701 for an additional 1,000,000. Menika Mining, a publicly traded company on the TSX Venture Exchange trading under the symbol MML announced on March 8, 2016 that it intended to acquire 1032701 B.C. Ltd and the right to acquire the Fish Lake Valley Property. Menika Mining completed the acquisition of 1032701 B.C. and fulfilled the initial obligations of the Fish Lake Valley Earn-In-Agreement in April of 2016. Meninka later changed their name to American Lithium. While the Purchaser did comply with all terms of the agreement with respect to cash and share payments the Company received formal notice of the relinquishment of the Purchasers right to earn an interest in the property on April 30 th 2019. As this was the termination of the option agreement 443,308 was taken into income. During the year-ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a 159,859 allowance for the properties and at that time had a net book value of Nil. Morella has completed all year 1 requirements with respect to the earn-in and have completed a passive seismic survey, a Magnetotelluric (MT) geophysical survey, received all permits for an 8 hole drilling program and prepared the first site and installed surface casing. Also they have previously shipped brine samples for further bench testing for amenability to direct lithium extraction (DLE), and have made provision to expand efforts in this regard while moving forward. On March 2, 2017 we issued a news release announcing that we had signed a letter of intent with Bormal Resources Inc. with respect to three tantalum-niobium (Ta-Nb) properties (Michael, Yeehaw, and Three Valley Gap) located in British Columbia, Canada. The Michael property in the Trail Creek Mining Division was originally staked to cover one of the most compelling tantalum in stream sediment anomalies as seen in the government RGS database in British Columbia. Bormal conducted a stream sediment sampling program in 2014, and determined that the tantalum-niobium in stream sediment anomaly here is bona fide, and in the order of 6 kilometers in length. In November of 2016 Lithium Corporation conducted a short soil geochemistry orientation program on the property as part of its due diligence, and determined that there are elevated levels of tantalum-niobium in soils here. Also in the general area of the Michael property, the Yeehaw property had been staked over a similar but lower amplitude tantalum/total rare earth elements (TREE s) in stream sediment anomaly. Both properties are situated within the Eocene Coryell Batholith, and at the time it was thought that these anomalies may arise from either carbonatite or pegmatite type deposits. The Company conducted a helicopter borne bio-geochemical survey on these two properties in June 2017, which did return anomalous results. This was followed up by a geological and geochemical examination of the Yeehaw property in early July 2017, and additional work of a similar nature later in July, and again in early October 2017. These examinations uncovered a zone roughly 30 meters wide which included an interval that is mineralized with approximately 0.75 TREE s. While markedly anomalous it is not exceedingly enriched in TREE s. However this zone may not be the main event in the area but a harbinger of bigger and better things, and also it is enriched in titanium (Ti), which could possibly be in the form of Perovskite, a mineral of considerable interest for the next generation of photo-voltaic cells. Preliminary geological and geochemical work were performed on the Michael property in October of 2016, followed by a brief airborne biogeochemical survey in June of 2017, and additional ground geological and geochemical assessment work in early October, 2017. The third property Three Valley Gap, is in the Revelstoke Mining Division and is situated in a locale where several Nb-Ta enriched carbonatites have been noted to occur. A brief field program by Bormal in 2015 located one of these carbonatites, and concurrent soil sampling determined that the soils here are enriched with Nb-Ta over the known carbonatite, and indicated that there are other geochemical anomalies locally that may indicate that more carbonatites exist here and are shallowly buried. 6 Table of Contents On February 23, 2018 we issued a news release announcing that we had dropped any interest in the Michael and Three Valley Gap properties, and had renegotiated the final share payment as required in the agreement from 750,000 to 400,000 shares. The final consideration shares were issued and the Yeehaw property has been transferred by Bormal. During 2017 the Company conducted initial stream, rock and magnetometer surveys on the property, and discovered a 30 meter wide lamprophyric dyke (Horseshoe Bend showing) that exhibits anomalous titanium/REE mineralization. The company staked an additional 5227 acre (2115.51 hectares) mineral claim and conducted a brief exploration program in Spring 2018 of geological mapping and rock and soil sampling on the property. This program discovered a slightly stronger zone of similar mineralization approximately 660 feet (200 meters) to the northwest of the Horseshoe Bend, and similar float mineralization another 0.75 miles (1.2 kms) further to the northwest. Additional work was performed on the property in 2019 and 2020 which extended the known strike of the Horseshoe Bend showing approximately 50 meters to the west, and mineralized float was found that possibly indicates it could continue to the east for another several hundred meters. The Company is currently in the planning stages for field season 2023. At the BC Sugar property in the Okanagan Highlands to the east of Vernon British Columbia the Company revised its trenching permit in 2017 and conducted a program of 12 mechanized test pits in May 2018. This work was done in an area ranging from 1 to 1.5 kilometers to the east of the Weather Station Zone in a zone of numerous discrete conductors detected during the 2015 FDEM geophysical survey. Three of these pits intercepted weathered weak to moderately mineralized graphitic material with the best assay being 2.62 graphitic, carbon, and six test pits bottomed in non-mineralized bedrock. The remaining three did not reach bedrock or intercept graphitic material prior to reaching the maximum digging capability of the excavating equipment used. The Company has reduced its acreage holdings here to approximately 203 acres (82 hectares) and is currently considering further work this year. Effective April 23, 2014, we entered into an operating agreement with All American Resources, L.L.C and TY Sons Investments Inc. with respect to Summa, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company incorporated on December 12, 2013, wherein we hold a 25 membership. Summa was formed to acquire and administer the residual lands that originated in the 60 s and 70 s through Howard Hughes s Hughes Corporation, which went on a mining property buying spree at that time. Our company's capital contribution to Summa, LLC was 125,000, of which 100,000 was in cash and the balance in services. To date we have contributed an additional 31,700 in cash, and also over the years an indeterminate amount of casual geological and land expertise to Summa, LLC. In recognition, Summa transferred five urban lots in Tonopah of indeterminate value in 2020, and since Jan 2021 have issued checks to the company for 167,500. The Tonopah property was optioned in early 2020, and the Optionee has earned a 100 interest in the property. Summa still retains a 1 (LTUM s share 0.25 Net Smelter Royalty on the property. Recently Summa entered into an agreement with North American Silver Corporation (TSX-V:NSC) whereby NSC can earn a 100 interest with respect to Summa s Belmont Nevada claims (not to be confused with the Belmont mine in Tonopah) by paying 200,000 in cash or at Optionor s discretion shares over 5 years, and election must be made by the sixth agreement anniversary to purchase the lands (69.96 acres) at 10,000 per acre. Should NSC earn their interest Summa, LLC would retain a 1 Net Smelter Royalty 50 of which may be subsequently purchased by the Optionor. Summa, LLC still retains a 100 interest (subject to a 2 NSR in favor of Summa Corp. (the successor entity to the Hughes Corporation) in a further five project areas in the state of Nevada, and Lithium Corporation remains committed to casually helping them move the projects along so that they may be optioned eventually. Competition The mining industry is intensely competitive. We compete with numerous individuals and companies, including many major mining companies, which have substantially greater technical, financial and operational resources and staffs. Accordingly, there is a high degree of competition for access to funds. There are other competitors that have operations in the area and the presence of these competitors could adversely affect our ability to compete for financing and obtain the service providers, staff or equipment necessary for the exploration and exploitation of our properties. Compliance with Government Regulation Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in United States and Canada, as well as other jurisdictions, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. 7 Table of Contents We believe that we are and will continue to be in compliance in all material respects with applicable statutes and the regulations passed in the United States and Canada. There are no current orders or directions relating to our company with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. Research and Development We have not incurred any research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years. Intellectual Property We do not currently have any intellectual property, other than our domain name and website, www.lithiumcorporation.com. Employees We have no employees. Our officers and directors provide their services to our company as independent consultants. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those set forth below: Risks Associated with Mining All of our properties are in the exploration stage. There is no assurance that we can establish the existence of any mineral resource on any of our properties in commercially exploitable quantities. Until we can do so, we cannot earn any revenues from operations and if we do not do so we will lose all of the funds that we expend on exploration. If we do not discover any mineral resource in a commercially exploitable quantity, our business could fail. 8 Table of Contents Despite exploration work on our mineral properties, we have not established that any of them contain any mineral reserve, nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to do so. If we do not, our business could fail. A mineral reserve is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its Industry Guide 7 (which can be viewed over the Internet at http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/industryguides.pdf) as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The probability of an individual prospect ever having a reserve that meets the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Industry Guide 7 is extremely remote; in all probability our mineral resource property does not contain any reserve and any funds that we spend on exploration will probably be lost. Even if we do eventually discover a mineral reserve on one or more of our properties, there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop our properties into producing mines and extract those resources. Both mineral exploration and development involve a high degree of risk and few properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The commercial viability of an established mineral deposit will depend on a number of factors including, by way of example, the size, grade and other attributes of the mineral deposit, the proximity of the resource to infrastructure such as a smelter, roads and a point for shipping, government regulation and market prices. Most of these factors will be beyond our control, and any of them could increase costs and make extraction of any identified mineral resource unprofitable. Mineral operations are subject to applicable law and government regulation. Even if we discover a mineral resource in a commercially exploitable quantity, these laws and regulations could restrict or prohibit the exploitation of that mineral resource. If we cannot exploit any mineral resource that we might discover on our properties, our business may fail. Both mineral exploration and extraction require permits from various foreign, federal, state, provincial and local governmental authorities and are governed by laws and regulations, including those with respect to prospecting, mine development, mineral production, transport, export, taxation, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety and other matters. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any of the permits required for the continued exploration of our mineral properties or for the construction and operation of a mine on our properties at economically viable costs. If we cannot accomplish these objectives, our business could fail. We believe that we are in compliance with all material laws and regulations that currently apply to our activities but there can be no assurance that we can continue to remain in compliance. Current laws and regulations could be amended and we might not be able to comply with them, as amended. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain all permits necessary for our future operations, or that we will be able to obtain them on reasonable terms. To the extent such approvals are required and are not obtained, we may be delayed or prohibited from proceeding with planned exploration or development of our mineral properties. If we establish the existence of a mineral resource on any of our properties in a commercially exploitable quantity, we will require additional capital in order to develop the property into a producing mine. If we cannot raise this additional capital, we will not be able to exploit the resource, and our business could fail. If we do discover mineral resources in commercially exploitable quantities on any of our properties, we will be required to expend substantial sums of money to establish the extent of the resource, develop processes to extract it and develop extraction and processing facilities and infrastructure. Although we may derive substantial benefits from the discovery of a major deposit, there can be no assurance that such a resource will be large enough to justify commercial operations, nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to raise the funds required for development on a timely basis. If we cannot raise the necessary capital or complete the necessary facilities and infrastructure, our business may fail. Mineral exploration and development is subject to extraordinary operating risks. We do not currently insure against these risks. In the event of a cave-in or similar occurrence, our liability may exceed our resources, which would have an adverse impact on our company. Mineral exploration, development and production involves many risks which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. Our operations will be subject to all the hazards and risks inherent in the exploration for mineral resources and, if we discover a mineral resource in commercially exploitable quantity, our operations could be subject to all of the hazards and risks inherent in the development and production of resources, including liability for pollution, cave-ins or similar hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure. Any such event could result in work stoppages and damage to property, including damage to the environment. We do not currently maintain any insurance coverage against these operating hazards. The payment of any liabilities that arise from any such occurrence would have a material adverse impact on our company. Mineral prices are subject to dramatic and unpredictable fluctuations. We expect to derive revenues, if any, either from the sale of our mineral resource properties or from the extraction and sale of lithium and/or associated byproducts. The price of those commodities has fluctuated widely in recent years, and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including international, economic and political trends, expectations of inflation, currency exchange fluctuations, interest rates, global or regional consumptive patterns, speculative activities and increased production due to new extraction developments and improved extraction and production methods. The effect of these factors on the price of base and precious metals, and therefore the economic viability of any of our exploration properties and projects, cannot accurately be predicted. 9 Table of Contents The mining industry is highly competitive and there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in acquiring mineral claims. If we cannot continue to acquire properties to explore for mineral resources, we may be required to reduce or cease operations. The mineral exploration, development, and production industry is largely un-integrated. We compete with other exploration companies looking for mineral resource properties. While we compete with other exploration companies in the effort to locate and acquire mineral resource properties, we will not compete with them for the removal or sales of mineral products from our properties if we should eventually discover the presence of them in quantities sufficient to make production economically feasible. Readily available markets exist worldwide for the sale of mineral products. Therefore, we will likely be able to sell any mineral products that we identify and produce. In identifying and acquiring mineral resource properties, we compete with many companies possessing greater financial resources and technical facilities. This competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire suitable prospects for exploration in the future. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will acquire any interest in additional mineral resource properties that might yield reserves or result in commercial mining operations. Risks Related to our Company The fact that we have not earned any operating revenues since our incorporation raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue to explore our mineral properties as a going concern. We have not generated any revenue from operations since our incorporation and we anticipate that we will continue to incur operating expenses without revenues unless and until we are able to identify a mineral resource in a commercially exploitable quantity on one or more of our mineral properties and we build and operate a mine. We had cash in the amount of 3,576,911 as of December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, we had working capital of 1,957,735. We incurred a net loss of 1,423,524 for the year ended December 31, 2022. We estimate our average monthly operating expenses to be approximately 74,000, including property costs, management services and administrative costs. Should the results of our planned exploration require us to increase our current operating budget, we may have to raise additional funds to meet our currently budgeted operating requirements for the next 12 months. As we cannot assure a lender that we will be able to successfully explore and develop our mineral properties, we will probably find it difficult to raise debt financing from traditional lending sources. We have traditionally raised our operating capital from sales of equity securities, but there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so. If we cannot raise the money that we need to continue exploration of our mineral properties, we may be forced to delay, scale back, or eliminate our exploration activities. If any of these were to occur, there is a substantial risk that our business would fail. Management has plans to seek additional capital through private placements of its capital stock. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our company s ability to continue as a going concern. Although there are no assurances that management s plans will be realized, management believes that our company will be able to continue operations in the future. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event our company cannot continue in existence. We continue to experience net operating losses. Risks Associated with Our Common Stock Trading on the OCTQB may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares. Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB electronic quotation service operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. Trading in stock quoted on the OTCQB is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTCQB is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTCQB is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like Nasdaq or a stock exchange like Amex. Accordingly, shareholders may have difficulty reselling any of the shares. 10 Table of Contents Our stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock may be restricted by the Securities and Exchange Commission s penny stock regulations and FINRA s sales practice requirements, which may limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock. Our stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors . The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of 5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of 1,000,000 or annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in, and limit the marketability of, our common stock. In addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the SEC, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA s requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock. Other Risks Trends, Risks and Uncertainties We have sought to identify what we believe to be the most significant risks to our business, but we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized nor can we guarantee that we have identified all possible risks that might arise. Investors should carefully consider all of such risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments As a smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 11 Table of Contents Item 2. Properties Our corporate head office is located at 1031 Railroad St., Ste 102B, Elko Nevada 89801, our monthly rent is 500 paid to a Rangefront Geological, a related party, which also includes storage space for field gear. We also rent office and storage space in Richland WA in support of our Yeehaw and BC Sugar prospects, which rent is also 500 per month. Additionally Lithium Corporation owns outright 2.3 acres (five lots) of undeveloped fee-title land in the town of Tonopah, NV. Mineral Properties Fish Lake Valley Property Fish Lake Valley is a lithium/boron/potassium enriched playa (also known as a salar, or salt pan), which is located in northern Esmeralda County in west central Nevada, and the area of greatest interest is roughly centered at 417050E 4195350N (NAD 27 CONUS). After staking numerous new claims in 2016 we currently hold 143, nominally 80-acre Association Placer claims that cover approximately 11,360 acres (4,597 hectares). Lithium-enriched Tertiary-era Fish Lake formation rhyolitic tuffs or ash flow tuffs have accumulated in a valley or basinal environment. Over time interstitial formational waters in contact with these tuffs, have become enriched in lithium, boron and potassium which could possibly be economic, and amenable to extraction by evaporative methods. The property was originally held under mining lease purchase agreement dated June 1, 2009, between Nevada Lithium Corporation, and Nevada Alaska Mining Co. Inc., Robert Craig, Barbara Craig, and Elizabeth Dickman. Nevada Lithium issued to the vendors 350,000 worth of common stock of our company in eight regular disbursements. All disbursements were made of stock worth a total of 350,000, and claim ownership was transferred to our company. The geological setting at Fish Lake Valley is highly analogous to the salars of Chile, Bolivia, and Peru, and more importantly Clayton Valley, where Albemarle has its Silver Peak lithium-brine operation. Access is excellent in Fish Lake Valley with all-weather gravel roads leading to the property from state highways 264, and 265, and maintained gravel roads ring the playa. Power is available approximately 10 miles from the property, and the village of Dyer is approximately 12 miles to the south, while the town of Tonopah, Nevada is approximately 50 miles to the east. Our company completed a number of geochemical and geophysical studies on the property, and conducted a short drill program on the periphery of the playa in the fall of 2010. Near-surface brine sampling during the spring of 2011 outlined a boron/lithium/potassium anomaly on the northern portions of the northern playa, that is roughly 1.3 x 2 miles long, which has a smaller higher grade core where lithium mineralization ranges from 100 to 150 mg/L (average 122.5 mg/L), with boron ranging from 1,500 to 2,670 mg/L (average 2,219 mg/L), and potassium from 5,400 to 8,400 mg/L (average 7,030 mg/L). Wet conditions on the playa precluded drilling there in 2011, and for a good portion of 2012, however a window of opportunity presented itself in late fall 2012. In November/December 2012 we conducted a short direct push drill program on the northern end of the playa, wherein a total of 1,240.58 feet (378.09 meters) was drilled in 20 holes at 17 discrete sites, and an area of 3,356 feet (1,023 meters) by 2,776 feet (846 meters) was systematically explored by grid probing. The deepest hole was 81 feet (24.69 meters), and the shallowest hole that produced brine was 34 feet (10.36 meters). The average depth of the holes drilled during the program was 62 feet (18.90 meters). The program successfully demonstrated that lithium-boron-potassium-enriched brines exist to at least 62 feet (18.9 meters) depth in sandy or silty aquifers that vary from approximately three to ten feet (one to three meters) in thickness. Average lithium, boron and potassium contents of all samples are 47.05 mg/L, 992.7 mg/L, and 0.535 respectively, with lithium values ranging from 7.6 mg/L to 151.3 mg/L, boron ranging from 146 to 2,160.7 mg/L, and potassium ranging from 0.1 to 1.3 . The anomaly outlined by the program is 1,476 by 2,461 feet (450 meters by 750 meters), and is not fully delimited, as the area available for probing was restricted due to soft ground conditions to the east and to the south. A 50 mg/L lithium cutoff is used to define this anomaly and within this zone average lithium, boron and potassium contents are 90.97 mg/L, 1,532.92 mg/L, and 0.88 respectively. On September 3, 2013, we announced that drilling had commenced at Fish Lake Valley. Due to storms and wet conditions in the area that our company had hoped to concentrate on, the playa was not passable, and so the program concentrated on larger step-out drilling well off the playa. This 11 hole, 1,025 foot program did prove that mineralization does not extend much, if at all, past the margins of the playa, as none of the fluids encountered in this program were particularly briny, and returned values of less than 5 mg/L lithium. Results from the work done in the past by Lithium Corporation have been very positive, and our company believes that the playa at Fish Lake Valley may be conducive to the formation of a Silver Peak style lithium brine deposit. 12 Table of Contents Early in 2016 the company signed an Exploration Earn-In Agreement with 1032701 B.C. Ltd., a private British Columbia company with respect to our Fish Lake Valley lithium brine property, wherein 1032701 B.C. Ltd., may acquire an initial 80 undivided interest in the Fish Lake Valley property through the payment of an aggregate of US 300,000 in cash, completing a Going Public Transaction on or before May 6, 2016, and subject to the completion of the Going Public Transaction, arranging for the issuance of a total of 400,000 common shares in the capital of the resulting issuer as follows: (i) within five business days following the effective date, Pay 100,000 to our company and issue 200,000 common shares of the TSX-V listed public company. On or before the first anniversary of the signing of the Definitive Agreement pay 100,000 to our company and issue 100,000 common shares of the Optionee/TSX-V listed public company. On or before the second anniversary of the signing of the definitive agreement pay 100,000 to our company and issue 100,000 common shares of the Optionee/TSX-V listed public company. The Optionee needed to make qualified exploration or development expenditures on the property of 200,000 before the first anniversary, an additional 300,000 before the second anniversary, an additional 600,000 prior to the third anniversary, and make all payments and perform all other acts to maintain the Property in good standing before fully earning their 80 interest. Additionally, after the initial earn-in the Optionee had the right for up to 12 months to purchase our 20 interest in the property for 1,000,000, at which point our interest would have reverted to a 2 1/2 Net Smelter Royalty (NSR). The Optionee could then have elected at any time to purchase one half (1.25 of our NSR for 1,000,000. American Lithium Corp. subsequently acquired 100 of 1032701 BC, and a formal option agreement was entered into, effective March 31, 2016. An amendment to the agreement was entered into on the 14 th of February 2018 whereby American Lithium issued 10,000 post consolidation Agreement Year shares to Lithium Corporation as mandated by the agreement, as well as a further 80,000 shares in consideration for Lithium Corporation agreeing to extend the work commitment date for Year 2 of the agreement to September 30, 2018. We had received all money, and common shares issuable in relation to the Fish Lake Valley option agreement, but the Purchaser issued formal notice of the relinquishment of the Purchasers right to earn the interest in the property on April 30 th 2019. As this was the termination of the option agreement 443,308 was taken into income. During the year-ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a 159,859 allowance for the properties and has a net book value of Nil. On April 29, 2021 we signed a Letter Of Intent (LOI) with Altura Mining Limited (now Morella Corporation after a name change), an Australian Lithium explorer and developer and a related party, whereby Morella can earn a 60 interest in the Fish Lake Valley lithium-in-brine property in Esmeralda County, Nevada by paying the Company 675,000, issuing the equivalent of 500,000 worth of Morella stock, and expending 2,000,000 of exploration work over the next four years. To date Morella is current with its obligations under the formal agreement ratified on October 12th 2021, having paid the initial 50,000 on signing the LOI, the 100,000 due on signing the formal agreement, and has issued 28,176,951 shares of Morella (1MC:ASX, Altaf:OTC-QB) common stock. Recently Morella has indicated that they have completed Passive Seismic and Magneto-telluric surveys, have permitted 8 drill sites, and have installed surface casing on the first site and have been conducting ongoing tests for amenability to direct lithium extraction (DLE). San Emidio Property The San Emidio property, located in Washoe County in northwestern Nevada, was acquired through the staking of claims in September 2011. The twenty, 80-acre, Association Placer claims currently held here cover an area of approximately 1,600 acres (640 hectares). Ten claims in the southern portions of the original claim block that was staked in 2011 were allowed to lapse on September 1, 2012, and a further ten claims were then staked and recorded. These new claims are north of and contiguous to the surviving claims from our earlier block. In 2015 eight claims were allowed to lapse, but then in 2016 a further 10 claims were staked and recorded. The property is approximately 65 miles north-northeast of Reno, Nevada, and has excellent infrastructure. 13 Table of Contents We identified this prospect during 2009, and 2010 through surficial geochemical sampling, and geological interpretation. The early reconnaissance sampling determined that anomalous values for lithium occur in sediments over a good portion of the playa. Our company conducted near-surface brine sampling in the spring of 2011, and a high resolution gravity geophysical survey in summer/fall 2011. Our company then permitted a 7 hole drilling program with the Bureau of Land Management in late fall 2011, and a direct push drill program was commenced in early February 2012. Drilling here delineated a narrow elongated shallow brine reservoir which is greater than 2.5 miles length, somewhat distal to the basinal feature outlined by the earlier gravity survey. The anomaly aligns with the present day topographical low in the valley, which could be the result of extension along a north-easterly trending fault. Two values of over 20 milligrams/liter lithium were obtained from two shallow direct push probe holes located centrally in this brine anomaly. We drilled this prospect in late October 2012, further testing the area of the property in the vicinity where prior exploration by our company discovered elevated lithium levels in subsurface brines. During the 2012 program a total of 856 feet (260.89 meters) was drilled at 8 discrete sites. The deepest hole was 160 feet (48.76 meters), and the shallowest hole that produced brine was 90 feet (27.43 meters). The average depth of the seven hole program was 107 feet (32.61 meters). The program better defined the lithium-in-brine anomaly that was discovered in early 2012. This anomaly is approximately 0.6 miles (370 meters) wide at its widest point by more than 2 miles (3 kilometers) long. The peak value seen within the anomaly is 23.7 mg/l lithium, which is 10 to 20 times background levels outside the anomaly. Our company believes that, much like Fish Lake Valley, the playa at San Emidio may be conducive to the formation of a Silver Peak style lithium brine deposit, and the recent drilling indicates that the anomaly occurs at or near the intersection of several faults that may have provided the structural setting necessary for the formation of a lithium-in-brine deposit at depth. Our company entered into an exploration earn-in agreement on the property on May 3, 2016 with 1067323 B.C. Ltd., wherein the Optionee was to pay an initial 100,000 and issue 100,000 shares within 30 days of a Going Public Transaction . 1067323 subsequently merged with American Lithium Corp., who then assumed the duties of the Optionee, and fulfilled the initial obligations. The further terms of the agreement were that American Lithium was to issue 100,000 shares to Lithium Corporation on or before both the first second anniversaries of the going public transaction. Additionally American Lithium was to conduct 100,000 exploration work in year 1, 200,000 in year 2, and 300,000 in year 3. On fulfillment of all its obligations American Lithium would have earned an 80 interest in the property. The Optionee also had the option to earn a further 20 interest in the property by paying 1,000,000 to the company within 36 months of the exercise of the initial earn-in. If American Lithium had exercised its right with respect to the subsequent earn-in then Lithium Corporation s interest would have reverted to a 2.5 Net Smelter Revenue (NSR) interest. American Lithium then could have purchased one half of the NSR (1.25 for 1,000,000 at any time thereafter. In June 2018, the Company received notification that the purchaser was relinquishing any right to earn an interest in the property and, as such, 202,901 was taken into income. During the year-ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a 217,668 allowance for the property which then had a net book value of Nil. Lithium Corporation was granted a drilling permit in 2019 to drill three drill holes here, and had intended to drill in 2020, however the weak market for lithium carbonate precluded expending capital on this project, and so drilling was delayed until such time as the market picked up again. On September 16 th 2021 Lithium Corporation signed an agreement with Surge Battery Metals whereby Surge may earn an 80 interest in the Company s San Emidio lithium-in-brine prospect in Washoe County Nevada, by paying an initial 50,000 and issuing 200,000 shares of Surge (TSX-V:Nili). Surge had undertaken to make payments of 620,000 in cash and stock over 5 years while incurring expenditures on the property of 1,000,000 over that period. Upon fulfillment of the aforementioned commitments Surge would have been deemed to have earned their undivided 80 interest and could have formed a joint venture with the Company. Surge Battery Metals completed some geochemical work on the prospect block and gave Lithium Corporation formal notice in Summer 2022 that they were relinquishing all interest in the property. In Fall 2022 the Company completed a Controlled Source Audio-Magnetotelluric (CSAMT) survey on the property, and is currently considering next steps with respect to exploring and developing this property. 14 Table of Contents BC Sugar Flake Graphite Property On June 6, 2013, we entered into a mining claim sale agreement with Herb Hyder wherein Mr. Hyder agreed to sell to our company a 50.829 acre (20.57 hectare) claim located in the Cherryville area of British Columbia. As consideration for the purchase of the property, we issued 250,000 shares of our company s common stock to Mr. Hyder. In addition to the acquired claim, our company staked or acquired another 13 claims at various times over the subsequent months, to bring the total area held under tenure to approximately 19,816 acres (8,020 hectares). Since that time the company has let all but what appears to be the most prospective claims lapse, and currently the company holds one title the Heavy Weather claim that is 1422 acres (575.67 hectares) in size. The flake graphite mineralization of interest here is hosted predominately in graphitic quartz/biotite, and lesser graphitic calc-silicate gneisses. The rocks and mineralization in the general area of the BC Sugar prospect are similar to the host rocks in the area of the crystal graphite deposit 55 miles (90 kms) to the southeast that is being mined by Eagle Graphite. The BC Sugar property is within the Shushwap Metamorphic Complex, in a geological environment favorable for the formation of flake graphite deposits, and is in an area of excellent logistics and infrastructure, with a considerable network of logging roads within the project area. Additionally the town of Lumby is approximately 19 miles (30 kms) to the south of the property, while the City of Vernon is only 30 miles (50 kms) to the southwest of the western portions of the claim block. Work progressed, and the property expanded throughout the summer of 2013, and culminated with the receipt of the final assays from the last phases of the prospecting and geological program in December of 2013. That work increased the area known to be underlain by graphitic bearing gneisses, and further evaluations were made in the area of the Sugar Lake, Weather Station, and Taylor Creek showings. In the general vicinity of the Weather Station showing that was initially discovered in early July 2013, a further 13 samples were taken, and hand trenching was performed at one of several outcrops in the area. In the trench a 5.2 meter interval returned an average of 3.14 graphitic carbon, all in an oxidized relatively friable gneissic host rock. Additionally a hydrothermal or vein type mineralized graphitic quartz boulder was discovered in the area which graded up to 4.19 graphitic carbon. The source of this boulder was not discovered during this program, but it is felt to be close to its point of origin. Samples representative of the mineralization encountered here were taken for petrographic study, which was received in late 2013. A brief assessment work program was performed in September 2014 to ensure all claims in the package were in good standing prior to the anticipated sale of this asset to Pathion Inc. Recommendations were made by the consulting geologist who wrote the assessment report with respect to trenching, and eventually drilling the Weather Station showing. Our company submitted a Notice of Work to the BC Government in early May 2015 to enable our company to conduct a program of excavator trenching, sampling and geological mapping on the Weather Station showing. In May of 2015 we signed an agreement with KLM Geosciences LLC of Las Vegas to conduct a short Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey on the property in the Weather Station Taylor Creek areas. The GPR survey as well as a GEM-2 frequency domain electromagnetic (FDEM) survey took place in approximately mid-May 2015. The GPR survey did not provide useful data because of the moisture saturation in the shallow subsurface. The FDEM survey successfully generated an anomaly over known mineralization and possibly indicates that the mineralization may extend both to the west and to the east in areas blanketed by glaciofluvial till. In August of 2015 our Notice of Work for trenching was approved by the BC Government and in October we commenced work. A trench of 265.76 feet (81 meters) was excavated and graphitic gneiss was mapped and sampled. In all 23 samples were taken over the 69 meters of exposed mineralization that could be safely sampled. Trench depths varied from 1.2 meters in areas of semi-consolidated rock to 4.8 meters in areas of mainly decomposed material. There was an approximately 12 meter section of the trench of sand, and fluvial till in an ancient stream bed where the excavator could not reach the graphitic material that is inferred to exist at depths greater than 5 meters. Also there was a 4 meter section at depths from 4.8 to 5 meters where graphite mineralization could be seen at depth, but could not be safely sampled. 15 Table of Contents The entire 69 meter interval that was sampled averaged 1.997 graphitic carbon, and mineralization remains open in all directions. Within that interval there was a 30 meter section that averaged 2.73 graphitic carbon, and within that interval there was a 12 meter section that averaged 2.99 graphitic carbon. The best mineralization, and most friable material is proximal to the aforementioned abandoned creek channel, and it appears that proximity to this feature gave rise to the deep weathering profile encountered here. Determining the tenor, and extent of the friable material were the two major objectives of this program as this material, which is very similar to that mined at Eagle Graphite s operation is very easy/economical to be mined and processed, and typically contains the highest percentages of graphite over consistent widths. A mini-bulk sample was taken from the Weather Station Zone in October 2017, and submitted to SGS Vancouver for preliminary bench tests, and further petrographic analysis. Tests indicated that the fairly coarse flake graphite was easily liberated from the unconsolidated host material, and initial flotation tests were positive with over 80 of the graphite in the sample being floated off. The Company revised its trenching permit in 2017 and conducted a program of 12 mechanized test pits in May 2018. This work was done in an area ranging from 1 to 1.5 kilometers to the east of the Weather Station Zone in a zone of numerous discrete conductors detected during the 2015 FDEM geophysical survey. Three of these pits intercepted weathered weak to moderately mineralized graphitic material with the best assay being 2.62 graphitic, carbon, and six test pits bottomed in non-mineralized bedrock. The remaining three did not reach bedrock or intercept graphitic material prior to reaching the maximum digging capability of the excavating equipment used. The Company had reduced its acreage holdings here to approximately 203 acres (82 hectares) to facilitate applying 5 years assessment credit to the most prospective area of the property, and had placed it on the back burner in favor of developing other prospects. The Company is currently in the planning stages with respect to the work to be done on these prospects this summer. The Hughes Claims Effective April 23, 2014, we entered into an operating agreement with All American Resources, LLC and TY Sons Investments Inc. with respect to Summa, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company incorporated on December 12, 2013. Through our 25 membership interest in Summa we hold an indirect interest in a number of patented mining claims that spring from the once considerable mineral holdings of Howard Hughes s Summa Corp. Our company s capital contribution paid to Summa, LLC was 125,000, of which 100,000 was in cash and the balance in services. Lithium Corporation participated in the formation of Summa, which holds 88 fee-title patented lode claims that cover approximately 1,191.3 acres of prospective mineral lands. Our company signed a joint operating agreement with the other participants in Spring 2014 to govern the conduct of Summa, and the development of the lands. Our company s director, Tom Lewis, was named as a managing member of Summa, and as such has a direct say in the day to day operations of that company. The Hughes lands are situated in six discrete prospect areas in Nevada, the most notable of which being the Tonopah block in Nye County where Summa holds 56 claims that cover approximately 770 acres in the heart of the historic mining camp where over 1.8 million ounces of gold and 174 million ounces of silver were produced predominately in the early 1900 s. The Hughes claims include a number of the prolific past producers in Tonopah, such as the Belmont, the Desert Queen, and the Midway mines. In addition there are also claims in the area of the past producing Klondyke East mining district, which is to the south of Tonopah, and at the town of Belmont (not to be confused with the Belmont claim in Tonopah), Nevada, another notable silver producer from the 1800 s, which is roughly 40 miles to the northeast of Tonopah. Summa has conducted preliminary research on the Hughes properties, focusing on the Tonopah area where reporting in the 1980 s, indicated that over 2.175 million tons of mine dumps and mill tailings exist at surface on Summa s properties that contain in the order of 3.453 million ounces of silver, and 28,500 ounces of gold. In addition to this easily extractable surficial resource, other reports indicate that 300 - 500,000 tons of mineralized material is expected to remain at depth in old workings on Summa s properties, which is believed to contain an average 20 ounces silver and 0.20 ounces gold per ton. Also several partially tested exploration targets have been identified on Summa s Tonopah claims, where further work could potentially lead to a marked increase in known underground resources. 16 Table of Contents West Kirkland Mining has been working on the development of their 75 owned project in Tonopah, most recently drilling to increase the resource at the Three Hills gold/silver deposit where they intend to kick-off their mining efforts in the future. To that end they have bought an additional six patented mining claims here recently, and have also negotiated an agreement to procure rights for the water that they will need for processing. Presently the reserve at their Hasbrouck/Three Hills/Hill of Gold project stands at 45.3 million tons containing 762,000 ounces gold, and 10.6 million ounces Silver. Coeur Mines and partner Idaho North Resources drilled in the Klondyke area to the south of Tonopah (the same area where Summa holds several patented mining claims that arise from the Hughes acquisition), and have done some drilling recently in Tonopah on a prospect they have optioned adjacent and to the west of Summa s holdings. In 2018 Coeur Mines also conducted drilling on Ely Gold s claims to the west of Summa s property on Patented claims that were once a portion of the Hughes holdings here. Although it has been reported that they intersected 5 of 20 opt Ag, 0.3 opt Au, Coeur dropped their interest in this property. Recently Ely Gold entered into an agreement to purchase a further 75 patented claims adjacent to their Tonopah West prospect, and again announced on February 25, 2020 that they have signed a purchase/option agreement with Blackrock Gold Corp on the property. Under the terms of the agreement Blackrock is to pay 3,000,000 by April 01, 2020, and Ely will retain a 3 Nets Smelter Royalty on the property. Since June of 2020 Blackrock has drilled a number of holes on their property with significant focus and some relatively high grade intercepts on the Victor vein only a few hundred meters to the northwest of the mutual boundary with Summa s land package. Slightly further afield Gemfield Resources LLC., (a subsidiary of Waterton Global Resource Management) has recently completed the re-routing of Highway 95 south of Tonopah to facilitate the imminent mining of their 1.5 million ounce gold deposit near Goldfield Nevada. The ongoing litigation with respect to Summa s Tonopah holdings had precluded investing time or money into the property immediately after the court awarded Summa ownership in 2013, however in 2018 Summa won a quiet title case in the Fifth Judicial Court in Tonopah, which determined that Summas title is superior to all other claimants. The subsequent appeal of this verdict was quashed later in 2018, and there has been no further action on that account. Summa signed a Letter of Intent on January 14, 2020 with respect to the Tonopah property whereby 1237025 BC Ltd, can earn a 100 interest in the property (subject to a 1.0 Net Smelter Royalty or NSR) by paying 400,000 in cash, issuing 400,000 in shares, and incurring 1.5 million in exploration expenditures in stages over the next 5 years. The Optionee would also have the right to purchase of the NSR for 1,500,000, and the future right to purchase a further of the NSR for 2,500,000. The definitive agreement was signed in March of 2020, and 1237025 BC Ltd subsequently merged with Pinnacle North Gold Corp., who then changed their name to Summa Silver Corp. Summa Silver actively explored the property in the second half of 2020, drilling roughly 14,000 meters in 29 drill holes. Additionally more work was performed on the Belmont tailings portion of the project aided by Lithium Corporation personnel, who have been actively promoting and advancing this aspect of the Tonopah holdings since acquisition. In 2021 Summa Silver accelerated the earn-in provisions of the option agreement and was transferred a 100 interest in the property. Summa still retains a 1 (LTUM s share 0.25 Net Smelter Royalty on the property. Recently Summa entered into an agreement with North American Silver Corporation (TSX-V:NSC) with respect to Summa s Belmont Nevada claims (not to be confused with the Belmont mine in Tonopah) whereby NSC can earn a 100 interest by paying 200,000 in cash or at Optionor s discretion shares over 5 years, and election must be made by the sixth agreement anniversary to purchase the lands (69.96 acres) at 10,000 per acre. Should NSC earn their interest Summa, LLC would retain a 1 Net Smelter Royalty 50 of which may be subsequently purchased by the Optionor. Summa, LLC still retains a 100 interest (subject to a 2 NSR in favor of Summa Corp. (the successor entity to the Hughes Corporation) in a further five project areas in the state of Nevada, and Lithium Corporation remains committed to casually helping them move the projects along so that they may be optioned eventually. North Big Smoky Property During the period 2011 through 2012 the Company conducted geophysical, and geochemical work on BLM lands in North Big Smoky Valley, Nye County Nevada, in an area that proved to be geochemically anomalous, both in sediment and brines. The geological setting in this area is quite similar to that at our other brine prospects, and Clayton Valley to the southwest of here, and had experienced some geothermal and petroleum exploration in the past. In April of 2016 Lithium Royalty Corp (a wholly owned subsidiary through which we had planned to build a portfolio of lithium mineral properties) acquired through staking the North Big Smoky Prospect, a block of placer mineral claims in Nye County Nevada. On May 13, 2016 our wholly owned subsidiary sold 100 of the interest in the property to 1069934 Nevada Ltd. ("Purchaser") a private company. Consideration paid to Lithium Royalty Corp. consisted of mainly of 300,000 shares in the "Purchaser Parent", 1069934 B.C. Ltd, and retained a royalty on the property. No appreciable work was done and by agreement dated September 13, 2017 Lithium Corporation agreed to sell back the shares of 1069934 Nevada Ltd. to San Antone Minerals Corp (successor corporation) who subsequently allowed the claims here to lapse. This area was subsequently re-staked by Lithium Corporation in March 2022, and optioned to Morella Corporation, a related company, who have completed Controlled Source Audio-Magnetotelluric (CSAMT) and Sediment Geochemical surveys on the property in 2022. 17 Table of Contents British Columbia Tantalum/REE/Titanium Properties On March 1 st 2017 the company signed a letter of intent (LOI) with Bormal Resources Inc. wherein the company may earn an interest in three properties in British Columbia. The Michael property in the Trail Creek Mining Division was originally staked by Bormal to cover one of the most compelling tantalum (Ta) in stream sediment anomalies as seen in the government RGS database in British Columbia. Bormal conducted a stream sediment sampling program in 2014, and determined that the tantalum-niobium (Nb) in stream sediment anomaly is bona fide, and in the order of 6 kilometers in length. In November of 2016 Lithium Corporation conducted a short soil geochemical orientation program on the property as part of its due diligence, and determined that there are elevated levels of niobium-tantalum in soils here. Also in the general area of the Michael property the Yeehaw prospect has been staked by Bormal over a similar but lower amplitude Tantalum/Rare Earth Element (REE s) stream sediment anomaly. Both properties are situated depicted on government geological maps as being within the Eocene Coryell batholith, and it is thought that these anomalies may arise from either carbonatite or pegmatite type deposits. The third property at Three Valley Gap, is in the Revelstoke Mining Division and is situated in a locale where several Nb-Ta enriched carbonatites have been noted to occur. A brief field program by Bormal in 2015 located one of these carbonatites, and concurrent soil sampling determined that the soils here are enriched with Nb-Ta over the known carbonatite, and indicated that there are other geochemical anomalies locally that may indicate that more carbonatites exist here and are shallowly buried. Lithium Corporation conducted fieldwork on the Michael, and Yeehaw properties during summer 2017. At Yeehaw a 30 meter wide structure was discovered that is anomalous for titanium and Rare Earth Elements, while soil sampling at Michael detected an anomaly that is greater than 800 meters in length that exhibits increased Tantalum-Niobium plus Rare Earth Element mineralization. The Company has dropped any further interest in both the Michael and Three Valley Gap properties, and has earned its 100 interest in the Yeehaw property. Field work on the Yeehaw property in Spring 2018 discovered a further zone of Ti/REE enrichment, and additional work was performed on the property in 2019 which extended the known strike of the Horseshoe Bend showing approximately 50 meters to the west, and mineralized float was found that possibly indicates it could continue to the east for another several hundred meters. The Company is currently in the planning stages for field season 2023. Our company has been financing progressively since Spring 2021, and is ramping up exploration activities on our existing properties, as well as embarking on a generative program exploring for new deposits of next generation battery related materials and are currently pursuing other properties which are believed to be prospective for hosting lithium, graphite or other energy metals as well as continuing to evaluate opportunities brought to our company by third parties. Item 3. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. We are not involved in any pending legal proceeding or litigation and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we area party or to which any of our properties is subject, which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on us, except for the following: Lithium Corporations interest in the Tonopah Hughes property through its ownership of 25 of Summa, LLC was challenged in 2015. On March 13, 2018 Summa was victorious in a Quiet Title ruling set out in the Fifth Judicial District Court where Judge Wanker ruled that Summa s claim to title in the contested claims was superior to that of any other entity that has come forward with a claim to date. An appeal of that decision filed later in 2018 was denied by the courts, and no further actions have since been filed. 18 Table of Contents Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data As a smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 20 Table of Contents Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report, particularly in the section entitled Risk Factors beginning on page 6 of this annual report. Our consolidated audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Plan of Operations and Cash Requirements Cash Requirements Our current operational focus is to conduct exploration activities on the Yeehaw, and BC Sugar properties in British Columbia, and the San Emidio, PLR and Overton properties in Nevada, while working towards generating other energy metals related projects. We expect to review other potential exploration third-party projects from time to time as they are presented to us. Our net cash from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was 1,656,000 as compared to 2,054,028 during the year ended December 31, 2021. As at December 31, 2022, we had approximately 3,576,911 in cash. Over the next twelve months (beginning March 1, 2023) we expect to expend funds as follows: Estimated Net Expenditures During the Next Twelve Months General, Administrative Expenses 150,000 Exploration Expenses 500,000 Investor Relations 40,000 Employee and Consultant Compensation 131,000 Equipment 40,000 Travel 30,000 Total 891,000 We have suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is dependent upon our company attaining and maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed. The continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing, a successful program of exploration and/or development, and, finally, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. As noted herein, we are pursuing various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations. 21 Table of Contents Results of Operations - Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, which are included herein. Our operating results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and the changes between those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows: Twelve Month Period Ended December 31, 2022 Twelve Month Period Ended December 31, 2021 Change Between Twelve Month Periods Ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 Revenue - - - Professional fees 57,740 74,521 (16,781 Depreciation 7,332 - 7,332 Exploration expenses related party 15,151 12,234 2,917 Exploration expenses 144,816 33,756 111,060 Consulting fees related party 459,772 120,000 339,772 Consulting fees 474,425 560,880 (86,455 Transfer agent and filing fees 26,679 27,893 (1,214 Travel 16,085 12,711 3,374 General and administrative 32,619 13,789 18,830 Change in fair value of marketable securities 258,689 987,489 (728,880 Other income (69,784 (98,000 28,216 Net loss 1,423,524 1,745,273 321,749 Our financial statements report a net loss of 1,423,524 for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2022 compared to a net loss of 1,745,273 for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021. Our losses have decreased by 321,749, primarily as a result of a decrease in the loss resulting from a change in fair value of marketable securities offset by increases in consulting fees and exploration expenses. Our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 1,234,619 compared to 855,784 as of December 31, 2021. The increase in operating expenses was across the board as the Company looked to ramp up expenditures in efforts to heighten the profile of the company, while trying to move its properties further along the continuum towards development. 22 Table of Contents Liquidity and Financial Condition Working Capital At December 31, 2022 At December 31, 2021 Current assets 3,988,415 2,659,106 Current liabilities 2,030,680 1,601,926 Working capital (deficiency) 1,957,735 1,057,180 Cash Flows Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 Net cash (used in) operating activities (466,528 (202,032 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 144,318 200,000 Net cash provided by financing activities 1,656,000 2,054,028 Net increase (decrease) in cash during period 1,333,790 2,051,996 Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was 466,528 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared with net cash used in operating activities of 202,032 in the same period in 2021.

Financing Activities On January 25, 2021 we entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement ), and a registration rights agreement, (the Registration Rights Agreement ), with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC Lincoln Park ), pursuant to which Lincoln Park has committed to purchase up to 10,300,000 of the Company s common stock, 0.001 par value per share (the Common Stock ). In connection with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, the Company sold, and Lincoln Park purchased, 380,952 shares of Common Stock for a purchase price of 160,000 Original Purchase ), and then another 357,995 shares Initial Purchase for 150,000 after SEC approval of the S-1 document in April 2021. Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to 10,300,000 worth of shares of Common Stock. Such sales of Common Stock by the Company, if any, will be subject to certain limitations, and may occur from time to time, at the Company s sole discretion, over the 36-month period commencing on the date that a registration statement covering the resale of shares of Common Stock that have been and may be issued under the Purchase Agreement, which the Company agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, is declared effective by the SEC and a final prospectus in connection therewith is filed and the other conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement are satisfied, all of which are outside the control of Lincoln Park (such date on which all of such conditions are satisfied, the Commencement Date ). The Company shall also have the right, but not the obligation to sell to Lincoln Park up to 150,000 of shares of Common Stock on the Commencement Date at the Purchase Price (as defined below). 23 Table of Contents Under the Purchase Agreement, on any business day over the term of the Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to present Lincoln Park with a purchase notice (each, a Purchase Notice directing Lincoln Park to purchase up to 100,000 shares of Common Stock per business day, which increases to up to 150,000 shares in the event the price of the Company s Common Stock is not below 0.25 per share; up to 200,000 shares in the event the price of the Company s Common Stock is not below 0.35 per share and up to 250,000 shares in the event the price of the Company s Common Stock is not below 0.50 (the Regular Purchase (subject to adjustment for any reorganization, recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar transaction as provided in the Purchase Agreement). In each case, Lincoln Park s maximum commitment in any single Regular Purchase may not exceed 500,000. The Purchase Agreement provides for a purchase price per Purchase Share (the Purchase Price equal to 93 of the lesser of: the lowest sale price of the Company s Common Stock on the purchase date; and the average of the three lowest closing sale prices for the Company s Common Stock during the twelve consecutive business days ending on the business day immediately preceding the purchase date of such shares. In addition, on any date on which the Company submits a Purchase Notice to Lincoln Park, the Company also has the right, in its sole discretion, to present Lincoln Park with an accelerated purchase notice (each, an Accelerated Purchase Notice directing Lincoln Park to purchase an amount of stock (the Accelerated Purchase equal to up to the lesser of (i) three times the number of shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to such Regular Purchase; and (ii) 30 of the aggregate shares of the Company s Common Stock traded during all or, if certain trading volume or market price thresholds specified in the Purchase Agreement are crossed on the applicable Accelerated Purchase Date, the portion of the normal trading hours on the applicable Accelerated Purchase Date prior to such time that any one of such thresholds is crossed (such period of time on the applicable Accelerated Purchase Date, the Accelerated Purchase Period ). The purchase price per share of Common Stock for each such Accelerated Purchase will be equal to 93 of the lesser of: the volume weighted average price of the Company s Common Stock during the applicable Accelerated Purchase Period on the applicable Accelerated Purchase Date; and the closing sale price of the Company s Common Stock on the applicable Accelerated Purchase Date. Lincoln Park has no right to require the Company to sell any shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park, but Lincoln Park is obligated to make purchases as the Company directs, subject to certain conditions. There are no upper limits on the price per share that Lincoln Park must pay for shares of Common Stock. The Company issued to Lincoln Park 1,375,779 shares of Common Stock as commitment shares in consideration for entering into the Purchase Agreement on the Execution Date. Actual sales of shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by the Company as to the appropriate sources of funding for the Company and its operations. Lincoln Park has no right to require any sales by the Company but is obligated to make purchases from the Company as it directs in accordance with the Purchase Agreement. Lincoln Park has covenanted not to cause or engage in any manner whatsoever, any direct or indirect short selling or hedging of the Company s shares. At the end of the fiscal year on December 31, 2022 the company has sold 16,665,018 common shares to Lincoln Park for gross proceeds of 3,710,028, and to April 12th, 2023 the Company has sold 18,865,018 shares for gross proceeds of 3,945,428. 24 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations As a smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations. Going Concern As of December 31, 2022, our company had a net loss of 1,423,524 and has earned no revenues. Our company intends to continue funding operations through our financing arrangement with Lincoln Park Capital, which should be sufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending December 31, 2022. The ability of our company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of our business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements. Exploration Stage Company The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles related to accounting and reporting by exploration stage companies. An exploration stage company is one in which planned principal operations have not commenced or if its operations have commenced, there has been no significant revenues there from. Accounting Basis The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP" accounting). The Company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash includes cash on account, demand deposits, and short-term instruments with maturities of three months or less. Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, the balances of which at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company continually monitors its banking relationships and consequently has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. 25 Table of Contents Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition The Company has yet to realize revenues from operations. Once the Company has commenced operations, it will recognize revenues when delivery of goods or completion of services has occurred provided there is persuasive evidence of an agreement, acceptance has been approved by its customers, the fee is fixed or determinable based on the completion of stated terms and conditions, and collection of any related receivable is probable. Loss per Share Basic loss per share is computed by dividing loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The computation of diluted earnings per share assumes the conversion, exercise or contingent issuance of securities only when such conversion, exercise or issuance would have a dilutive effect on earnings per share. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the "if converted" method. In the periods in which a loss is incurred, the effect of potential issuances of shares under options and warrants would be anti-dilutive, and therefore basic and diluted losses per share are the same. Income Taxes The asset and liability approach is used to account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Financial Instruments The Company's financial instruments consist of cash, deposits, prepaid expenses, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Unless otherwise noted, it is management's opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. Because of the short maturity and capacity of prompt liquidation of such assets and liabilities, the fair value of these financial instruments approximate their carrying values, unless otherwise noted. Mineral Properties Costs of exploration, carrying and retaining unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as incurred. Mineral property acquisition costs are capitalized including licenses and lease payments. Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest, these procedures do not guarantee the Company's title. Such properties may be subject to prior agreements or transfers and title may be affected by undetected defects. Impairment losses are recorded on mineral properties used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amount. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Leases (Topic 842). In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ASU 2016-02 ). The new standard establishes a right-of-use ROU model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. 26 Table of Contents The Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2019. The standard allows a number of optional practical expedients to use for transition. The Company choose the certain practical expedients allowed under the transition guidance which permitted us to not to reassess any existing or expired contracts to determine if they contain embedded leases, to not to reassess our lease classification on existing leases, to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for equipment leases, and whether initial direct costs previously capitalized would qualify for capitalization under FASB ASC 842. The new standard also provides practical expedients and recognition exemptions for an entity's ongoing accounting policy elections. The Company has elected the short-term lease recognition for all leases that qualify, which means that we do not recognize a ROU asset and lease liability for any lease with a term of twelve months or less. The most significant impact of adopting the standard was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases on the Company's consolidated balance sheet but it did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company did not have a cumulative effect on adoption prior to January 1, 2019. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), Disclosure Framework Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The amendments in this Update modify certain disclosure requirements of fair value measurements and are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently unable to determine the impact on its financial statements of the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement. In June 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. An entity should apply the requirements of Topic 718 to nonemployee awards except for specific guidance on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost (that is, the period of time over which share-based payment awards vest and the pattern of cost recognition over that period). The new guidance is effective for all entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 . The amendment provides guidance on accounting for the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act and allows entities to complete the accounting under ASC 740 within a one-year measurement period from the Tax Act enactment date. This standard is effective upon issuance. The Tax Act has several significant changes that impact all taxpayers, including a transition tax, which is a one-time tax charge on accumulated, undistributed foreign earnings. The calculation of accumulated foreign earnings requires an analysis of each foreign entity s financial results going back to 1986. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income . The guidance permits entities to reclassify tax effects stranded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as a result of tax reform to retained earnings. This new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted in annual and interim periods and can be applied retrospectively or in the period of adoption. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 27 Table of Contents In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): I. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features; II. Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests with a Scope Exception. Part I of this update addresses the complexity of accounting for certain financial instruments with down round features. Down round features are features of certain equity-linked instruments (or embedded features) that result in the strike price being reduced on the basis of the pricing of future equity offerings. Current accounting guidance creates cost and complexity for entities that issue financial instruments (such as warrants and convertible instruments) with down round features that require fair value measurement of the entire instrument or conversion option. Part II of this update addresses the difficulty of navigating Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, because of the existence of extensive pending content in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This pending content is the result of the indefinite deferral of accounting requirements about mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of certain nonpublic entities and certain mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests. The amendments in Part II of this update do not have an accounting effect. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently unable to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements of the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting , which clarifies when a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as a modification. The new guidance requires modification accounting if the fair value, vesting condition or the classification of the award is not the same immediately before and after a change to the terms and conditions of the award. The new guidance is effective for all entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-4, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): "Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This update simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Instead, under the amendments in this update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. An entity should apply the amendments in this update on a prospective basis. An entity is required to disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle upon transition. That disclosure should be provided in the first annual period and in the interim period within the first annual period when the entity initially adopts the amendments in this update. A public business entity that is an SEC filer should adopt the amendments in this Update for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently unable to determine the impact on its financial statements of the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-1, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. The amendments in this update clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The amendments of this ASU are effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments in this Update are to be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. The Company is currently unable to determine the impact on its financial statements of the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement. Item 7A.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 28 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lithium Corporation Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Lithium Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has negative cash flows from operations for the year which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding those matters are discussed in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Black Scholes Calculations As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company utilizes Black Scholes calculations to determine fair value of the Company s stock options. Auditing management s calculations of fair value of stock options involves significant judgements and estimates to determine the proper value. Volatility and term are the major assumptions used by management in determining the value of the stock options. To evaluate the appropriateness of fair value calculation, we evaluated management s significant judgements and estimates in what inputs were utilized within the Black Scholes calculations. Additionally, we evaluated management s disclosure of the Black Scholes calculations in Note 7 of the financial statements. /s/ M K CPAS, PLLC We have served as the Company s auditor since 2016.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure There were no disagreements related to accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, internal controls or auditing scope or procedure during the two fiscal years and interim periods. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify the Company s financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. Based on their evaluation, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were ineffective as of December 31, 2022 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Our officers also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of control procedures. The objectives of internal control include providing management with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that transactions are executed in accordance with management s authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework , as published in 1992. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) 2013 Framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on this evaluation, management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, our management determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below: There is a lack of accounting personnel with the requisite knowledge of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the US GAAP and the financial reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission; There are insufficient written policies and procedures to ensure the correct application of accounting and financial reporting with respect to the current requirements of GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and There is a lack of segregation of duties, in that we only had one person performing all accounting-related duties. The Company did not establish a formal written policy for the approval, identification and authorization of related party transactions. 42 Table of Contents Our management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the existence of these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our management believes that the financial statements included in its reports fairly present in all material respects our company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit our company to provide only management s report in this annual report. Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2021 that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Executive officers, directors and greater than 10 shareholders are required by the SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by our company, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Form 5s were required for those persons, we believe that, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, all filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners as well as our officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners of our subsidiaries were complied with, with the exception of the following: Name Number of Late Reports Number of Transactions Not Reported on a Timely Basis Failure to File Requested Forms Brian Goss (1) 1 1 0 (1) The insider was late filing a Form 4, Statement of Changes of Beneficial Ownership. Code of Ethics Effective March 25, 2011, our company s board of directors adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to, among other persons, our company s principal executive officer and our principal financial and accounting officer, as well as persons performing similar functions. As adopted, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics sets forth written standards that are designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote: 1. honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; 2. full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that we file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made by us; 3. compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations; 4. the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; and 5. accountability for adherence to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires, among other things, that all of our company s personnel shall be accorded full access to our president and secretary with respect to any matter which may arise relating to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Further, all of our company s personnel are to be accorded full access to our company s board of directors if any such matter involves an alleged breach of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by our president or secretary. 46 Table of Contents In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes that all employees, and particularly managers and/or supervisors, have a responsibility for maintaining financial integrity within our company, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, and federal, provincial and state securities laws. Any employee who becomes aware of any incidents involving financial or accounting manipulation or other irregularities, whether by witnessing the incident or being told of it, must report it to his or her immediate supervisor or to our company s president or secretary. If the incident involves an alleged breach of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by the president or secretary, the incident must be reported to any member of our board of directors. Any failure to report such inappropriate or irregular conduct of others is to be treated as a severe disciplinary matter. It is against our company policy to retaliate against any individual who reports in good faith the violation or potential violation of our company s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by another. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics was attached as an exhibit to our annual report filed on Form 10-K with the SEC on April 15, 2013. We will provide a copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to any person without charge, upon request. Requests can be sent to: Lithium Corporation, 1031 Railroad St, Suite 102B., Elko, Nevada 89801. Board and Committee Meetings Our board of directors held no formal meetings during the year ended December 31, 2022. All proceedings of the board of directors were conducted by resolutions consented to in writing by all the directors and filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the directors. Such resolutions consented to in writing by the directors entitled to vote on that resolution at a meeting of the directors are, according to the Nevada General Corporate Law and our Bylaws, as valid and effective as if they had been passed at a meeting of the directors duly called and held. Nomination Process As of December 31, 2022, we did not effect any material changes to the procedures by which our shareholders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. Our board of directors does not have a policy with regards to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by our shareholders. Our board of directors has determined that it is in the best position to evaluate our company s requirements as well as the qualifications of each candidate when the board considers a nominee for a position on our board of directors. If shareholders wish to recommend candidates directly to our board, they may do so by sending communications to the president of our company at the address on the cover of this annual report.

Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided.
