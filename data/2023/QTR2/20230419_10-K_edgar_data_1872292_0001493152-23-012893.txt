Background 

Rainmaker
Worldwide Inc. RAKR , the Company , we , us or our is a Nevada corporation
originally formed on February 27, 1998. The corporation became RAKR on July 3, 2017 in a reverse merger. 

Rainmaker
Worldwide Inc. (Ontario) RWI ), an Ontario Corporation, was formed in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada on July 21, 2014, under
the Ontario Business Corporations Act to finance and commercialize patented technology and to consolidate the assets, intellectual property,
and executive management expertise of Dutch Rainmaker B.V. DRM ). RWI is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. DRM
was originally started by Piet Oosterling as a technology company focused on delivering decentralized water solutions to water scarce
regions in the world. In his lifetime, Mr. Oosterling wrote and commercialized over 400 patents. His wealth of knowledge and expertise
continues to inspire and guide the Company s executive management team and policy. 

On
July 3, 2017, RWI shareholders completed a share exchange with the Company (the Merger pursuant to a share exchange agreement
dated June 28, 2017 (the Share Exchange Agreement among the Company, RWI and RWI s 45 shareholders at the time.
Upon completion of the Merger, and in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired
an aggregate of 9,029,562 common shares of stock in the capital of RWI from the RWI Shareholders (being all of the issued and outstanding
shares of RWI) in exchange for an aggregate of 66,818,759 restricted shares of the Company s common stock, or 7.4 shares for each
share of RWI. Therefore, RWI became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company effective July 3, 2017. The Company s former name,
Gold and Silver Mining of Nevada, Inc. CJT was changed on April 24, 2017, in expectation of and conditional upon completion
of the Merger. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with RWI considered the accounting acquirer since the former RWI
shareholders remained in control of the combined entity after the consummation of the transaction. As part of the Merger, net liabilities
of 235,495 were recognized on the Company s balance sheet. As a result of the Merger, the Company traded on the OTC Pink, but
as of March 17, 2022 the Company now trades on the OTCQB continuing to trade under the symbol, RAKR. 

On
July 15, 2020, Sphere 3D Corp. (NASDAQ: ANY) announced that it entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which it would
have acquired all the outstanding securities of Rainmaker Worldwide Inc. Upon closing, Sphere 3D s name would have changed to Rainmaker
Worldwide Inc., and its business model would focus on WaaS. Rainmaker management would have assumed operational leadership of the combined
entity. The transaction was subject to completion of an equity financing, or series of financings, for a minimum of US 15 million at
a share price to be mutually agreed prior to closing and such other customary regulatory and shareholder approvals, including the approval
of NASDAQ. Closing was originally expected to occur prior to December 31, 2020, but was subject to extension to February 28, 2021, under
certain circumstances if mutually agreed by the parties. As part of this process, Sphere 3D agreed to advance US 1.85 million to Rainmaker
by way of a secured convertible note for Rainmaker to sustain multiple growth initiatives. The funds were used to fulfill recent contracts
and expand its equipment production capacity. This note remains payable and is presented in RAKR s financial statements. Due to
various transactional and regulatory complications the agreement was ultimately terminated on February 12, 2021 and was subsequently
announced publicly. 

As
a result of the incomplete Sphere 3D transaction, on March 31, 2021, the Company, including RWI, entered into a business agreement with
RHBV, DRM and Wind en Water Technologie Holding B.V. WWT ). These companies were considered related parties on that date
by virtue of stock ownership exceeding 10 . The parties agreed to an exchange of contractual obligations, debt owed, and shares of common
stock in full settlement of all obligations among the parties. The resultant Financial Statements, in accordance with ASC 205-20-45-1E,
reflect the impact of these exchanges to the Company. The Company and RHBV decided to restructure in order to optimize business operations
and broaden access to the capital markets. The Company and RHBV, as mutual shareholders in each other s company, continue to pursue
the mission and objective of providing low-cost water to communities and commercial entities in need of water solutions. The Company
retains a 12 ownership stake in RHBV. RAKR retains access to the technology based on a cost-plus formula. 

3 

The
Company will utilize two main types of energy-efficient, fresh water-producing/purification technologies: (1) Air-to-Water AW ),
which harvests fresh water from humidity and heat in the atmosphere, and (2) Water-to-Water WW ), which transforms seawater
or polluted water into drinking water. The technologies can be wind driven, solar based, or can use conventional power sources, such
as grid or generator. It is deployable anywhere and leaves no carbon trace if renewable resources are deployed. 

The
Company has generated limited revenue up until the present time, and its operations for the past four years have been typically focused
on business development, market research, technology research and development activities. The Company, on a consolidated basis, had total
assets of 344,341, as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, net assets were 43,038, reflecting the impact of restructuring
in connection with the previously held RHBV. The ultimate effect of the restructuring eliminated 2,958,497 in debt, which we believe
will aid us in facilitating the future expected financing needs of the Company. Furthermore, 20,238,606 shares of common stock were returned
to the corporate treasury in exchange for the cancelation of royalty agreements and all obligations therein. 

At
present, the Company executes consulting agreements with experienced executive personnel and senior advisors. Sales are heavily
driven by independent distributors and project developers. The Company had no revenue for the years ending December 31, 2022 and
2021 and had net losses of 1,837,611 and 2,725,464 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A large
proportion of the 2021 losses relate to uncustomary expenses associated with the restructuring 467,118 amortization of debt
discount and non-recurring consultancy expenses of 587,500 as well as losses from equity investments 112,000) and write-down of
inventory 219,701)). The losses associated with discontinued operations 333,733) are not expected to reoccur in future years.
The total of these expense categories is 1,720,052 or 63.1 of the net loss. The losses in 2022 have been reduced by 33 compared
to 2021. The 2022 losses are driven by operating expenses, the first important component being the cost associated with maintaining
the Company s listing and current filing status with the SEC. The second component is consulting expenses including stock option expenses which incorporate derivative liabilities for warrants, the majority of
which remains on the balance sheet as related party payables. The Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, negative
cash flows from operating activities and has limited resources or revenues to cover its operating costs. Due to a lack of sales, a
review of the inventory required that it be fully impaired at December 31, 2023 which amounted to 335,000 of the 2022 losses. The
Company still plans to sell the inventory and if successful will report according to US GAAP. The Company s auditor s
report for 2022 stated that there was substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Impact
of COVID-19 

On
March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic. 

As
a global corporation the economic effects within the Company s environment were substantial and there are still lingering economic
impacts globally. In global markets, disruptions in supply chains and increases in related costs have had a real impact on our ability
to deliver projects. Measures being introduced at various levels of government to curtail the spread of the virus (such as travel restrictions,
closures of non-essential municipal and private operations, imposition of quarantines and social distancing) had a material impact on
the Company s operations. The extent of the impact of this outbreak and related containment measures on the Company s operations
cannot be reliably estimated at this time but at the same time the impact has been significant since the declaration of the pandemic
three years ago. For the Company, it was particularly disruptive because of limitations on our business development and engineering experts
to travel and implement projects. As global operations have recently become more open, we have begun reopening our connections with distributors
to deliver products to market. 

Products
and Services 

Overview 

Across
the world, fresh water is unevenly distributed. Many regions are desperately under-served, including North Africa, the Middle East, India,
Mexico, large portions of South America, and various island geographies. 

Fundamentally,
the Company s solutions are based on deploying technology with the following attributes to ensure low-cost delivery and Company
profitability: 

Versatile 

Scalable
 Cost-effective 

Environmentally
 Socially Sustainable 

Applying
 Proprietary Technology through partners and affiliates 

Air-to-Water
(AW) Harvests fresh water from airborne humidity by using advanced heating and cooling technologies 

Water-to-Water
(WW) Transforms contaminated water (saltwater, sewage, polluted) into safe, clean water by using an environmentally sustainable
process called Multi-Effect Membrane Distillation. 

4 

The
operating efficiency of these technologies allows us to provide customers with clean water at a price that is highly competitive relative
to traditional alternatives. We substantially out-perform peer competitors because we can deploy remotely where the water is consumed
and using up to 50 less power than those same competitors. The compact and scalable systems for AW and WW enable decentralized deployment,
in which water is distributed directly to the consumption site with no expensive piping or truck transport. AW and WW are both cost-effective
technology solutions and can be powered by solar, wind, or grid electricity, or a combination of power sources. They can produce roughly
5,000 to 150,000 liters of water per unit, per day, depending on the local conditions and the type of unit deployed. 

Cost
Information 

Currently
in remote locations, the principal source of supply is bottled water. Accordingly, our solutions are optimally profitable when we compete
head-to-head with bottled water that is transported or bulk water that is transported by truck to local communities. In most remote communities
where this water is imported, the minimum cost per liter is US 0.30 reaching as high as US 2.00, according to our market research. The
Company s fully amortized cost of water per liter including, bottling, operating and maintenance, distribution and other costs
allows us to compete profitably to generate corporate value beneficial to our shareholders. The market for distilled water supported
in part by WW-based technology, which is essential to more specialized industrial or commercial activities, is expected to increase margins
significantly. 

Business
Model 

The
RAKR business model typically begins with the identification of a trusted local partner. When applicable, the next step is to enter into
JV structures, which maximize value to all stakeholder-parties. The Rainmaker delivery systems are to be installed by entering into contracts
with local third-party experts that are typically Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning HVAC experts. 

In
addition, over the course of the past year, we have been developing partnerships with highly experienced developers of complementary
technology. That gives RAKR the ability to have a more comprehensive product set when proposing solutions to communities, developers
and commercial entities. The most significant agreement to date is with Miranda Environmental and Water Treatment Technologies, Energy,
Natural Resources, Engineering, Consulting, Construction and Commerce Inc. Miranda ). 

On
July 28, 2022, the Company signed a Joint Development Agreement JDA with Miranda whose primary manufacturing operations
reside in Ankara, Turkey. This JDA allows for reciprocal distribution rights for all of RAKR and Miranda s combined technologies
and fosters a long-term technological integration strategy between the two companies. They have been delivering systems for more than
ten years across 40 countries globally. As a result, their global experience in invaluable to Rainmaker and Rainmaker shareholders. 

On
October 5, 2022, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the MOU with Miranda to formalize the mutual
intention to integrate the two firms at both strategic and operating levels. This was a non-binding agreement allowing for standard
due diligence to take place before the creation of definitive agreements. The MOU was renewed on March 21, 2023 and will remain in
force until May 30, 2023. There can be no assurance that the parties will reach a definitive agreement. 

Regulatory
Information 

The
global nature of our approach means that regulatory conditions vary by jurisdiction. We believe that the ultimate test of profitability
in this complex, cross-jurisdictional environment will be the quality of the water that is bottled and tested. The Company seeks to adhere
to World Health Organization standards for clean water using the technologies that are authorized in a particular sovereign jurisdiction. 

5 

Potential
Improvements 

Potential
improvements and related applications that we are pursuing or plan to pursue include seeking more strategic and technology-based partnerships
with complementary technology and business development companies to expand our global reach and service offering. 

Market
Opportunity 

In
the past ten years, there has been a growing awareness of the shortage of fresh water and the associated economic and social effects
the problem magnifies in impoverished and underdeveloped communities. Entities ranging from Water.Org to the United Nations (access to
safe drinking water represents #6 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals articulated by the United Nations) are at the forefront of
driving international policy momentum and prospects for multilateral cooperation in the realms of global governance and public-private
co-regulation. Common to these efforts is the search for scalable and practical solutions that possess applications uniquely suited to
the problem of shortage. 

The
metrics that underpin the international need for ingenuity and action are the same as those that animate and sustain the market opportunity
for our Company: 

(1) 
 Less
 than 3 of the world s water is fresh the rest is seawater and undrinkable in its current state. 

(2) 
 Of
 this 3 , over 2.5 is frozen and locked up in Antarctica, the Arctic and glaciers. 

(3) 
 People
 and animals rely on 0.5 of the world s water. (Source: Unwater.org - Facts and Trends: Water) 

Moreover,
at any moment, the atmosphere contains approximately 37.5 million billion gallons of water. This potential is not currently harvested
by the means of private organizations or government institutions and thus presents a significant opportunity for AW technology to satisfy
worldwide demand for water. 

The
World Health Organization estimates that 50 liters of water per day is required per individual to meet basic needs. It is estimated by
the OECD that by 2030 nearly half of humanity will be living in a condition of severe water stress. Currently, according to UNICEF, 2.2
billion people around the globe lack safe drinking water. While high-income countries only treat 70 of wastewater, low-income countries
treat 8 . With the world s population expected to reach 9 billion by 2038, the global need is indisputably high. Much of the population
expansion is or will be in the very areas that are already suffering from the problem of water scarcity. 

The
above analysis points to a global market for water that is extraordinarily immense. Today, the annual global water market for all purposes
and uses is 650 billion and is expected to expand to 1 trillion by 2025. (Source: RobecoSAM Study (2015, June). Water: the market of
the future). Applying RAKR s approach against the purposes and uses defined above, our solutions are tailored to meet roughly 70 
of that global level of demand. 

Suppliers 

As
stated previously, our principal supplier for the core technologies to be deployed is RHBV. RHBV in turn has built a global supply chain
for its components. Should RHBV not supply the appropriate scale of technology required by a project, RAKR has identified multiple technologies
of different sizes and types. 

We
also have suppliers of complementary technology that we expect to be delivering in 2023 to diversify the Rainmaker business model. Complementary
and supplemental technology (i.e., bottling, pre-post wastewater treatment, mineralization solutions, and renewable energy) suppliers
are global, abundant, and highly competitive so as to ensure the lowest cost per liter. See Business Model in Item 7. 

Competition 

The
Rainmaker business model that will deliver potable water at the source of demand is uniquely positioned to address alternative competitive
models. We believe that competitive models, while relevant and plausible alternatives, will not ultimately fully support the global level
of demand for water at a reasonable price per liter. In virtue of our current affiliations, we believe we have a cost per liter competitive
advantage. Accordingly, on a global basis, we do not believe competitive conditions will thwart our ability to produce long-term, corporate
value or significantly diminish our financial results in the near term. However, other companies with sufficiently greater resources
may develop competing products and have an advantage over us based on the relative size. 

6 

Government
Subsidies and Incentives 

While
RAKR is not currently pursuing subsidies and incentives, we believe that over time such programs will be applicable to the Company, and
we will pursue them in due course. 

Over
time, RAKR will seek subsidies and incentives through its deployment of technology in underserved countries and particular communities
within countries. One example is First Nations in Canada where there is an ongoing and desperate shortage of safe drinkable and general-purpose
water. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
have indirect access to considerable intellectual property assets as a consequence of our partial ownership of and various partnerships
with RHBV. We believe that this allows us to maintain an edge in the competitive process from a technology and economic cost perspective.

Item
 1A. 
 Risk
 Factors 

Investing
in our common stock involves risks. Each of these risks as well as other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we
currently deem immaterial could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and cause the
value of our common shares to decline, which may result in the loss of part or all of your investment. 

Risks
Related to our Business 

RAKR
has a limited commercial operating history, which makes the evaluation of its future business prospects difficult. 

The
Company has recently commercialized its business to deploy its technologies using AW and WW and partner products and services. Consequently,
the Company has limited operating history and an unproven marketing and sales strategy. Our primary activities to date, prior to restructuring
in Q1 2021, have been the research and development of intellectual property and technology assets and identifying prospective global
clients that management believes would operationalize our technologies. As such, we may not be able to achieve positive cash flows and
our lack of operating history makes evaluation of our future business and investment prospects difficult. The Company s success
is dependent upon the successful development and implementation of suitable water projects and establishing its water production technology
capabilities in a variety of complex environmental crises worldwide. Any future success that we might achieve will depend upon various
factors, including factors beyond our control that cannot be predicted at this time. These factors may include but are not limited to: 

weather
 conditions in the areas we serve; 

7 

the
 economies of the countries in which we conduct business; 

our
 relationships with the governments, water utility, and/or companies we serve; 

water
 regulatory matters of the countries in which we conduct business; 

our
 ability to successfully enter new markets; 

changes
 in or increased levels of competition in the water sector; and 

the
 market price of and the uses for water in an international landscape. 

Our
independent registered public accounting firm has issued an unqualified opinion on our financial statements with a going concern 
paragraph. 

Our
independent registered public accounting firm s opinion on our Fiscal 2022 financial statements has a going concern 
explanatory paragraph. Such an opinion may make parties reluctant to extend trade credit to us or raise capital and thereby make it more
difficult for us to conduct our business operations. In addition, such an opinion from the independent registered public accounting firm
may also make third parties reluctant to do business with us or to invest funds in our company, thereby raising difficulties for us in
the conduct of our business. 

Relatively
new to commercialization, the Company is unable to predict future revenues which makes an evaluation of its business speculative. 

Because
of the Company s current business focus, lack of operating history, early-stage marketing strategy, its ability to accurately forecast
revenues is difficult. Future variables to the Company s strategy are related to the market for water itself; the price of water
in international markets; and the creation and maintenance of a significant and reliable customer base. To the extent we are unsuccessful
in establishing our business strategy and generating revenues, we may be unable to appropriately adjust spending in a timely manner to
compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall or will have to reduce our operating expenses, causing us to forego potential revenue-generating
activities, either of which could have a material adverse effect in our business, results of operations, and overall financial condition. 

RAKR
expects its operating expenses to increase in the future with no assurance that revenues will be sufficient to cover those expenses,
which could delay or prevent RAKR from achieving profitability. 

As
our business grows and expands, RAKR expects to have substantial planned expenses in order to facilitate and maintain strategic distribution
channels and key relationships. We expect our cost of revenues, business development, marketing, sales, operational, general, and administrative
expenses to continue to increase. If revenues do not increase to correspond with these increased expenses or if outside capital is not
secured, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, and overall financial condition. 

If
the Company fails to raise additional external capital to fund its business growth and project development, the Company s business
could fail. We anticipate the need for significant amounts of financial capital to meet the needs of the Company. The Company will attempt
to raise such funds through the future issuance of stock or debt instruments in the capital markets. However, there is no assurance that
we will be successful in raising sufficient additional capital, and there can be no assurance that external financing will be available
to us. If adequate funds are unavailable or unavailable on acceptable terms, our ability to fund the Company s marketing and sales
efforts, global projects, potential expenditures in relation to strategic opportunities, and possible corporate responses to existing
or unexpected competitive pressures would be significantly limited. Such limitation could have a material adverse effect on our business
and overall financial condition. 

Raising
funds through debt or equity financings in the future, would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and possibly subordinate
certain rights to the rights of new investors or creditors. 

We
expect to raise additional funds by engaging in equity and/or debt financing transactions if capital providers supply the desired amount
of financial capital on the basis of terms we believe reasonable to provide for working capital needs, finance the acquisition of capital
assets, and carry out business development efforts in the best interest of existing shareholders. Any sales of additional equity and/or
convertible debt securities would result in dilution of the equity interests of our existing stockholders, which could be substantial.
Additionally, if we issue shares of preferred stock or convertible debt to raise funds, the holders of those securities might be entitled
to various preferential rights over the holders of our Common Stock, including repayment of their investment, and possibly additional
amounts, before any payments could be made to holders of our Common Stock in connection with an acquisition of the Company. Incurring
additional debt, if authorized, would create rights and preferences that would be senior to, or otherwise adversely affect, the rights
and the value of our Common Stock and would have to be repaid from future cash flow before there would be any return to investors. Since
2017, no stock issuances have held such preferential rights. On June 29, 2022 the Company increased its authorized capital to 500,000,000
and established one million preferred shares none of which have been issued to date. 

8 

Our
business will depend on certain key RAKR personnel and suppliers, the loss of which would adversely affect our chances of financial success. 

The
Company s success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of its senior management, key executives and consultants.
We do not have key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or other employees. The loss of the services of
any key members of senior management, and other key personnel, or our inability to retain high quality subcontractors and/or suppliers
would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. 

Management
may be unable to implement our Business Strategy. 

The
Company s business strategy is to commercialize our technologies that management believes may have significant humanitarian and
commercial application, thereby effecting corporate value for the benefit of equity holders. The Company s business strategy includes
developing a global marketing and sales network, and there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and/or develop
commercial partners for our products. In addition, even if we identify and/or develop commercial partners, distributors, and/or JVs,
the time and cost of developing these relationships or otherwise obtaining local permits and guidelines, may exceed our expectations,
or, when developed, the amount of water available may fall significantly short of expectations, which may provide a lower return on investment
or a loss to the Company. 

We
have a limited customer base and network of distribution partners. 

During
the past year we have entered into various discussions with international partners, distributors, and agents that are prepared to deploy
our technologies. Nonetheless, we have not yet established a significant customer base. While we believe our projects will have a significant
impact on global water markets, and, as a result, reflect positively on the Company s performance, an inability to attract customers
and/or an incapacity to deliver our projects in a timely and cost-effective manner would have an adverse effect on our potential revenues
from and growth of our business. 

Water
is a highly regulated industry. 

Water
is subject to extensive regulation by country, state and municipal regulatory authorities. Federal and state statutes regulate quality
standards, safety, handling procedures, and other environmental protection controls as well as the rights of end users. We will strive
to verify that our water quality will comply with all known safety and environmental standards and regulations applicable to such countries
in which we are conducting business. We have extensive in-house knowledge of World Health Organization water quality standards, and we
will seek local partners who we believe are operating in best-efforts compliance with all safety and environmental standards and regulations
applicable to delivering water to the end consumers. However, there can be no assurance that our compliance efforts could be challenged
or that future changes in federal, state and/or municipal laws, regulations or interpretations thereof will not have a material adverse
effect on our ability to establish and sustain operations or adversely affect the operations of our partners. 

The
technology we decide to deploy may require certifications before being deployed in certain global territories. 

The
technology we use to deploy may require certain certifications before being implemented in certain international territories. For example,
in the case of the United States our deployed technology must be certified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, under
the Safe Drinking Water Act SDWA to meet certain standards in order to be certified for use in large government projects.
While the technology expected to be deployed by the Company is certified in certain territories, there is no assurance as to if and/or
when such certifications will be obtained in new territories we are expecting to enter and sell into. Supplemental technologies 
bottling, mineralization and pre-post treatment will be chosen only if they have already been certified. 

9 

We
are exposed to risks in connection with legal liability claims associated with water quality in the event that the water delivered results
in injury or damage. 

If
a consumer of our produced or purified water was ill affected from a health perspective by the water quality the Company could be exposed
to legal liability. The Company in all cases will use every tool necessary and practically available to limit any such risk. 

We
face competition in our market space. 

The
competition in AW and WW technology is limited. Until recently, smaller remote on-site solutions have not been cost-competitive compared
to alternatives, but that has changed. At the present time, we are aware of other companies that produce AW and/or WW technologies. To
the extent that future technological advance in the market results in pricing pressures, and the possibility that that will affect the
Company s ability to increase its market share, we may face an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and overall financial
condition. At such time, the Company will consider its technological options accordingly. 

We
will incur increased costs and may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified directors and executive officers as a result of
becoming a public company. 

RAKR
has become a public reporting company with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). As a public reporting
company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, reporting and other expenses not generally applicable to a private company. We
also will incur costs associated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
as well as other rules implemented by the SEC. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs
and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We also expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and
more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and
coverage. As a result, we may experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors
or as executive officers. 

A
significant number of the Company s outstanding shares remain with resale restrictions however we have 175,185,072 (71.1 shares in the public float. 

The
shares of the Company s common stock issued in the 2017 were issued and designated as restricted or control 
shares as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act and are subject to resale restrictions. Consequently, these shares were not able
to be freely sold at the time unless registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or sold pursuant to an available exemption under Rule
144. As of April 12, 2023, approximately 175,185,072 shares of the Company s common stock, held by non-affiliate stockholders are
eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 without resale restrictions. This represents approximately 71.1 of the total issued and outstanding
shares of stock. While this remains a risk factor the number of shareholders and the percent of tradeable shares suggest a functioning
market for the Company s shares. 

Inadequate
market liquidity may make it difficult to sell our stock. 

There
is currently a public market for our common stock with volumes that have been variable over time, and we can give no assurance that there
will always be a market with substantial liquidity, nor can we give assurance that the market for our stock will develop sufficiently
to create significant market liquidity and/or stable market prices in the future. A stockholder may find it difficult or impossible to
sell shares of our common stock in the public market because of the limited number of potential buyers at any time and/or because of
fluctuations in our market price. In addition, the shares of our common stock are not eligible as a margin security, and lending institutions
may not accept our common stock as collateral for a loan. 

10 

We
do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future, which may reduce the return on your investment in our common stock. 

To
date, the Company has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying any such dividends in the foreseeable
future. Payment of future dividends will depend on earnings and our capital requirements and our debt facilities and other factors considered
appropriate by our Executive Officers and Directors. There is no assurance that we will, at any time, generate sufficient profits or
surplus cash that would be available for distribution as a dividend to the holders of our common stock. Our current plans are to use
any profits that we may generate to fund our ongoing marketing, sales, and operations. Therefore, any return on your investment would
be derived from an increase in the price of our stock, which may or may not occur. 

There
is an active but variable trading market for our common stock making our stock vulnerable to significant price and volume fluctuations. 

There
is currently an active trading market for our common stock, which is quoted and traded on the OTCQB. The OTC is not a listing service
or exchange but is instead a dealer quotation service for subscribing members. Consequently, the market for our common stock will depend
to a certain extent on the number of market makers trading in our stock. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected
by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, the activities of our market makers, general market conditions,
and other factors. In addition, stock markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have
particularly affected the market prices of the shares of development stage companies such as Rainmaker, which may adversely affect the
market price of our common stock in a material manner. Rainmaker is no exception and has recently experienced very high volumes and the
adverse negative effects of aggressive short sellers in the market for RAKR common stock. As a result, the share price as of April 15,
2023, is less than 0.01 which could, if not rectified, means RAKR will return to the OTC Pink. Executives are exploring all options
to cure the situation. 

In
addition, the financial markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations from time to time in the recent past. The market prices
of securities in the water industry have been relatively stable compared to other sectors. The sale or attempted sale of a large amount
of common stock into the market may also have a significant impact on the trading price of our common stock. Many of these factors are
beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.

appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis and the audited financial statements
included in our Form 10-12GA. In addition, we intend to use our media and investor section on our website (www.rainmakerww.com/category/investor-updates/),
SEC filings and press releases to communicate with the public about Rainmaker, its services and other issues. 

Overview 

Rainmaker
Worldwide Inc. RAKR , the Company , we , us or our is a Nevada corporation
originally formed on February 27, 1998. The corporation became RAKR on July 3, 2017 in a reverse merger. We are currently developing
projects in various locations around the globe using RAKR and partner technologies. We are implementing these projects using proprietary
technology of our former subsidiary based in the Netherlands, Rainmaker Holland B.V. RHBV ). The Company retains a 12 
ownership stake in RHBV. RAKR retains access to the technology based on a cost-plus formula. 

Rainmaker
Worldwide Inc. (Ontario) RWI ), an Ontario Corporation, was formed in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada on July 21, 2014, under
the Ontario Business Corporations Act to finance and commercialize patented technology and to consolidate the assets, intellectual property,
and executive management expertise of Dutch Rainmaker B.V. DRM ). RWI is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. DRM
was originally started by Piet Oosterling as a technology company focused on delivering decentralized water solutions to water scarce
regions in the world. In his lifetime, Mr. Oosterling wrote and commercialized over 400 patents. His wealth of knowledge and expertise
continues to inspire and guide the Company s executive management team and policy. 

On
July 3, 2017, RWI shareholders completed a share exchange with the Company (the Merger pursuant to a share exchange agreement
dated June 28, 2017 (the Share Exchange Agreement among the Company, RWI and RWI s 45 shareholders at the time.
Upon completion of the Merger, and in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired
an aggregate of 9,029,562 common shares of stock in the capital of RWI from the RWI Shareholders (being all the issued and outstanding
shares of RWI) in exchange for an aggregate of 66,818,759 restricted shares of the Company s common stock, or 7.4 shares for each
share of RWI. Therefore, RWI became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company effective July 3, 2017. The Company s former name,
Gold and Silver Mining of Nevada, Inc. CJT was changed on April 24, 2017, in expectation of and conditional upon completion
of the Merger. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with RWI considered the accounting acquirer since the former RWI
shareholders remained in control of the combined entity after the consummation of the transaction. As part of the Merger, net liabilities
of 235,495 were recognized on the Company s balance sheet. As a result of the Merger, the Company traded on the OTC Pink, but
as of March 17, 2022 the Company now trades on the OTCQB continuing to trade under the symbol, RAKR. 

13 

On
July 15, 2020, Sphere 3D Corp. (NASDAQ: ANY) announced that it entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which it would
have acquired all the outstanding securities of Rainmaker Worldwide Inc. Upon closing, Sphere 3D s name would have changed to Rainmaker
Worldwide Inc., and its business model would have focused on WaaS . Rainmaker management would have assumed operational
leadership of the combined entity. The agreement was ultimately terminated on February 12, 2021 and was subsequently announced publicly. 

As
a result of the incomplete Sphere 3D transaction, on March 31, 2021, the Company, including RWI, entered into a business agreement with
RHBV, DRM and Wind en Water Technologie Holding B.V. WWT ). These companies were considered related parties on that date
by virtue of stock ownership exceeding 10 . The parties agreed to an exchange of contractual obligations, debt owed, and shares of common
stock in full settlement of all obligations among the parties. The resultant Financial Statements, in accordance with ASC 205-20-45-1E,
reflect the impact of these exchanges to the Company. The Company and RHBV decided to restructure in order to optimize business operations
and broaden access to the capital markets. The Company and RHBV, as mutual shareholders in each other s company, continue to pursue
the mission and objective of providing low-cost water to communities and commercial entities in need of water solutions. The Company
retains a 12 ownership stake in RHBV. RAKR retains access to the technology based on a cost-plus formula. 

The
Company is based in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. The Company will utilize two main types of energy-efficient, fresh water-producing/purification
technologies: (1) Air-to-Water AW ), which harvests fresh water from humidity and heat in the atmosphere, and (2) Water-to-Water WW ), which transforms seawater or polluted water into drinking water. The technologies can be wind driven, solar based,
or can use conventional power sources, such as grid or generator. It is deployable anywhere and leaves no carbon trace if renewable resources
are deployed. 

The
Company s current and ongoing focus is to use the two Rainmaker technologies discussed above or other complementary technologies
acquired or licensed by the Company. This focus shall be administered by forming joint venture partnerships JV ). In most
if not all cases, RAKR expects to have ownership stakes in JVs. Ownership percentages will typically be determined by the relative contribution
of the stakeholders. 

In
the Caribbean, locations have been identified and operating plans defined. We have an AW machine being tested in the Netherlands and
expect delivery by Q3 2023. Specifically, locations have been identified and operating plans defined for various locations. 

The
Company has generated no revenue up until the present time, and its operations for the past four years have been typically focused on
business development, market research, technology research and development activities. The Company, on a consolidated basis, had total
assets of 43,038 as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, net assets were 344,341, reflecting the impact of restructuring
in connection with the previously held RHBV. The ultimate effect of the restructuring has eliminated 2,958,497 in debt, which we believe
will aid us in facilitating the future expected financing needs of the Company. Furthermore, 20,238,606 shares of common stock were returned
to the corporate treasury in exchange for the cancelation of royalty agreements and all obligations therein. 

At
present, the Company executes consulting agreements with experienced executive personnel and senior advisors. Sales are heavily
driven by independent distributors and project developers. The Company had no revenue for the years ending December 31, 2022 and
2021 and had net losses of 1,837,611 and 2,725,464 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A large
proportion of the 2021 losses relate to uncustomary expenses associated with the restructuring 467,118 amortization of debt
discount and non-recurring consultancy expenses of 587,500) as well as losses from equity investments 112,000) and write-down of
inventory 219,701)). The losses associated with discontinued operations 333,733) are not expected to reoccur in future years.
The total of these expense categories is 1,720,052 or 63.1 . of the net loss. The losses in 2022 have been reduced by 33 compared
to 2021. The 2022 losses are driven by operating expenses, the first important component being the cost associated with maintaining
the Company s listing and current filing status with the SEC. The second component is consulting expenses including stock option expenses which incorporate derivative liabilities
for warrants, the majority of
which remains on the balance sheet as related party payables. The Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, negative
cash flows from operating activities and has limited resources or revenues to cover its operating costs. Due to a lack of sales, a
review of the inventory required that it be fully impaired at December 31, 2023 which amounted to 335,000 of the 2022 losses. The
Company still plans to sell the inventory and if successful will report according to US GAAP. The Company s auditor s
report for 2022 stated that there was substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

On
June 29, 2022, the Company held a Special Meeting of Stockholders that confirmed majority vote was achieved. Each share of the Company s
common stock was entitled to one vote per share. The matter voted upon and the results are set forth below. The Proposal presented: Increase
in Authorized Shares and Establishment of Preferred shares. Stockholders approved an increase in the Company s authorized common
stock to 500,000,000 and the establishment of 1,000,000 preferred shares.

Impact
of COVID-19 

On
March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic. 

As
a global corporation the economic effects within the Company s environment were substantial and there are still lingering economic
impacts globally. In global markets, disruptions in supply chains and increases in related costs have had a real impact on our ability
to deliver projects. Measures being introduced at various levels of government to curtail the spread of the virus (such as travel restrictions,
closures of non-essential municipal and private operations, imposition of quarantines and social distancing) had a material impact on
the Company s operations. The extent of the impact of this outbreak and related containment measures on the Company s operations
cannot be reliably estimated at this time but at the same time the impact has been significant since the declaration of the pandemic
three years ago. For the Company, it was particularly disruptive because of limitations on our business development and engineering experts
to travel and implement projects. As global operations have recently become more open, we have begun reopening our connections with distributors
to deliver products to market. 

Products
and Services 

Overview 

Across
the world, fresh water is unevenly distributed. Many regions are desperately under-served, including North Africa, the Middle East, India,
Mexico, large portions of South America, and various island geographies. 

Fundamentally,
our solutions are based on deploying technology with the following attributes to ensure low-cost delivery and Company profitability: 

Versatile 

Scalable
 Cost-effective 

Environmentally
 Socially Sustainable 

Applying
 Proprietary Technology through partners and affiliates 

Air-to-Water
(AW) Harvests fresh water from airborne humidity by using advanced heating and cooling technologies 

Water-to-Water
(WW) Transforms contaminated water (saltwater, sewage, polluted) into safe, clean water by using an environmentally sustainable
process called Multi-Effect Membrane Distillation. 

The
operating efficiency of these technologies allows us to provide customers with clean water at a price that is highly competitive relative
to traditional alternatives. We substantially out-perform peer competitors because we can deploy remotely where the water is consumed
where the water is consumed and using up to 50 less power than those same competitors. The compact and scalable systems for AW and WW
enable decentralized deployment, in which water is distributed directly to the consumption site with no expensive piping or truck transport.
AW and WW are both cost-effective technology solutions and can be powered by solar, wind, or grid electricity, or a combination of power
sources. They can produce roughly 5,000 to 150,000 liters of water per unit, per day, depending on the local conditions and the type
of unit deployed. 

Cost
Information 

Currently
in remote locations, the principal source of supply is bottled water. Accordingly, our solutions are optimally profitable when we compete
head-to-head with bottled water that is transported or bulk water that is transported by truck to local communities. In most remote communities
where this water is imported, the minimum cost per liter is US 0.30 reaching as high as US 2.00, according to our market research. The
Company s fully amortized cost of water per liter including, bottling, operating and maintenance, distribution and other costs
allows us to compete profitably to generate corporate value beneficial to our shareholders. The market for distilled water supported
in part by WW-based technology, which is essential to more specialized industrial or commercial activities, is expected to increase margins
significantly. 

15 

Regulatory
Information 

The
global nature of our approach means that regulatory conditions vary by jurisdiction. We believe that the ultimate test of profitability
in this complex, cross-jurisdictional environment will be the quality of the water that is bottled and tested. The Company seeks to adhere
to World Health Organization standards for clean water using the technologies that are authorized in a particular sovereign jurisdiction. 

Business
Model 

The
RAKR business model typically begins with the identification of a trusted local partner. When applicable, the next step is to enter into
JV structures, which maximize value to all stakeholder-parties. The Rainmaker delivery systems are to be installed by entering into contracts
with local third-party experts that are typically Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning HVAC experts. 

In
addition, over the course of the past year, we have been developing partnerships with highly experienced developers of complementary
technology. That gives RAKR the ability to have a more comprehensive product set when proposing solutions to communities, developers
and commercial entities. The most significant agreement to date is with Miranda Environmental and Water Treatment Technologies, Energy,
Natural Resources, Engineering, Consulting, Construction and Commerce Inc. Miranda ). 

On
July 28, 2022, the Company signed a Joint Development Agreement JDA with Miranda whose primary manufacturing operations
reside in Ankara, Turkey. This JDA allows for reciprocal distribution rights for all of RAKR and Miranda s combined technologies
and fosters a long-term technological integration strategy between the two companies. They have been delivering systems for more than
ten years across 40 countries globally. As a result, their global experience in invaluable to Rainmaker and Rainmaker shareholders. 

On October 5, 2022, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the MOU with Miranda to
formalize the mutual intention to integrate the two firms at both strategic and operating levels. This was a non-binding agreement allowing
for standard due diligence to take place before the creation of definitive agreements. The MOU was renewed on March 21, 2023 and will
remain in force until May 30, 2023. There can be no assurance that the parties will reach a definitive agreement. 

Potential
Improvements 

Potential
improvements and related applications that we are pursuing or plan to pursue include seeking more strategic and technology-based partnerships
with complementary technology and business development companies to expand our global reach and service offering. 

Market
Opportunity 

In
the past ten years, there has been a growing awareness of the shortage of fresh water and the associated economic and social effects
the problem magnifies in impoverished and underdeveloped communities. Entities ranging from Water.Org to the United Nations (access to
safe drinking water represents #6 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals articulated by the United Nations) are at the forefront of
driving international policy momentum and prospects for multilateral cooperation in the realms of global governance and public-private
co-regulation. Common to these efforts is the search for scalable and practical solutions that possess applications uniquely suited to
the problem of shortage. 

 The
metrics that underpin the international need for ingenuity and action are the same as those that animate and sustain the market opportunity
for our Company: 

(1) 
 Less
 than 3 of the world s water is fresh the rest is seawater and undrinkable in its current state. 

(2) 
 Of
 this 3 , over 2.5 is frozen and locked up in Antarctica, the Arctic and glaciers. 

(3) 
 People
 and animals rely on 0.5 of the world s water. (Source: Unwater.org - Facts and Trends: Water) 

16 

Moreover,
at any moment, the atmosphere contains approximately 37.5 million billion gallons of water. This potential is not currently harvested
by the means of private organizations or government institutions and thus presents a significant opportunity for AW technology to satisfy
worldwide demand for water. 

The
World Health Organization estimates that 50 liters of water per day is required per individual to meet basic needs. It is estimated by
the OECD that by 2030 nearly half of humanity will be living in a condition of severe water stress. Currently, according to UNICEF, 2.2
billion people around the globe lack safe drinking water. While high-income countries only treat 70 of wastewater, low-income countries
treat 8 . With the world s population expected to reach 9 billion by 2038, the global need is indisputably high. Much of the population
expansion is or will be in the very areas that are already suffering from the problem of water scarcity. 

The
above analysis points to a global market for water that is extraordinarily immense. Today, the annual global water market for all purposes
and uses is 650 billion and is expected to expand to 1 trillion by 2025. (Source: RobecoSAM Study (2015, June). Water: the market of
the future). Applying RAKR s approach against the purposes and uses defined above, our solutions are tailored to meet roughly 70 
of that global level of demand. 

Suppliers 

As
stated previously, our principal supplier for the core technologies to be deployed is RHBV. RHBV in turn has built a global supply chain
for its components. Should RHBV not supply the appropriate scale of technology required by a project, RAKR has identified multiple technologies
of different sizes and types. 

We
also have suppliers of complementary technology that we expect to be delivering in 2023 to diversify the Rainmaker business model. Complementary
and supplemental technology (i.e., bottling, pre-post wastewater treatment, mineralization solutions, and renewable energy) suppliers
are global, abundant, and highly competitive so as to ensure the lowest cost per liter. 

Competition 

The
Rainmaker business model that will deliver potable water at the source of demand is uniquely positioned to address alternative competitive
models. We believe that competitive models, while relevant and plausible alternatives, will not ultimately fully support the global level
of demand for water at a reasonable price per liter. In virtue of our current affiliations, we believe we have a cost per liter competitive
advantage. Accordingly, on a global basis, we do not believe competitive conditions will thwart our ability to produce long-term, corporate
value or significantly diminish our financial results in the near term. However, other companies with sufficiently greater resources
may develop competing products and have an advantage over us based on the relative size. 

Government
Subsidies and Incentives 

While
RAKR is not currently pursuing subsidies and incentives, we believe that over time such programs will be applicable to the Company, and
we will pursue them in due course. 

Over
time, RAKR will seek subsidies and incentives through its deployment of technology in underserved countries and particular communities
within countries. One example is First Nations in Canada where there is an ongoing and desperate shortage of safe drinkable and general-purpose
water. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
have indirect access to considerable intellectual property assets as a consequence of our partial ownership of and various partnerships
with RHBV. We believe that this allows us to maintain an edge in the competitive process from a technology and economic cost perspective.

decreased 17,273, and (3) rent expense reduced by 12,364 due to the reduction in our commitment of our office lease. These decreases
were offset by the following increases to expense categories; stock-based compensation increased 347,922, general and administrative
expenses increased 194,210 due to the impairment of inventory at December 31, 2022 335,000) and travel 4,676). Excluding stock-based
compensation, general and administrative expenses decreased 349,751 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Management s
Plans 

Similar
to other development stage companies, our products have yet to generate revenue. As a result, we have historically suffered
recurring losses and we do not have required cash resources to fully execute our business plans. However, we have completed the
assembly of three machines, which, after a review for impairment at December 31, 2023, have been removed from inventory. We believe
these machines can be converted into cash flow and will be appropriately reflected under US GAAP at such time as they are
transferred to prospective clients. 

Historically,
the Company s major sources of cash have comprised proceeds from various private offerings of its securities (including common
stock) and debt financings. From 2015 through to the fiscal year end date December 31, 2022, the Company raised approximately 8 million
in gross proceeds from various private offerings of our common stock and convertible debt. These funds were raised during various stages
of the company and allowed us first to develop a commercial ready product and as soon as logistics and supply chains allow, deliver these
products into identified projects and begin to generate revenue. The Company has sustained losses from operations in each fiscal year
since our inception, and we expect losses to continue for the indefinite future. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company
had an accumulated deficit of approximately 73 million and 71 million, respectively, and stockholders equity of approximately
 (10.3) and (8.9) million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 7 thousand in cash. 

The
Company recognizes the need to raise additional capital in order to continue to execute its business plan in the future. There is no
assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or that the Company will be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable
to it or whether the Company will become profitable and generate positive operating cash flow. 

18 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. Management
considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: 

it
 requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and 

changes
 in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have material impact in our results of operations or financial
 condition. 

While
we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material. The most significant estimates impact the following
transactions or account balances: stock compensation. 

See
Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective or Adopted 

Until December 31, 2021, the Company evaluated embedded conversion features
within convertible debt under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging to determine whether the embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated
from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. If the conversion
feature did not require derivative treatment under ASC 815, the instrument was evaluated under ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other
Options for consideration of any beneficial conversion features. On January 1, 2022 the Company adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified
retrospective method and reviewed and calculated the impact on the outstanding financial instruments as of this adoption date concluding
there was no impact.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Based
on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) required
by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15, as of December 31, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer
has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by
us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer also concluded that,
as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We
are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Exchange Act Rule
13a-15. With the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Based on this evaluation,
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022, based on those criteria.
A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following material weaknesses: 

1. 
 As
 of December 31, 2022, due to the inherent issue of segregation of duties in a small company, we have relied heavily on entity or
 management review controls. Accordingly, management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. 

2. 
 As
 of December 31, 2022, we did not establish a formal written policy for the approval, identification, and authorization of related
 party transactions. 

3. 
 During
 the 2022 audit, it was necessary to record adjusting journal entries. Management has determined
 that the effects of the corrected misstatements are material, both individually and in the
 aggregate, to the financial statements as a whole. The corrected misstatements or the matters
 underlying them could potentially cause future period financial statements to be materially
 misstated, even though, in the judgment of our auditor previously, such corrected misstatements
 are material to the financial statements under audit. 
 
 Professional
 standards define an audit adjustment as a proposed correction of the financial statements that, in the judgment of our auditor previously,
 may not have been detected except through the auditing procedures. An audit adjustment may or may not indicate matters that could
 have a significant effect on the Company s financial reporting process (that is, cause future financial statements to be materially
 misstated). In the judgment of our auditor previously, the adjustments proposed indicate matters that could have a significant effect
 on the Company s financial reporting process. 

Because
of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the quarter ended December 31, 2022, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection
with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
management, including our CEO and EVP Finance, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over
financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders
of Rainmaker Worldwide, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rainmaker Worldwide, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for
each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended
December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred continuing net losses from operations and has a significant
accumulated deficit which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding
those matters are discussed in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that
was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are
not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or
disclosures to which they relate. 

Derivative
Liabilities 

As
discussed in Note 4, the Company borrows funds through the use of convertible notes payable that contain a conversion price that may
be fixed or fluctuates with the stock price. 

Auditing
management s estimates of the fair value of the derivative liability involves significant judgements and estimates given the embedded
conversion features of the notes. 

To
evaluate the appropriateness of the fluctuation of the conversion price, the embedded conversion feature requires bifurcation from the
host contract and is recorded as a liability subject to market adjustments as of each reporting period. Significant judgment is exercised
by the Company in determining derivative liability values for these convertible note agreements, including the use of a specialist engaged
by management. 

We
evaluated management s conclusions regarding their derivative liability and reviewed support for the significant inputs used in
the valuation model, as well as assessing the model for reasonableness.

Company has incurred continuing losses from its operations and has an accumulated deficit of . There are no assurances the
Company will be able to raise capital on acceptable terms or that cash flows generated from its operations will be sufficient to meet
its current operating costs and required debt service. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, it
may be required to reduce the scope of its business, which could harm its financial condition and operating results. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue ongoing operations. These consolidated financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

The
Company s ability to continue its operations and to pay its obligations when they become due is contingent upon the Company obtaining
additional financing. Management s plans include seeking to procure additional funds through debt and equity financings to enable
it to meet its operating needs including current and future sales orders.

The
Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making
such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary
differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would
be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred
tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. 

The
Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether
it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for
those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is
more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. 

Income
tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted by the date of the statement of financial position. 

Fair
value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or
liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the inputs in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level
1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level
2 - Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. 

Level
3 - Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by market data. 

The
Company s policy is to recognize transfers into and out of Level 3 as of the date of the event or change in the circumstances that
caused the transfer. There were no such transfers during the periods being reported.
