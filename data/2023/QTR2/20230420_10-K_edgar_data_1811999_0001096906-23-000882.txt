 PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
 
 Corporate History 
 
 On June 28, 2013, we were incorporated as Somerset Transition Corporation under the Oklahoma General Corporation Act. We were formed to complete a Parent/Subsidiary formation Reorganization under Section 1088(g) of the Oklahoma Act. Upon completion of the Reorganization, we became successor issuer to Transnational Financial Network, Inc., which was originally incorporated in California in 1985 as Transnational Financial Corporation. 
 
 In September 2013, we formed Somerset Property, Inc. SPI as its wholly owned Maryland subsidiary to effect a redomestication into the state of Maryland. We merged with and into SPI pursuant to Articles of Merger filed with the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation on October 3, 2013 and with the Oklahoma Secretary of State on October 11, 2013. 
 
 On July 18, 2017, we formed Revival, Inc. Revival as its wholly owned Nevada subsidiary to effect a redomestication into the state of Nevada. We merged with and into Revival, Inc. 
 4 
 
 pursuant to Articles of Merger filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on July 21, 2017 and with the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation on August 14, 2017. 
 
 On June 27, 2019, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada and changed its name from Revival to Farmhouse, Inc to better reflect our new business endeavors. On August 6, 2019, FINRA approved our name change and our trading symbol was changed from TLVA to FMHS. 
 
 On August 13, 2019, we consummated an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Agreement with Farmhouse, Inc., a Washington corporation Farmhouse Washington as its wholly owned subsidiary. On this date, all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Farmhouse Washington were exchanged for shares of common stock of the Company on a one share for one share basis (the Acquisition ). Upon consummation of the Acquisition, the financial statements of the Company are the continuation of Farmhouse Washington with the adjustment to reflect the capital structure of the Company. 
 
 Prior to the Acquisition, in August 2017, Farmhouse Washington formed Farmhouse DTLA, Inc. DTLA in California as a wholly owned subsidiary. On April 8, 2021, DTLA was awarded a 49 equity interest in a Los Angeles based multi-licensed cannabis retail dispensary, grow, manufacturer and distributor called Los Angeles Farmers, Inc. LAFI ). 
 
 Corporate Overview 
 
 We are a holding company with multiple divisions dedicated to connecting professionals and brands in the legal cannabis industry. We are built on two core competencies trust and connection. Our divisions provide solutions that leverage our trusted brand and facilitate valuable connections across the cannabis industry. We connect the industry through multiple divisions including the @420 brand and @420 Twitter, and the WeedClub Platform. Our @420 brand and @420 Twitter serve as trusted, influential properties that enable the Company to connect, promote and advocate for the industry. We will continue to serve as a leading cannabis connection platform and branch its well-known brand into the budding web3 and metaverse. 
 
 2022 Business Developments 
 
 We began exploring potential acquisitions of cannabis companies to expand our physical footprint in the industry. Acquisitions would improve our ability to leverage our WeedClub Platform and our @420 Twitter handle to connect with consumers. 
 
 We launched a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) division dedicated to connecting the metaverse with cannabis brands. As a leader in technology, we established this division to bring NFTs to cannabis brands to create a symbiotic relationship between two fast-growing industries. Our NFT division explores how cannabis brands can connect with the metaverse through NFTs. It is a natural expansion of our brand and bridges the gap between physical cannabis brands and digital assets. Our NFT division is currently investigating initiatives from creating NFTs with artists, launching an NFT project, and developing NFT IP licensing opportunities with cannabis brands. 
 5 

Farmhouse Divisions 
 
 Each division solves a unique problem within an industry navigating state-by-state regulations and an uncertain federal regulatory landscape. This environment has created a fragmented cannabis market that emphasizes the importance of a trusted facilitator to make value-added connections across the supply chain in our industry. 
 
 @420. Our consumer-facing brand and Twitter handle (with over 100,000 followers) serve as an influential brand that connects us with the greater public. Our Twitter handle enables the NFT division to forge valuable connections in the space and work with established projects. 
 
 WeedClub . Weedclub is one of the first social networks for cannabis professionals with over 5,000 members, generating thousands of valuable connections. WeedClub is an established presence in the cannabis industry that people trust to make valuable connections. As we continue to expand our operations, WeedClub members benefit immensely from the added potential connections. 
 
 Web3 division Vault ): Our newest division that connects cannabis brands with licensing opportunities with influential digital collectible holders and communities to develop new brands that appeal to digitally-native consumers. 
 
 Current and Future Plan of Operations 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a behavioral shift to digital connection and verifiable trust. This shift thrust blockchain technology and digital collectibles to the forefront as virtual groups transformed into supportive, thriving communities centered around digital collectible brands. The top brands generate immense value (intrinsic and financial) while building highly loyal, engaged communities. 
 
 As we transitioned our company online, we started researching and participating in this behavioral shift. Many established brands attempted to enter this space, but few understood the collaborative, accretive culture and failed to gain traction within the community. We positioned our web3 division to leverage our core competencies to drive value for the digital collectible community and our shareholders. 
 
 Our web3 Vault division connects cannabis companies to intellectual property (IP) licensing opportunities from digital collectible holders to launch digitally-native cannabis brands. Since our launch of our Vault division in December 2021, we have developed relationships with six digital collectible holders to seed our IP vault with over 25 blue-chip brands. These brands include Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Bored Ape Kennel Club, CryptoPunks, CrypToadz, Doodles, Meebits, and Gutter Cat Gang. 
 
 Our most notable licensed IP is Mutant Ape Yacht Club #30000, Mega Robot , one of twelve Mega Mutants, the rarest NFTs in the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) universe. Mega Mutants have sold for over 1,000,000 with the Mega Serum previously selling for 5.8 million. 
 6 
 
 In July 2022, we launched our first cannabis activation with Oro Blanco (BAYC #2186) and Urbana to debut a branded cannabis strain across three retail stores in San Francisco. The initial results generated encouraging monthly and quarterly sell-through rates and sales which informed our decision to further build out our Vault division. 
 
 In order to understand web3 culture and the overall market, we developed an advisory board of web3-native experts. Our advisory board helps guide our strategy and decision-making across social media, community, art and branding, and product development. Each advisor has built a personal brand and is well-known across the community. 
 
 In August 2022, we began developing the concept for a Mega Robot cannabis line with Bronx Extracts. This brand builds on our key learnings from the Oro Blanco launch which highlighted the need for standout packaging paired with curated cannabis. This collaboration pairs the premium IP of Mega Robot with premium cannabis sourced and developed by Bronx Extracts to create a brand that appeals to everyday consumers. 
 
 The Mega Robot x Bronx Extracts cannabis line is set to launch in 1H23 in California. The brand will demonstrate the power of our cannabis network combined with our advisory board to launch a brand that appeals to all consumers, including digitally-native ones. 
 
 Revenues 
 
 We generate four types of revenue: subscription fees consisting of membership dues; affiliate advertising from links within the web properties; referral fees from strategic business introductions; and license fees. Each of the above revenue streams are dependent on leads generated within the Farmhouse ecosystem. Details regarding when each revenue stream is recognized are listed below: 
 
 (1) Subscription fees . Subscription fees related to the WeedClub portal are received at the time of purchase. We recognize revenue ratably over the subscription period and deferred revenue is recorded for the portion of the subscription period subsequent to each reporting date. 
 
 (2) Affiliate advertising . Affiliate advertising revenues result from advertising campaigns and are generally multi-month arrangements. We recognize revenue ratably over the campaign period and deferred revenue is recorded for the portion of the campaign period subsequent to each reporting date. 
 
 (3) Referral fees . We generate referral fees when a business transaction is consummated between the Company, as referee, and a potential target company. 
 
 (4) License revenues . We generate revenue from license fees in connection with NFT Art License Agreements, whereby the licensee is granted a limited license from the Company to use one of its licensed NFT s for the purpose of creating, marketing, and selling branded cannabis and hemp products and accessories. We recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement.

 Industry background 
 
 The legalization of medical and recreational marijuana in many states has allowed the growing, processing, distribution, sale and consumption of marijuana products and derivatives. It has led to the need for continuity between the growers, distributors and even the end consumer on matters relating to the growing processes, business startup, state and federal regulations and other legal issues centered around the cannabis industry in general. 
 
 Customers 
 
 A significant portion of our targeted customer base will be comprised of cannabis producers, retailers, consultants and supply chain professionals. We have over 110,000 cannabis industry participants in its network. This includes over 100,000 followers across social media accounts (Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and Facebook), over 10,000 total registrants for live events and over 5,000 members on the WeedClub Platform. 
 
 Customer Service 
 
 Through our WeedClub Platform, visitors and members can contact the WeedClub team via a phone number, email or on various social media sites including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram. 
 
 Product Development Strategy 
 
 Our product development strategy contemplates running parallel development tracks to simultaneously grow the WeedClub Platform and develop potential software and technology that addresses the needs of WeedClub members and the overall cannabis industry. The continued growth of the WeedClub Platform will increase our potential customer base and allow us to replicate the same success seen at the start of WeedClub. By speaking with WeedClub members to discuss their current and future problems and needs, we will be able to develop solutions that address actual market needs with a present pool of potential early adopters. Platform growth at WeedClub will increase our ability to test software and possible blockchain solutions, and to rapidly iterate on product development to effectively discover product market fit. 
 8 

Marketing 
 
 We intend to implement marketing programs typical for end-user technology consumers, such as print, media, social networking, search engine optimization, as well as direct sales calls to specific clients and channel marketing within its existing social network in accordance with applicable law. Our primary marketing program will consist of media, networking, live events, partnerships, search engine optimization, and direct sales calls to existing members. 
 
 Competition 
 
 LinkedIn, AngelList, WomenGrow and MJBizCon are competitors. LinkedIn competes on the same networking, news and advertising platforms as found in WeedClub. While LinkedIn does not specifically target the cannabis niche, it is the largest and most well-known business to business networking company. AngelList provides a similar service as the WeedClub investor portal. Like LinkedIn, AngelList does not cater specifically to the cannabis industry, but cannabis startups and investors currently participate on the platform. WomenGrow and MJBizCon both offer cannabis specific events that compete with the WeedClub @420 pitch. WomenGrow also functions as a live events organization which is similar to WeedClub events. Each of these competitors compete on a specific part of WeedClub, but do not function as a hub like the WeedClub Platform does. We provide all the services as these competitors except WeedClub members have access to each of these services through the WeedClub Platform. Members do not have to use multiple, separate platforms to access these benefits and services. 
 
 Technology 
 
 We operate our online network supporting systems on servers via the Heroku services platform. We also use third-party content distribution networks such as Buffer and Google Analytics for ad serving, optimization, web tracking services and content marketing to improve performance and provide instrumentation. All contracts are click-form based with these service providers. 
 
 Employees and Independent Contractors 
 
 As of April 20, 2023, we have three full-time employees, including our executive officers. We plan to hire additional employees and engage consultants on an as-needed basis. We also have relationships with several independent contractors who provide services to it on a regular basis. 
 
 Government Regulation of Cannabis 
 
 Cannabis (other than hemp and its derivatives) is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 811) CSA and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice DOJ defines Schedule I controlled substances as the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence. If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing 
 9 
 
 with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a 50 million fine, even though these persons are in compliance with state law. 
 
 The United States federal government regulates drugs through the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 811), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Currently, cannabis and cannabidiol CBD (if it has 0.3 percent THC or more) are classified as Schedule I drugs, which are viewed as highly addictive and having no medical value and is illegal to distribute and use. The United States Federal Drug Administration has not approved the sale of cannabis for any medical application but did approve the CBD-based drug epidiolex, in 2018. Doctors may not prescribe cannabis or CBD (0.3 percent THC or more) for medical use under federal law. In 2010, the United States Veterans Affairs Department clarified that veterans using medicinal cannabis or CBD (0.3 percent THC or more) will not be denied services or other medications that are denied to those using illegal drugs. In December 2018, the federal Agriculture Improvement Act (also known as the Farm Bill of 2018) was approved, federally legalizing hemp and its derivatives, such as CBD that contain less than 0.3 THC. 
 
 Currently, forty-seven (47) States and the District of Columbia have laws legalizing cannabis and CBD in some form. In November 2016, California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada all passed measures legalizing the adult use of cannabis. California s Prop. 64 measure allows adults age 21 and older to possess up to one ounce of cannabis and grow up to six plants in their homes. Other tax and licensing provisions of the law did not take effect until January 2018. In November 2020, Arizona, Montana, South Dakota and New Jersey all passed measures legalizing the adult use of cannabis, and Mississippi and South Dakota passed measures legalizing the medical use of cannabis. In March 2021, New York State passed a law to legalize adult use of cannabis.

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 
 We are a party to legal proceedings by our subsidiary, Farmhouse DTLA. 
 
 In August 2017, our subsidiary, DTLA. entered into a Strategic Consulting Agreement (the SCA with Absolute Herbal Pain Solutions, Inc., a medical marijuana growing, and retail company based in Los Angeles that now goes by the name Los Angeles Farmers, Inc. LAFI ). The SCA provided for DTLA to invest substantial sums of money into LAFI and also to provide management services for LAFI going forward. In exchange, LAFI agreed to provide DTLA with a share of any future profits and a 49 equity stake in LAFI. Following the SCA, in excess of 700,000 was spent by DTLA to stabilize LAFI s finances and pay critical bills. In addition, DTLA brought in an outside management company with expertise in running grow and retail operations. Subsequent to DTLA providing funding and management resources to LAFI, DTLA and its management team were locked out of the LAFI facility in late October 2017. 
 
 In October 2017, DTLA commenced litigation in Los Angeles County Superior Court (Case #BC681251) against LAFI and David and Irina Vayntrub, who were the sole officers, directors, and members of LAFI, seeking to enforce its contract rights under the SCA. In March 2018, the litigation was stayed so that the parties could pursue the claims by way of arbitration at Judicate West. In January 2020, following more than a year of discovery, DTLA entered into a confidential settlement with the Vayntrubs, however, the case continued against LAFI. 
 
 In February 2021, a four-day arbitration hearing was held at Judicate West. In April 2021, the Arbitrator overseeing the arbitration hearing issued a judgment in favor of DTLA and against 
 12 
 
 LAFI (the DLTA Judgment ). The DLTA Judgment awarded 49 of LAFI to DTLA as of the change of control in November 2017, along with a share of any profits from November 2017 to the present and going forward, accrued interest on those profits, and costs of bringing the litigation. The DLTA Judgment also appointed a Monitor, to be supervised by the Arbitrator, to determine how much in past profits and interest DTLA is entitled to be awarded and that DTLA is treated fairly by LAFI on a going forward basis. 
 
 Following the issuance of DTLA Judgment, DTLA filed a motion for reimbursement of costs in the amount of 22,382. No objection was filed by LAFI and in June 2021, the amount was confirmed by the Los Angeles County Superior Court as a Judgment. In July 2021, DTLA received reimbursement costs in the amount of 22,382, which was recorded as other income for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Between July and December 2021, the Monitor undertook a detailed process to determine the value of the 49 of profits and proceeds from 2017 to the present that DTLA is entitled to, in addition to the 10 prejudgment interest. The Monitor s report was completed in January 2022. Based on the information in the Monitor s report, DTLA has requested that the Arbitrator issue an award of back profits and interest and order the sale of LAFI to an independent third party in order to allow any judgment to be paid to DTLA. Due to uncertainties, the impact of the DLTA Judgment has not been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 In August 2022, a receiver was appointed by the Los Angeles County Superior Court to assume control of LAFI. As of April 20, 2022, the date of these consolidated financial statements, the receiver is in the process of selling LAFI. It is not known at this time whether the sale of LAFI, if consummated and approved by the Superior Court, will result in any proceeds of the sale being paid to satisfy the DLTA Judgment.

(1) Through April 20, 2023, the date of this Report. 
 
 Our common stock is considered a penny stock under rules promulgated by the SEC. Under these rules, broker-dealers participating in transactions in these securities were subject to first deliver a risk disclosure document which describes risks associated with these stocks, broker-dealers duties, customers rights and remedies, market and other information, and make suitability determinations approving the customers for these stock transactions based on financial situation, investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing, provide monthly account statements to customers, and obtain specific written consent of each customer. With these restrictions, the likely effect of designation as a penny stock is to decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market for the stock, to decrease the liquidity of the stock and increase the transaction cost of sales and purchases of these stocks compared to other securities.

 Corporate Overview 
 
 We are a holding company with multiple divisions dedicated to connecting professionals and brands in the legal cannabis industry. We are built on two core competencies trust and connection. Our divisions provide solutions that leverage our trusted brand and facilitate valuable connections across the cannabis industry. We connect the industry through multiple 
 16 
 
 divisions including the @420 brand and @420 Twitter, and the WeedClub Platform. Our @420 brand and @420 Twitter serve as trusted, influential properties that enable the Company to connect, promote and advocate for the industry. We will continue to serve as a leading cannabis connection platform and branch its well-known brand into the budding web3 and metaverse. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Until such time we can raise additional capital or generate positive cash flow from operations, we will continue to be funded through short-term advances from the Company officers, borrowings under promissory notes and sales of restricted common stock under various offerings. We estimate we will need 2,500,000 in capital, after satisfying our debt obligations, to cover our ongoing expenses and to successfully market and expand our product offerings. This is only an estimate and may change as we receive feedback from customers and have a better feel of the demand and revenues from our new products. Both of these factors may change and we may not be able to raise the necessary capital and if we are able to, that it may not be at favorable rates. We intend to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. 
 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we generated revenues of 10,261 and 12,243, respectively, and we reported net losses of 442,782 and 975,579, respectively. We had negative cash flow from operating activities of 252,793 and 210,232, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of 5,744,699 and total shareholders deficit of 1,583,916. 
 
 Our auditors have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our historical recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations as well as our dependence on private equity and financings. We anticipate that we will continue to report losses and negative cash flow. To date, we have financed our activities principally from the sale of common stock and loans from Company officers. We intend on financing our future working capital needs from these sources until such time that funds provided by our operations are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. We believe that the current cash on hand, loans from Company officers and funds raised from the sale of our common stock allows us sufficient capital for operations and to continue as a going concern. 
 
 In February 2022, the board of directors Board authorized an offering of up to 294,118 shares of restricted common stock at 0.85 per share, providing proceeds of up to 250,000, to be offered and sold only to investors that qualify as accredited investors as that term is defined in Regulation D. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold 69,900 shares of common stock under this offering for proceeds of 59,415. The offering expired on August 1, 2022. 
 
 In June 2022, we sold our domain name blunt.com to an unaffiliated party for 165,000. This was recorded as other income during the year ended December 31, 2022. Also in June 2022, we executed a Litigation Funding Agreement with Legalist Fund III, LP Legalist ), whereby Legalist provided 225,000 of funding to the Company. This was recorded as investment income during the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Related party matters 
 
 The terms of any transaction determined to be with related parties are presented to the board of directors (other than any interested director) for approval and documented in the corporate minutes. Cash advances are commonly provided by our officers for operating expenses and direct payment of Company expenses. Company officers were owed 44,882 and 158,191 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is comprised of cash advances provided to the Company for operating expenses and direct payment of Company expenses by Company officers. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Company officers made cash advances of zero and were repaid 113,309. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Company officers made cash advances of 24,620 and were repaid 14,857. The Company also paid the Company officers the accrued interest of 1,937 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The cash advances are non-interest bearing and are unsecured. 
 
 Company officers own approximately 43.8 of the Company as of December 31, 2022. We have agreed to indemnify Company officers for certain events or occurrences arising as a result of the officer or director serving in such capacity. Other than the foregoing, none of the directors or executive officers of the Company, nor any person who owned of record or was known to own beneficially more than 5 of our outstanding shares of common stock has any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction that has occurred during the past fiscal year. 
 
 Litigation developments 
 
 In July 2021, we successfully enforced our subsidiary s, DTLA, contract rights in a multi-licensed cannabis retail dispensary, grow, manufacturer and distributor called Los Angeles Farmers, Inc. LAFI ). After four years of litigation, a Final Judgment was filed into the record in the Superior Court of California in the County of Los Angeles for case number BC681251 (the DLTA Judgment ). The DTLA Judgment awarded 49 of LAFI to DTLA. In addition to equity ownership, the DTLA Judgment awarded DTLA a share of any profits of this dispensary from November 2017 to the present and going forward along with accrued interest on those profits and the costs of bringing litigation. The DLTA Judgment also appointed a Monitor, to be supervised by the Arbitrator, to determine how much in past profits and interest DTLA is entitled to be awarded and that DTLA is treated fairly by LAFI on a going forward basis. 
 
 Between July and December 2021, the Monitor undertook a detailed process to determine the value of the 49 of profits and proceeds from 2017 to the present that DTLA is entitled to, in addition to the 10 prejudgment interest. The Monitor s report was completed in January 2022. Based on the information in the Monitor s report, DTLA has requested that the Arbitrator issue an award of back profits and interest and order the sale of LAFI to an independent third party in order to allow any judgment to be paid to DTLA. 
 
 In August 2022, a receiver was appointed by the Los Angeles County Superior Court to assume control of LAFI. As of April 20, 2022, the date of these consolidated financial statements, the receiver is in the process of selling LAFI. It is not known at this time whether the sale of LAFI, if consummated and approved by the Superior Court, will result in any proceeds of the sale being paid to satisfy the DLTA Judgment. 
 
 Under GAAP accounting, ownership percentages over 20 would typically be accounted for 
 18 
 
 using the equity method, the Company is accounting for this investment as an investment in equity securities due to the Company not having significant influence over LAFI. The cost of this investment was expensed during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and, due to uncertainties surrounding the value of LAFI and determining any award of back profits and interest, as well as the pending litigation, no value has been reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Farmhouse, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Farmhouse, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Farmhouse, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Going Concern 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the entity will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the entity has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the entity s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Farmhouse, Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Farmhouse, Inc. is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately that may be offset against future taxable income beginning in 2022 through 2041. No tax benefit has been reported in the December 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements since the potential tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance for the same amount. Tax years that remain subject to examination are 2018 and forward. 
 
 Utilization of the NOL carryforwards might be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that may have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), as well as similar state and foreign provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of NOL carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change as defined by Section 382 of the Code results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than fifty percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups. Since the Company s formation, the Company has raised capital through the issuance of common stock on several occasions which, combined with the purchasing stockholders subsequent disposition of those shares, may have resulted in such an ownership change, or

In addition, Legalist was granted a security interest on the assets of the Company. 
 
 Pursuant to the Litigation Funding Agreement, if the proceeds from the LAFI litigation are insufficient to pay in full both the Funder Costs Amount and Funder Recovery Amount, then such proceeds shall be applied exclusively and entirely to Legalist, after which no further amount will be owed to Legalist. If no proceeds are ever received from the LAFI litigation, then Legalist loses their investment. The Company has determined that the money received from Legalist is not a loan and is effectively proceeds from their investment in LAFI which the Company is accounting for as an investment in equity securities with no value due to uncertainties surrounding the value of LAFI. Accordingly, the Company has recorded this as investment income for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15e and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the end of the year covered by this Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of Mr. Horowitz, Chief Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. We concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the year covered by this Report due to material weaknesses identified below. 
 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process, including policies and procedures, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Management assessed the internal control over financial reporting using the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). A system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
 
 Based on the evaluation under the framework in COSO, management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2022 based on such criteria. Deficiencies existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely affect its internal controls and that may be considered material weaknesses. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As a result of the determination that there was a lack of resources to provide segregation of duties consistent with 
 25 
 
 control objectives, the lack of a formal audit committee, and the lack of a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review over financial disclosure and reporting processes, management has determined that material weaknesses existed as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 The weaknesses and the related risks are not uncommon in a company of our size because of the limitations in the size and number of staff. To address these material weaknesses, and subject to the receipt of additional financing or cash flows, we intend to undertake remediation measures to address the material weaknesses described in this Report, including implementing procedures pursuant to which it can ensure segregation of duties and hire additional resources to ensure appropriate review and oversight. 
 
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met under all potential conditions, regardless of how remote, and may not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Auditor s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no formal meetings of our board of directors. The directors authorize material action by written consent executed contemporaneously with the action. 
 28 
 
 We currently do not have a nominating, compensation, audit committee, or committees performing similar functions, nor is there a written nominating, compensation, or audit committee charter. Currently, the entire board of directors is performing the functions of such committees. In lieu of an Audit Committee, our board of directors is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results, and effectiveness of the annual audit of our financial statements and other services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. The board of directors , the Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer review our internal accounting controls, practices, and policies. 
 
 Qualifications of Candidates for Election to the Board 
 
 Our directors take a critical role in guiding our strategic direction and considering the composition of the board of directors. Since 2014, we have had no turnover on the board of directors (one independent member was added in August 2020). As such, we do not have a separate nominating committee. When board of director candidates are considered, they will be evaluated based upon (i) their ability to qualify as independent directors; (ii) their broad-based business and professional skills and experiences; (iii) their experience serving as management or on the board of directors of companies similar to our; (iv) their concern for the long-term interests of the shareholders; and (v) their financial literacy and personal integrity in judgment. To date, we have not taken specific diversity considerations into account when nominating or considering board of director candidates and we have no policy in this regard. In addition, board of director candidates must have time available to devote to Board activities. Accordingly, our board of directors will seek to attract and retain highly qualified directors who have sufficient time to attend to their duties and responsibilities. See Process for Identifying and Evaluating Candidates for Election to the Board below for further discussion of how our board of directors operates in connection with nominations. 
 
 Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 
 
 Mr. Horowitz has served as Chairman, member of our board of directors, Chief Executive Officer and President since January 2014. The board of directors believes it is important to select its Chairman and President in the manner it considers in our best interests and its stockholders at any given point in time. The board of directors believes that the most effective leadership structure for us is for Mr. Horowitz to serve as both as our Chairman and President because a single position reduces the need to hire and compensate additional personnel. Moreover, the board of directors recognizes that, given Mr. Horowitz s familiarity with our day-to-day operations and his long-standing experience with us, it is valuable to have him lead board discussions. Our board of directors as a group fulfill the role of reviewing all proposed transactions that involve potential conflicts of interest and proposing matters for consideration or action by management. Our board of directors and management view this level of independent director involvement as adequate given the nature of our business. In particular, due to the limited size of our operations and headcount and the well-defined nature of our business and operating results, that we have not required more formal and extensive interaction, and the board of directors has not considered it necessary to date. 
 29 
 
 With respect to the board of directors role in the risk oversight of the Company, the board of directors has set forth which transactions may require the prior approval of the board of directors (or an independent portion thereof) and which transactions may proceed with management authorization and without any such board of directors prior approval. 
 
 Process for Identifying and Evaluating Candidates for Election to the Board 
 
 We have no separate nominating committee, however, our management reviews the qualifications and backgrounds of the board of directors, as well as the overall composition of the Board, and recommends to the full board of directors the persons to be nominated for election. In the case of incumbent directors, the board of directors reviews such directors overall service, including the number of meetings attended, level of participation, quality of performance, and whether the director continues to meet the applicable independence standards. In the case of any new director candidates, the questions of independence and financial expertise are important to determine what roles can be performed by the candidate, and the board of directors determines whether the candidate meets the applicable independence standards and the level of the candidate s financial expertise. Any new candidates would be interviewed by the management and, if appropriate, then by all members of the board of directors. The full board of directors will approve the final nominations. The Chairman of the board of directors, acting on behalf of the full board of directors, will extend the formal invitation to become a nominee of our board of directors. 
 
 Significant Employees 
 
 We have no significant employees other than their officers and directors. 
 
 Audit Committee Financial Expert 
 
 Our board of directors does not have a member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. We intend to establish an Audit Committee in the future and identify an individual to serve as an independent director and as the audit committee financial expert.

 Potential Conflicts of Interest

 Director Independence 
 
 We are not currently subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system which has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be independent and, as a result, we are not at this time required to have a board of directors comprised of a majority of Independent Directors. Currently, our board of directors has one independent director, Scott Bostick, within the definition of independence provided by the OTC Markets Group Inc. 
 
 Code of Ethics 
 
 We have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics, but we intend to adopt a formal Code of Ethics in the future.

Based solely on the review of the copies of such forms received by the Company, or written representations from certain reporting persons, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners were complied.
