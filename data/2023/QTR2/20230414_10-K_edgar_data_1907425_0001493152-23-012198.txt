 Data
 Analytic Software Solution 

Business
Overview 

Jocom
Holdings Corp., a Nevada Corporation, is a company that operates through its wholly owned subsidiary, Jocom Holdings Corp., a Company
organized in Labuan, Malaysia. The Nevada and Malaysia corporations share the same exact business plan. 

Note:
The purpose of the Labuan, Malaysia Company is to function as the current regional hub, carrying out the majority of physical operations
of the Company. Initially, we intend for our services to cover the whole of mainland of Malaysia. The Labuan company is part of our international
business structure that encompasses our expansion plans and provides other trade and tax benefits. 

Data
Analytic Software Solution 

Jocom
Holdings Corp currently provides data analytic services in relation to analyzing customers buying patterns as it relates to grocery
items.. It also makes predictions on customers consumption manners, and assists e-commerce
businesses and grocery retailers in optimizing the ir product placements with customers .
The services are provided through using in house developed data analytic software solution namely JOCOM AI Smart Platform ,
which was developed by our CEO, Mr. Sew based on his past experience in the software development and fresh grocery industry. JOCOM AI
Smart Platform is a subscription-based web software. Our sole client at this time, who is also a related party of the Issuer, is an e-commerce
platform operator located in Malaysia. In the future we plan to expand our services to additional customers and to customers in other
geographic regions in Southeast Asia. 

Logistic
Predictive Algorithm 

We
plan to expand our software solution to cover the logistic segment by developing a logistic prediction algorithm. This software solution
will take into account several factors such as fleet availability, incoming orders, traffic conditions etc., to create a real-time simulation
and provide the best possible routes and delivery options, thus increasing delivery efficiency and saving costs. 

We
believe the biggest challenges for local store-based grocery retailers and online grocery stores is timeliness of orders and reliability
of delivery to customers which is essential in building a loyal customer base and retaining existing customers. Given this, we believe
that a software solution with logistic prediction algorithm is essential for grocery retailers and online grocery stores for the logistical
management of their grocery products. Our software solution will have a user interface with logistic service provider and logistic operator
so grocery retailers could integrate their system with their logistic provider partners system. 

2 

Our
logistic engine will take in location data and any real-time road conditions to allow for a smoother and faster delivery system. Our
delivery partner will feed location and road data, such as bumpy roads, traffic lights, speed cameras, potholes or even accident-prone
areas, automatically into our engine to ensure end users get their parcel and delivery on time. 

On
cross border trade, our logistic engine will be able to align with multiple 3 rd party logistics provider and integrate with
them to the extent of cross border, by regional, outstation, suburb, cities, and choose the fastest route to send products to international
end user in the best effort modelling. The selection of various and multiple logistic will be made possible by integrating to DHL, FedEx,
post offices, PO boxes and even a scheduled 3rd party logistic upon arrival on the different countries. The shipping by air and sea freight
will allow the tracking of the parcel on real-time basis. 

At
present, all plans pertaining to the future development of our data analytic software solution are in development, and we cannot state
with any certainty how much time, capital, or other resources will be required to fully develop our data analytic software solution. 

JOCOM
Mobile Commerce Platform 

Traditionally,
we believe manufacturers were at the mercy of selling via wholesalers and retail chains, as it was extremely difficult to reach the end
consumer directly if they operated independently. Nonetheless, with the emergence of e-commerce platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce,
and marketplaces like Amazon and Etsy, entrepreneurs have opened their own stores and thus began D2C manufacturing or Factory-to-Consumer
(F2C). [18] 

The
mission of our company is to address and develop solutions that impact the lives of both consumers and businesses through m-commerce
technology. We intend to provide a total integrated solution that protects both consumers and vendors. Jocom Holdings Corp will
be able to provide a convenient way to assist traditional businesses by providing the platform of latest technology connecting to rural
farmers, producers and vendors with affluent consumer via e-commerce. This will greatly increase the margins of producers and subsequently
removing intermediaries and inefficiencies along the supply chain line, enabling transfer of value directly from point-to-point. We believe
that customers will be able to shop for items at their own leisure and in the comfort of their own home by browsing through the different
categories or using the search function bar and making payments through credit cards and or other major internet payment gateway solutions. 

We
intend to eventually develop into a full-fledged m-commerce (Mobile commerce) platform specialized in online groceries and shopping.
Though data collected from our analytic software solution and publicly available information, we anticipate that our system will automate
the customer acquisition modelling, a process which automatically identifies the best potential leads and establishes the best strategies
to convert user traffic into active customers. 

For
the farmers/producers/vendors side, our system will generate a list of information, including but not limited to, gender, age, monthly
consumption, demographic area etc., and product types that we believe would most appeal to them based on this information. This information
will also be automatically categorized into various product types, such as dry, powder, liquid, chilled, frozen and other keywords. The
data AI engine will then give suggestion on monthly output for products of same category on a household basis, thus it could be used
for production forecasting and sales forecasting purposes. We believe this will support brands and manufacturers to not under or overproduce. 

A
further 12 months sales cycle of similar products that exist in our database can then be compared, on one-to-one or group basis. We believe
our AI engine can eventually produce more precise prediction and replace the forecasting of retailers and hypermarket, thus speeding
up the sales process of particular SKU in the shortest time frame. 

We
intend that our grocery e-modules will able to integrate with other e-commerce platforms to sell our specialty, namely Asian Groceries,
to other SEA and International countries via a cross border logistic integration. 

Patents 

Via
our wholly owned subsidiary, Jocom Holdings Corp., we own the rights to a propriety analytics platform, JOCOM AI SMART PLATFORM ,
referred to herein as, the Software , which analyzes buying patterns and customer behaviors of consumers of grocery items
within Malaysia. We also have an interface that allows users to purchase and have delivered grocery items delivered. Our Software is
able to integrate on our interface and analyze data from the interface. Amongst other things, the Software can analyze customer behaviors,
predict customers behaviors, and optimize product placement.

The
Patent and Trademark number is LY2021W02673. The patent covers the geographic area of Malaysia. 

The
details of the Patent can be found at the following source: https://iponlineext.myipo.gov.my/SPHI/Extra/IP/Mutual/Browse.aspx?sid=637880787831647295 

Marketing 

Our
current marketing plans are still at an initial stage. Going forward we intend to introduce Facebook campaigns and various online advertisement
to promote our services. We plan to introduce vouchers, a loyalty program, bulk purchases, discount campaigns and other strategies that
would increase awareness of our brand. We will also expand our offerings to include other categories such as healthy snacks and organic
food. 

The
Company will position itself to market with a mobile e-commerce application that includes the ability to check stock in local stores,
or sending push notifications when users get within a certain range of a local warehouse to be able to target them with personalized
offers. 

The
Company plan to focus its intention on cultivating a positive customer experience by managing both orders and returns. Features such
as delivery and returns tracking will be integrated to give users more control and engagement with the buying process. We believe that
creating membership and loyalty rewards options will also keep customer coming back. 

The
Company intends to integrate and build machine learning into the sales platform, allowing it to track behavior and predict user needs,
simultaneously boosting Jocom Holdings Corp s
 sales and improve customer experience. 

Positioning
 Jocom Holdings Corp as an environment and or health-conscious brand would be a strong differentiator in the market, since the
competition has not adopted this strategy. 

Competition 

Jocom
Holdings Corp s will be in direct negotiation and contact with vendors, manufacturers, wholesalers and main distributors in
the grocery supply chain, which we believe will allow the company to enjoy up to 20 gross margin, while keeping only minimal product
stock. The Company intends to attract vendors, as many of them are not IT-savvy or familiar with e-commerce operations but wish to participate
in the growing internet business. Dealing directly with Jocom Holdings Corp also allows better margin for vendors as the company
handles the logistics and distribution i.e. order picking, sorting and delivery (with cold storage support) which save vendors 
cost and ensure efficient and fresh delivery to the customers. At present our competition is comprised of any and all company s
offering online grocery shopping within Malaysia and ASEAN, although we believe that our intended 24 hour deliver, our anticipated gross
margins, the utility of our mobile application, and our officers business connections, all provide us with a significant competitive
advantage. 

Employees 

As
of December 31, 2022, the company has a total of 2 full-time employees at our headquarter office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia which includes
our founder and Chief Executive Officer Mr. Sew, and our co-founder Chief Financing Officer, Ms. Chua. Currently, all of our employees,
Officers and/or Directors have the flexibility to work on our business up to 30 hours per week, but are prepared to devote more time
if necessary. 

As
our business and operations increase, we plan to hire full time management, technical and administrative support personnel. Our CEO,
Mr. Sew, who graduated with a Computer Science degree and has more than 20 years of extensive experience in IT and software development,
will be the key officer developing our technology infrastructure. 

We
do not presently have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt
plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to our Officers, Directors or employees. 

Government
Regulation 

At
present, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which may include business licensing requirements,
income taxes and payroll taxes. In general, the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and supervisory
requirements.

5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

Presently,
there is no public market for the common shares. There has been no trading in the Company s securities, and there has been no bid
or ask prices quoted. We cannot assure you that there will be a market for our common stock in the future. 

Holders 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had 57,600,000 shares of our Common Stock par value, .0001 issued and outstanding. There were 53 beneficial
owners of our Common Stock. 

Transfer
Agent and Registrar 

The
transfer agent for our capital stock is VStock Transfer, LLC, with an address at 18, Lafayette Place, Woodmere, New York 11598 and telephone
number is +1 (212)828-8436. 

Penny
Stock Regulations 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security
that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition
of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of 1,000,000, or annual
incomes exceeding 200,000 individually, or 300,000, together with their spouse). 

For
transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities
and have received the purchaser s prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt
transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole
market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly
statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stocks. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock
and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must
have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s
financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that
there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements
make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the investors 
ability to buy and sell our stock. 

Dividend
Policy 

Any
future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends on shares of our Common Stock will be made at the discretion of our
board of directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. We are under no obligations or restrictions to declare or pay dividends
on our shares of Common Stock. In addition, we currently have no plans to pay such dividends. Our board of directors currently intends
to retain all earnings for use in the business for the foreseeable future.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Basis

with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP and include the accounts of Jocom
Holdings Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Jocom Holdings Corp. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated on
consolidation. The Company has adopted December 31 as its fiscal year end. 

Basis
of consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions
have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

Use
of estimates 

Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheets, and the reported
revenue and expenses during the year reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Cash
and cash equivalents 

Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. 

Plant
and equipment 

Plant
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated
on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational. 

Categories 
 
 Estimated
 useful life 
 
 Renovation 
 
 2
 years 

Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The gain or loss on the disposal of plant and equipment is the difference between
the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized in the statement of operations 

Leases 

Effective
November 1, 2019, the Company adopted the guidance of ASC 842, Leases, which requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset
and a lease liability for virtually all leases. The implementation of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated
financial statements and did not have a significant impact on our liquidity. The Company adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective
approach. (see Note 6). 

Revenue
recognition 

In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic
606, Revenue from Contracts . ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the
terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations
in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance
obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to
contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers
to its clients. 

Revenue
is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue. The
Company derives its revenue from provision of technical consultancy on solar power system and consultancy on green energy solution. 

Cost
of revenue 

Cost
of revenue includes the cost of services in providing business mentoring, nurturing, incubating and corporate development advisory services 

Income
taxes 

Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ASC Topic 740 ).
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the year that includes the enactment date. 

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the
financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax
positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal
course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred
a net loss of 428,327, suffered an accumulated deficit of 556,156, capital deficiency of 60,756 and negative operating cash flows of
 294,054. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the
date that the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the
Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support from its shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders
or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the Company s obligations as they become due. No assurance can be
given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the
Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in
the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stock holders, in the case of equity financing. 

10 

Net
loss per share 

The
Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic loss per share
is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income per
share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common
shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares
were dilutive. 

Foreign
currencies translation 

Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated
into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded
in the statements of operations. 

The
reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars US ). The Company s subsidiary in Labuan maintains its
books and record in United States Dollars US respectively, and Ringgits Malaysia MYR is functional currency
as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates. 

In
general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiary whose functional currency is not the US are translated
into US , in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation of Financial Statement , using the exchange rate on the
balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the year. The gains and losses resulting
from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive
income within the statement of stockholders equity. 

Translation
of amounts from MYR into US 1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective year: 

As
 of and for the year ended December 31,

Related
parties 

Parties,
which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control
the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also
considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. 

Fair
value of financial instruments: 

The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and
amount due to a director approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. 

The
Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820-10 ),
with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level
 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 

Level
 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level
 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

Recent
accounting pronouncements 

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of
any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Disclosures
Control and Procedures 

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2022. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material
weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. 

A
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control
over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses
which have caused management to conclude that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i)
inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting
and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. 

Changes
in internal controls over financial reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Corporate
Governance 

The
Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and in
other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations.
The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company s employees, officers
and Directors as the Company is not required to do so. 

In
lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company s Board of Directors, is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning
the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company s financial
statements and other services provided by the Company s independent public accountants. The Board of Directors, the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company review the Company s internal accounting controls, practices and policies. 

Committees
of the Board 

Our
Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our
Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our Directors believes that it is not necessary to have such
committees, at this time, because the Director(s) can adequately perform the functions of such committees. 

Audit
Committee Financial Expert 

Our
Board of Directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert 
as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term
is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14)
of the FINRA Rules. 

We
believe that our Director(s) are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and
procedures for financial reporting. The Director(s) of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because
management believes that the Board of Directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that
retaining an independent Director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome
and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash
flows from operations to date. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

Our
Directors and our Executive officers have not been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years: 

1. 
 bankruptcy
 petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the
 bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 
 
 2. 
 any
 conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor
 offenses); 
 
 3. 
 being
 subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction,
 permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his/her involvement in any type of business, securities
 or banking activities; or 
 
 4. 
 being
 found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have
 violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. 

14 

5. 
 Such
 person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State
 securities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended,
 or vacated; 
 
 6. 
 Such
 person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated
 any Federal commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not
 been subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated; 
 
 7. 
 Such
 person was the subject of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not
 subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of:(i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities
 law or regulation; or(ii) Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited
 to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist
 order, or removal or prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with
 any business entity; or 
 
 8. 
 Such
 person was the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory
 organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section
 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that
 has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 

Independence
of Directors 

We
are not required to have independent members of our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until such
time as we are required to do so. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and
determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal,
business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand
in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Shareholder
Proposals 

Our
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors.
The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment. 

A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our Chief Executive
Officer and Director, Sew Wen Chean, at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

Beneficial
ownership has been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to
be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares).
In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon
exercise of an option or warrant) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership
of any person, the amount of shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person by reason of such acquisition
rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following table does not necessarily reflect
the person s actual voting power at any particular date. 

(1) 
 Beneficial
 ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and generally includes voting or investment
 power with respect to securities. Beneficial ownership also includes shares of stock subject to options and warrants currently exercisable
 or exercisable within 60 days of the date of this table. In determining the percent of common stock owned by a person or entity as
 of the date of this Report, (a) the numerator is the number of shares of the class beneficially owned by such person or entity, including
 shares which may be acquired within 60 days on exercise of warrants or options and conversion of convertible securities, and (b)
 the denominator is the sum of (i) the total shares of common stock outstanding on as of the date of this Annual Report (57,600,000
 shares), and (ii) the total number of shares that the beneficial owner may acquire upon exercise of the derivative securities. Unless
 otherwise stated, each beneficial owner has sole power to vote and dispose of its shares.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of Jocom Holdings Corp. 

 Unit
No. 11-1, Level 11, Tower 3, Avenue 3, 

 Bangsar
South, No. 8, Jalan Kerinchi, 

 59200
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Jocom Holdings Corp. (the Company as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity, and consolidated
statements of cash flows for the each of two years in the year and period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
each of two years in the year and period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 the Company incurred a net loss of 428,327 and having
capital deficiency of 60,756. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to those charged with governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements
and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not
alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters
below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Recoverability
and impairment of trade receivables 

The
Company recognizes trade receivables USD 48,000 and USD NIL as at December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively, as disclosed in Note 8 to
the consolidated financial statements. Subsequent to recognition of allowance for doubtful debt, the trade receivables as represents
approximately 38 and 0 of the Company s total assets for respective financial year and period. 

We
focus and assess the recoverability of the trade receivables involved judgements and estimation uncertainty in analyzing historical trend
in bad payment, indicators of expected credit losses (ECL), customer concentration, customer creditworthiness and customer payment terms
and adjusted for forward looking macro-economic factors. Auditing trade receivables is an essential component of the financial audit
process. 

Our
audit procedures in this area among others to test the existence, completeness, accuracy, and valuation of trade receivables included
the following: 

(a) 
 Obtaining
 debtor confirmation requests to the Company s customers to confirm the balances of their outstanding receivables; 

(b) 
 Reviewing
 ageing analysis of receivables and testing the reliability thereof; 

(c) 
 Reviewing
 subsequent collections for major receivables and overdue amount; 

(d) 
 Making
 inquiries of management regarding the action plans to recover overdue amount;

, suffered an accumulated deficit of ,
capital deficiency of and negative operating cash flows of . These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support
from its shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the
Company s obligations as they become due. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or,
if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing,
if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its
stock holders, in the case of equity financing.

Major suppliers 

For

purchase and the accounts payable balances at period-end. 

(c)
Credit risk 

Financial
instruments that are potentially subject to credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company believes the concentration
of credit risk in its trade receivables is substantially mitigated by its ongoing credit evaluation process and relatively short collection
terms. The Company does not generally require collateral from customers. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for doubtful
accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information. 

(d)
Exchange rate risk 

The
Company cannot guarantee that the current exchange rate will remain stable, therefore there is a possibility that the Company could post
the same amount of income for two comparable periods and because of the fluctuating exchange rate actually post higher or lower income
depending on exchange rate of RM converted to US on that date. The exchange rate could fluctuate depending on changes in political and
economic environments without notice.
