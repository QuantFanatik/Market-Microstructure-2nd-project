DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS THE COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS GrowLife, Inc. GrowLife or the Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and is headquartered in Kirkland, Washington. We were founded in 2012 with the Closing of the Agreement and Plan of Merger with SGT Merger Corporation. Also previously reported, we did not fund the purchase of the remaining 49 of stock of EZ-CLONE that was due on July 15, 2020 and the founders of EZ-CLONE entered into litigation against the Company. Effective December 29, 2022 the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual General Release SAMGA whereby the Company and the founder of EZ-CLONE resolved all disputes between the parties. As a result of the SAMGA the Company s ownership percentage has been reduced to 19.6 thereby eliminating the consolidation of EZ-CLONE at such date and the results of EZ-CLONE operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021are included in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. The GrowLife executive team has focused on exploring new business alternatives for the Company and settlement on the EZ-CLONE litigation matter. As a result, the Company has decided to divest away from the hydroponics business and focused on functional mushroom business opportunities. We see a growing market, intend to service our existing distribution channel and will build on opportunities in the medicinal mushroom industry. On January 7, 2023 the Company acquired the assets of Bridgetown Mushrooms and assumed certain debt that was secured by such assets. We believe this is an opportunity for our customers, shareholders and one where GrowLife is uniquely positioned to capitalize on. The Company s goal is to become the nation s largest mushroom supplier focused on serving more providers of mushroom-based products of high quality, exceptional value and competitive price. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Employees As of December 31, 2022, we had two full-time employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. 4 Table of Contents Acquisition and Reduction of ownership of EZ-CLONE On October 15, 2018, we closed the Purchase and Sale Agreement with EZ-CLONE Enterprises, Inc., a California corporation (the Agreement ). On November 5, 2019, we amended the Agreement with one 24.5 shareholder of EZ-CLONE Enterprises, Inc. EZ-CLONE ), to extend the date to purchase the remaining 49 of stock of EZ-CLONE in exchange for a 20 extension fee (a total of 171,000 for the 49 or 85,500 for each 24.5 shareholder) of the 855,000 cash payable at the earlier of the closing of 2,000,000 in funding or nine months (July 2020). The Company did not fund the purchase of the remaining 49 of stock of EZ-CLONE by the extended deadline. On September 15, 2020, we received notice that William Blackburn and Brad Mickelsen Plaintiffs ), minority shareholders of EZ-CLONE Enterprises, Inc., a majority owned subsidiary of the Company, filed a complaint against the Company and its officers the Superior Court of California, County of Sacramento Complaint for claims related to breach under the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated October 15, 2018 between the Company and Plaintiffs. The Complaint also alleges that the Company and its Officers made certain false representations and other claims to consummate the Transaction and as a result has failed to complete the second closing as required under Purchase and Sale Agreement. The Plaintiffs are seeking rescission of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, unspecified damages in excess of ten thousand dollars, and other equitable relief. On September 15, 2020, we filed a notice of removal with the California Superior Court, County of Sacramento and the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California. The case was removed to Federal District Court for the Eastern District of California and Plaintiffs filed an Ex Parte Application for TRO and an Order for Preliminary Injunction with the Federal Court. The TRO was granted on September 16, 2020 and a preliminary injunction hearing was scheduled for September 29, 2020. After reviewing all pleadings and oral arguments at the hearing, the Court issued a ruling granting Plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction. The parties provided legal briefs to the Federal court to determine if rescission should be granted. The Court did not reach a decision on this issue, and denied without prejudice, the Company s effort to reverse the preliminary injunction. As of December 31, 2021, we recorded a liability of 2,131,000 related to the acquisition of which a 1,105,000 is payable in stock and 1,026,000 is payable in cash. On December 29, 2022, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual General Release Settlement Agreement with EZ-CLONE Enterprises whereby our ownership percentage was reduced to 19.6 . The Settlement Agreement provides that the Company and Mr. Blackburn dismiss the claims against one another and that EZ-CLONE retains all obligations under the warehouse lease. As a result, we have not consolidated the balance sheet of EZ-CLONE at December 31, 2022, however the results of operations for the period through the date of the Settlement Agreement and for the year ended December 31, 2021 are reported as Discontinued Operations. OUR COMMON STOCK As of March 17, 2020, we commenced trading on the OTCQB Market ("OTCQB"). PRIMARY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES We are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings, our need for additional financing, the sale of significant numbers of our shares, the potential adjustment in the exercise price of our convertible debentures, including warrants, and a volatile market price for our common stock.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Operating Leases The Company is obligated under the following leases for its various facilities. On May 31, 2022, the Company rented space in Kirkland, Washington on a month-to-month basis for the Company s corporate office and use of space in the Regus network. On December 14, 2018, GrowLife, Inc. entered into a lease agreement with Pensco Trust Company for a 28,000 square feet industrial space at 10170 Croydon Way, Sacramento, California 95827 used for the assembly and sales of plastic parts by EZ-CLONE. The monthly lease payment is 17,500 and increases approximately 3 per year. The lease expires on December 31, 2023. As part of the Settlement Agreement, GrowLife, Inc. is no longer obligated under the lease agreement. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we may become subject to various legal proceedings that are incidental to the ordinary conduct of its business. Although we cannot accurately predict the amount of any liability that may ultimately arise with respect to any of these matters, it makes provision for potential liabilities when it deems them probable and reasonably estimable. These provisions are based on current information and may be adjusted from time to time according to developments. 6 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES General The following description of our capital stock and provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws are summaries and are qualified by reference to our articles of incorporation and the bylaws. We have filed copies of these documents with the SEC as exhibits to our Form 10-K. Authorized Capital Stock On November 8, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to increase the authorized shares of common stock Common Stock from 120,000,000 to 740,000,000 shares. As a result of the increase, we have an aggregate 750,000,000 authorized shares consisting of: (i) 740,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.0001 per share. Capital Stock Issued and Outstanding As of December 31, 2022, we have issued and outstanding securities on a fully diluted basis, consisting of: 1,800 shares of Series A preferred stock, which is convertible into 1,800,000 shares of common stock; 7,083,254shares of common stock; Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 7,917,222 shares of common stock with expiration dates between May and November 2027 at exercise prices ranging from 0.05 to 4.50 per share; and An unknown number of common shares to be issued under the Convertible Notes Payable financing agreements. Voting Common Stock Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and do not have cumulative voting rights. An election of directors by our stockholders shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote on the election. On all other matters, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote is required for approval, unless otherwise provided in our articles of incorporation, bylaws or applicable law. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive proportionately any dividends as may be declared by our board of directors, subject to any preferential dividend rights of outstanding preferred stock. In the event of our liquidation or dissolution, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive proportionately all assets available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all debts and other liabilities and subject to the prior rights of any outstanding preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of common stock are subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that we may designate and issue in the future. 7 Table of Contents Preferred Stock Under the terms of our articles of incorporation, our board of directors is authorized to issue shares of non-voting preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval. Our board of directors has the discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, of each series of non-voting preferred stock. The purpose of authorizing our board of directors to issue non-voting preferred stock and determine our rights and preferences is to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on specific issuances. The issuance of non-voting preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, future financings and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or could discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Other than the Series B and C Preferred Stock discussed below, there are no shares of non-voting preferred stock presently outstanding and we have no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock. Series A Convertible Preferred Stock On November 17, 2022, the Company designated 1,800 shares of its authorized and unissued preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock and filed a Certificate of Designation of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of GrowLife, Inc. (the Series A Certificate of Designation with the Delaware Secretary of State. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into 1,000 shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment as provided in the Series A Certificate of Designation) at any time at the option of the holder, provided that the holder is prohibited from converting the Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock if, as a result of such conversion, the holder, together with its affiliates, would own more than 4.99 of the total number of shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding, (the Beneficial Ownership Limitation ), provided that the holder may reset the Beneficial Ownership Limitation to a higher or lower number (not to exceed 9.99 of the total number of Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately after giving effect to a conversion) upon providing written notice to the Company. Any such notice providing for an increase to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will be effective 61 days after delivery to the Company. In the event of the Company s liquidation, dissolution, or winding up holders of Series A Preferred, any such distribution shall be distributed among the holders of Common Stock, Series A Preferred and any other class or series of preferred stock of the Corporation entitled to participate with the Common Stock in a liquidating distribution, pro rata in proportion to the shares of Common Stock then held by them and the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which they would have the right to acquire upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred, assuming the full conversion of all Common Stock Equivalents then held by them. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights, except as required by law. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are not entitled to receive any dividends payable to holders of Common Stock. The foregoing description of the Series A Preferred Stock does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the Series A Certificate of Designation, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 3.1 to our Current Report filed November 8, 2022, and is incorporated herein by reference. Warrants to Purchase Common Stock As of December 31, 2022, we had warrants to purchase an aggregate of 7,917,222 shares of common stock with expiration dates between April and November 2027 at exercise price ranging from 0.05 to 4.50 per share. In addition, we have an unknown number of common shares to be issued under the Convertible Notes Payable financing agreements, due to the variable conversion features. Options to Purchase Common Stock On November 5, 2021, at our annual shareholder meeting the Second Amended and Restated 2017 Stock Incentive Plan was adopted to increase the shares issuable under the plan from 1,333,333 to 75,000,000 shares. All terms of the Plan shall remain the same with the exception of the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan. We have 75,000,000 shares available for issuance under the Second Amended and Restated 2017 Stock Incentive Plan. There are no outstanding unexercised stock option grants as of December 31, 2022. The Company filed registration statements on Form S-8 to register 1,333,333 shares of our common stock related to the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan and First Amended and Restated 2017 Stock Incentive Plan. Dividend Policy We have not previously paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate or contemplate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to use all our available funds to develop our business. We can give no assurances that we will ever have excess funds available to pay dividends. Change in Control Provisions Our articles of incorporation and by-laws provide for a maximum of nine directors, and the size of the Board cannot be increased by more than three directors in any calendar year. There is no provision for classification or staggered terms for the members of the Board of Directors. Our articles of incorporation also provide that except to the extent the provisions of Delaware General Corporation Law require a greater voting requirement, any action, including the amendment of the Company s articles or bylaws, the approval of a plan of merger or share exchange, the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company s property other than in the usual and regular course of business, shall be authorized if approved by a simple majority of stockholders, and if a separate voting group is required or entitled to vote thereon, by a simple majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by that voting group. Our bylaws provide that only the Chief Executive Officer or a majority of the Board of Directors may call a special meeting. The bylaws do not permit the stockholders of the Company to call a special meeting of the stockholders for any purpose. Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws Provisions Our articles of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging potential acquisition proposals or tender offers or delaying or preventing a change in control, including changes a stockholder might consider favorable. In particular, our articles of incorporation and bylaws among other things: permit our board of directors to alter our bylaws without stockholder approval; and provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled by a majority of directors in office, although less than a quorum. Such provisions may have the effect of discouraging a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors and in the policies formulated by them, and to discourage some types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change in control of our company. These provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and to discourage some tactics that may be used in proxy fights. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure our company outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging such proposals because, among other things, negotiation of such proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. 8 Table of Contents However, these provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts. These provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management. Market Price of and Dividends on Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters As of March 4, 2019, we began to trade on the OTC Pink Sheet stocks system because our bid price had closed below 0.01 for more than 30 consecutive calendar days. As of March 17, 2020, we commenced trading on the OTCQB Market ("OTCQB") after successfully up-listing from the OTC Pink Market.

The other expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, included (i) change in fair value of the derivative liability of 1,348,000; (ii) interest expense of 1,964,000; (iii) gain on conversions of 205,000; and (iv) gain on debt forgiveness of 183,000. The change in derivative liability is the non-cash change in the fair value and relates to our derivative instruments. The decrease in non-cash interest related to accrued interest expense, write-off of original issue discount and the derivative liability calculated on our notes payable. On April 5, 2021, we entered into a Warrant Settlement Agreement dated March 31, 2021, with St. George and Iliad to resolve a dispute related to the calculation of shares issuable under warrants issued in prior financings whereby we agreed that upon the exercise of the warrant of up 14,250,000 shares of our common stock that the balance of the warrant related to a 2018 financing agreement would be cancelled. We recorded a loss on debt settlement of 2,422,000 as of December 31, 2021. The 14,250,000 warrants were exercised during 2021. In 2021, the Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of 1,025,000 due to the change in the fair value of the shares. The other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 included (i) change in derivative liability of 973,000; (ii) interest expense of 3,243,000; and (iii) loss on debt conversions of 931,000; offset by (iv) gain on settlement of debt of 1,025,000. The change in derivative liability is the non-cash change in the fair value and relates to our derivative instruments. The non-cash interest related to accrued interest expense on our notes payable. The loss on debt conversions related to the conversion of our notes payable at prices below the market price. Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations On December 29, 2022, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual General Release Settlement Agreement with EZ-CLONE Enterprises whereby our ownership percentage was reduced to 19.6 . As a result, EZ-CLONE results for the year ended December 31, 2022 are reflected as loss on discontinued operations of 1,931,00 as compared to a profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 of 32,000. Eliminating the various assets and liabilities relating to EZ-CLONE at December 31, 2022 resulted in a gain of 1,713,000. Net Loss Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 4,483,000 as compared to 5,473,000 for the for the year ended December 31, 2021 for the reasons discussed above. We expect losses to continue as we implement our business plan. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standard Codification ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern, requires that management evaluate whether there are relevant conditions and events that, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. However, since inception, we have sustained significant operating losses and such losses are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of 164 million, cash and cash equivalents of 94,000 and a working capital deficit of 3,400,000 excluding convertible debt and the derivative liability. Additionally, we used cash in operating activities of 1,537,000 and 3,656,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, excluding discontinued operations. We will require additional cash funding to fund operations beyond June 15, 2023. Accordingly, management has concluded that we do not have sufficient funds to support operations within one year after the date the financial statements are issued and, therefore, we concluded there was substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 12 Table of Contents To fund further operations, we will need to raise additional capital. We may obtain additional financing in the future through the issuance of its common stock, or through other equity or debt financings. Our ability to continue as a going concern or meet the minimum liquidity requirements in the future is dependent on its ability to raise significant additional capital, of which there can be no assurance. If the necessary financing is not obtained or achieved, we will likely be required to reduce its planned expenditures, which could have an adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and our ability to achieve its strategic objective. Historically, the Company has been successful in its ability to raise the financing necessary to continue operations without interruption. There can be no assurance that financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. The financial statements contain no adjustments for the outcome of these uncertainties. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and have a material adverse effect on our future financial results, financial position and cash flows. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 1,537,000. This amount was primarily related to a net loss of 4,265,000 from continuing operations, reduced by non-cash expenses of 2,560,000 including; (i) non-cash interest expense of 1,882,000; (ii) change in derivative liability of 1,348,000; (iii) net working capital increase of 77,000 and offset by; (iv) gain on debt conversions of 205,000; and (v) gain on debt forgiveness of 183,000. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, excluding discontinued operations, represent advances on the purchase of Bridgetown assets of 160,000. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 1,594,000. The amount related to proceeds from note payable of 1,727,000, offset by repayment of debt of 123,000 and purchase of shares from the reverse stock split. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The application of GAAP involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see summary of significant accounting policies more fully described in Note 3 to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures , defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; Level 2 Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and. Level 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. The recorded value of other financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are based upon the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities. 13 Table of Contents Derivative financial instruments - We evaluate all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a Binomial pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date. Stock Based Compensation We have share-based compensation plans under which employees, consultants, suppliers and directors may be granted restricted stock, as well as options to purchase shares of our common stock at the fair market value at the time of grant. Stock-based compensation cost is measured by us at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, over the requisite service period using an estimated forfeiture rate. For options issued to employees, we recognize stock compensation costs utilizing the fair value methodology over the related period of benefit. Grants of stock options and stock to non-employees and other parties are accounted for in accordance with the ASC 718. Convertible Securities Based upon ASC 815-15, we have adopted a sequencing approach regarding the application of ASC 815-40 to convertible securities issued subsequent to December 31, 2015. We will evaluate our contracts based upon the earliest issuance date. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Nevertheless, we have no investments in any market risk sensitive instruments either held for trading purposes or entered into for other than trading purposes. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Reference is made to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this report. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE There were no disagreements with our accountants on accounting and financial disclosures. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers concluded as of December 31, 2022, that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting discussed immediately below. 14 Table of Contents Identified Material Weaknesses A material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management identified the following material weakness during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting: Audit Committee : The current Audit Committee consists of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. On December 31, 2022 the only independent director resigned from the board and audit committee. Thus, only one non-independent director currently sits on the committee. We expect to expand this committee during 2023 once a qualified candidate is identified. Personnel: We do not employ a full time Chief Financial Officer. David Dohrmann serves as both Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. We utilize a consultant to assist with our financial reporting. There are limited personnel to assist with the accounting and financial reporting function, which results in: (i) a lack of segregation of duties and (ii) controls that may not be adequately designed or operating effectively and have not been formally documented. Despite the existence of material weaknesses, the Company believes the financial information presented herein is materially correct and fairly presents the financial position and operating results of the year ended December 31, 2022, in accordance with GAAP. During 2023, the Company intends to seek qualified accounting staff to expand its internal accounting and reporting functions. Contractual Terms and Obligations The Company entered into various financing agreements involving stock purchase agreements, notes and warrants. The terms of these legal instruments contain complex legal terms, conditions and calculations. Managements understanding of certain terms and conditions of the warrant agreements was not adequate to insure proper accounting and disclosure of the warrant terms. (b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework . Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their cost. ITEM 9B.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Compensation Discussion and Analysis Overview of Compensation Program This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the material elements of compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to each of our executive officers named in the Compensation Table on page 22 under Remuneration of Executive Officers (the Named Executive Officers who served during the year ended December 31, 2022. This compensation discussion primarily focuses on the information contained in the following tables and related footnotes and narrative for the last completed fiscal year. We also describe compensation actions taken after the last completed fiscal year to the extent that it enhances the understanding of our executive compensation disclosure. The principles and guidelines discussed herein would also apply to any additional executive officers that the Company may hire in the future. 18 Table of Contents The Compensation Committee of the Board has responsibility for overseeing, reviewing and approving executive compensation and benefit programs in accordance with the Compensation Committee s charter. The members of the Compensation Committee are David Dohrmann. We expect to appoint at least one independent Director to serve on the Compensation Committee during 2023. Compensation Philosophy and Objectives The major compensation objectives for the Company s executive officers are as follows: to attract and retain highly qualified individuals capable of making significant contributions to our long-term success; to motivate and reward named executive officers whose knowledge, skills, and performance are critical to our success; to closely align the interests of our named executive officers and other key employees with those of its shareholders; and to utilize incentive-based compensation to reinforce performance objectives and reward superior performance. Role of Chief Executive Officer in Compensation Decisions The Board approves all compensation for the chief executive officer. The Compensation Committee makes recommendations on the compensation for the chief executive officer and approves all compensation decisions, including equity awards, for our executive officers. Our chief executive officer makes recommendations regarding the base salary and non-equity compensation of other executive officers that are approved by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. Setting Executive Compensation The Compensation Committee believes that compensation for the Company s executive officers must be managed to what we can afford and in a way that allows for us to meet our goals for overall performance. During 2020 and 2019, the Compensation Committee and the Board compensated its Chief Executive Officers, President and Chief Financial Officer at the salaries indicated in the compensation table. This compensation reflected our financial condition. The Compensation Committee does not use a peer group of publicly traded and privately held companies in structuring the compensation packages. Executive Compensation Components for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 The Compensation Committee did not use a formula for allocating compensation among the elements of total compensation during the year that ended December 31, 2022. The Compensation Committee believes that in order to attract and retain highly effective people it must maintain a flexible compensation structure. For the year that ended December 31, 2022, the principal components of compensation for named executive officers were base salary. Base Salary Base salary is intended to ensure that our employees are fairly and equitably compensated. Generally, base salary is used to appropriately recognize and reward the experience and skills that employees bring to the Company and provides motivation for career development and enhancement. Base salary ensures that all employees continue to receive a basic level of compensation that reflects any acquired skills which are competently demonstrated and are consistently used at work. Base salaries for the Company s named executive officers are initially established based on their prior experience, the scope of their responsibilities and the applicable competitive market compensation paid by other companies for similar positions. Our officers were compensated as described above based on the financial condition of the Company. Performance-Based Incentive Compensation The Compensation Committee believes incentive compensation reinforces performance objectives, rewards superior performance and is consistent with the enhancement of stockholder value. All of the Company s Named Executive Officers are eligible to receive performance-based incentive compensation. The Compensation Committee did not recommend or approve payment of any performance-based incentive compensation to the Named Executive Officers during the year ended December 31, 2022 based on our financial condition. 19 Table of Contents Ownership Guidelines The Compensation Committee does not require our executive officers to hold a minimum number of our shares. However, to directly align the interests of executive officers with the interests of the stockholders, the Compensation Committee encourages each executive officer to maintain an ownership interest in the Company. Stock Option Program Stock options are an integral part of our executive compensation program. They are intended to encourage ownership and retention of the Company s common stock by named executive officers and employees, as well as non-employee members of the Board. Through stock options, the objective of aligning employees long-term interest with those of stockholders may be met by providing employees with the opportunity to build a meaningful stake in the Company. The Stock Option Program assists us by: - enhancing the link between the creation of stockholder value and long-term executive incentive compensation; - providing an opportunity for increased equity ownership by executive officers; and - maintaining competitive levels of total compensation. Stock option award levels are determined by the Compensation Committee and vary among participants positions within the Company. Newly hired executive officers or promoted executive officers are generally awarded stock options, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, at the next regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meeting on or following their hire or promotion date. In addition, such executives are eligible to receive additional stock options on a discretionary basis after performance criteria are achieved. Options are awarded at the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant or last trading day prior to the date of the grant. The Compensation Committee s policy is not to grant options with an exercise price that is less than the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. Generally, the majority of the options granted by the Compensation Committee vest quarterly over two to three years of the 5-10-year option term. Vesting and exercise rights cease upon termination of employment and/or service, except in the case of death (subject to a one-year limitation), disability or retirement. Stock options vest immediately upon termination of employment without cause or an involuntary termination following a change of control. Prior to the exercise of an option, the holder has no rights as a stockholder with respect to the shares subject to such option, including voting rights and the right to receive dividends or dividend equivalents. Retirement and Other Benefits We have no other retirement, savings, long-term stock award or other type of plans for the Named Executive Officers. Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits During the year ended December 31, 2022, we provided the Named Executive Officers with medical insurance and nominal health club benefits. The Company paid 14,225 in life insurance for Mr. Hegyi. No other perquisites or other personal benefits were provided to Named Executive Officers. The committee expects to review the levels of perquisites and other personal benefits provided to Named Executive Officers annually. Employment and consulting agreements are discussed below. Tax and Accounting Implications Deductibility of Executive Compensation Subject to certain exceptions, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") generally denies a deduction to any publicly held corporation for compensation paid to its chief executive officer and its three other highest paid executive officers (other than the principal financial officer) to the extent that any such individual's compensation exceeds 1 million. Performance-based compensation (as defined for purposes of Section 162(m)) is not taken into account for purposes of calculating the 1 million compensation limit, provided certain disclosure, shareholder approval and other requirements are met. We periodically review the potential consequences of Section 162(m) and may structure the performance-based portion of our executive compensation to comply with certain exceptions to Section 162(m). However, we may authorize compensation payments that do not comply with the exceptions to Section 162(m) when we believe that such payments are appropriate and in the best interests of the stockholders, after taking into consideration changing business conditions or the officer's performance. 20 Table of Contents Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based payments including its Stock Option Program in accordance with the requirements of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT The Compensation Committee, sets and administers policies that govern the Company's executive compensation programs, and incentive and stock programs. The Compensation Committee of the Company has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management and based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2022.

This compensation reflected the financial condition of the Company. In setting director compensation, we consider the significant amount of time that Directors expend in fulfilling their duties to the Company as well as the skill-level required by our members of the Board. On February 1, 2018, a director compensation program was implemented. The directors are compensated at up to 60,000 annually and the annual share award is based on the close price on January 31 of that year. During year ended December 31, 2022, neither Dave Dohrmann nor Marco Hegyi receive any compensation for his service as a director.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS The following table sets forth certain information regarding the ownership of our common stock as of March 31, 2023 by: each director and nominee for director; each person known by us to own beneficially 5 or more of our common stock; each officer named in the summary compensation table elsewhere in this report; and all directors and executive officers as a group. The amounts and percentages of common stock beneficially owned are reported on the basis of regulations of the SEC governing the determination of beneficial ownership of securities. Under the rules of the SEC, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power, which includes the power to vote or to direct the voting of such security, or investment power, which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Under these rules more than one person may be deemed a beneficial owner of the same securities and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which such person has no economic interest. Each beneficial owner named has sole voting and sole investment power with respect to all shares beneficially owned, subject to community property laws where applicable. The address of each beneficial owner is 11335 NE 122nd Way, Suite 105, Kirkland, WA 98034 and the address of more than 5 of common stock is detailed below.

Bucktown has rights to convert a Promissory Note into shares of the Issuer s common stock which, except for a contractual 9.99 cap on the amount of outstanding shares that Bucktown may own, would exceed the cap. Thus, the number of shares of the Issuer s common stock beneficially owned by Bucktown as of the date of its 13G filing was 11,052,305 shares, which is 9.99 of the Issuer's 110,633,688 shares outstanding on November 22, 2021 (as reporting in the company's 10-Q filed November 23, 2021).

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Review and Approval of Related Person Transactions We have operated under a Code of Conduct for many years. Our Code of Conduct requires all employees, officers and directors, without exception, to avoid the engagement in activities or relationships that conflict, or would be perceived to conflict, with the Company s interests or adversely affect its reputation. It is understood, however, that certain relationships or transactions may arise that would be deemed acceptable and appropriate upon full disclosure of the transaction, following review and approval to ensure there is a legitimate business reason for the transaction and that the terms of the transaction are no less favorable to the Company than could be obtained from an unrelated person. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all transactions with related persons. The Company reviews all relationships and transactions in which the Company and our directors and executive officers or their immediate family members are participants to determine whether such persons have a direct or indirect material interest. As required under SEC rules, transactions that are determined to be directly or indirectly material to the Company or a related person are disclosed.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of GrowLife, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, incurred negative cash flows from operating activities, and has an accumulated deficit that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the entity s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the entity s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Valuation of Derivative Liabilities Description of the Matter As disclosed in Note 7 to the financial statements, The Company has issued several convertible notes which were outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Under the terms of the note agreements, the note holders have the right to convert principal and accrued interest outstanding into shares of common stock at a discounted price compared to the market price of the common stock at the date of conversion. The embedded conversion features of the notes are recognized as derivative liabilities and management measures the fair value of the derivative liabilities using a Binomial Option Pricing Model. Auditing the Company s valuation of its derivatives is challenging as the valuation methodologies used by the Company are complex by their nature and the methodologies incorporate significant assumptions that impact the fair value measurement, including the discount rate and forecasted volatility of the Company s common stock price. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit To test the valuation of the derivative liabilities, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodologies used in the valuation model and testing the significant assumptions. For example, we compared the forecasted volatility of the Company s common stock price to its historical volatility. We also assessed the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data and engaged an external valuation specialist to assist in our evaluation of the significant assumptions and methodologies used by the Company. As part of our procedures, we also evaluated the Company s financial statement disclosures related to derivative liabilities which are included in Note 12 to the financial statements.
