PART I 

 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

BACKGROUND 

Ironstone Properties, Inc., Ironstone or the Company formerly named Ironstone Group, Inc. a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 1972. Since 1986, a majority of Ironstone s outstanding shares has been owned by Hambrecht Quist Group, a San Francisco-based investment banking and venture capital firm, and its affiliates (collectively H Q ). In September 2003, Ironstone repurchased all of these shares. Such repurchased shares are currently being held as treasury stock. William R. Hambrecht, Director and Chief Executive Officer, owns approximately 49.8 of Ironstone s outstanding voting shares as of December 31, 2022. During September 2021, Ironstone Group, Inc. changed its name to Ironstone Properties, Inc. 

BUSINESS STRATEGY 

Currently, the Company is reviewing options and new business opportunities. At December 31, 2022, the Company had 3,300 in marketable securities , 2,595 in cash, and 4,663,898 in non-marketable investments, 

There can be no assurance that the Company will acquire businesses, form additional alliances, or expand its existing services. Failure to expand the scope of services provided by the Company may have an adverse effect on the Company s results of operations. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had one part-time contract employee. The contract employee received 17,732 and 21,405 in cash compensation for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively, and are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

The Company s main assets are investments in non-marketable securities of TangoMe Inc., and Buoy Health, Inc., Aristotle Inc., and marketable securities of Arcimoto Inc. There can be no assurance that a market will continue to exist for these investments. 

The Company has been unable to contract a PCAOB auditor for an examination of the 2022 and 2021 financial statements and records. The Company continues to search for an auditor. 

Due to the Company not being able to secure an external audit, the SEC removed Ironstone Properties from Retail OTC and place the Company in the Expert Trading category of the OTC during September 2022, thereby reducing trading liquidity. 

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 

None. 

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 

The Company s principal executive offices are located at 909 Montgomery Street, San Francisco, California 94133, in office space leased by its WR Hambrecht+Co., LLC.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASE OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

Our common stock trades on the OTC Markets under the trading symbol IRNS. The table below sets forth, for the fiscal quarters indicated, the reported high and low sale prices of our common stock, as reported by the OTC Markets. These quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions. Also, due to the very limited and sporadic nature of trading in our common stock, we believe there is not an established public trading market in our common stock, and there can be no assurance that such a trading market will develop. The following table sets forth the range of high and low closing sale prices for our common stock for each period indicated:

Rules 15g-1 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on certain brokers-dealers who engage in transactions involving a penny stock. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. We believe that the penny stock rules may discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common shares. 

As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 500 holders of record of the Company s common stock. The Company has not paid cash dividends on its common stock since its inception and does not intend to pay cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future. 

On January 30, 2013 the Company granted 70,000 stock options to directors and officers of the Company. On August 20, 2013, the Company granted an additional 100,000 stock options to an employee of the Company. The option grants were intended as compensation for services provided to the Company. The options vested over four years and have a 10 year term. The exercise price of the stock options granted in January 2013 is 0.20 per share and for those granted in August 2013 is 1.20 per share. On April 29, 2021 the Company revised its existing Equity Incentive Plan. As of April 29, 2021, 175,000 options were granted under the Plan, with an exercise price of 1.99 per share, which is based on the weighted average price for the trailing six-month average price and an illiquidity discount of 15 . The options vest straight line over three years and expire seven years following the grant date. The plan provides for incentive stock options to be granted at times and prices determined by the Company s Board of Directors. The stock options are to be granted to directors, officers and employees of the Company, as well as certain consultants and other persons providing services to the Company. 

The stock options were issued in reliance on the exception from registration provided by Section 4(a) (2) of the Securities Act of 1933.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATION 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

While the Company continues to evaluate business opportunities, its sole source of revenue is from the sale of marketable and non-marketable securities. Management has classified these securities as available for sale in accordance with ASC Topic 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities . These securities are recorded at fair value, and any unrealized gains and losses are reported as other comprehensive income. For securities for which there is an other-than-temporary impairment, an impairment loss is recognized as a realized loss. 

Ironstone Property s primary expenses are generated from maintaining regulatory reporting compliance, such as quarterly review and annual audit of the financial statements, seeking legal counsel when appropriate, and consulting fees. 

Fair Value Measurements 

The accounting principles general accepted in the United States of America GAAP defines fair value, establishes a framework that the Company uses to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures about the fair value measurements included in the Company's financial statements. Refer to Note 2 in the Notes to Financial Statements for these disclosures. Fair value is defined by GAAP as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date. 

In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches. GAAP establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company s management. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect management s assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the observability of inputs as follows: 

Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 instruments. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment. 

Level 2 Valuations based on one or more quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 

Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 

5

Table of Contents 

The availability of observable inputs can vary from product to product and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether the product is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the management in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. 

In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 

Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company s own assumptions are set to reflect those that the Company believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 

Operating expenses for 2022 totaled 303,680 an increase of 69,705 or 30 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases in stock compensation expense of 57,046 and administrative expense of 14,474. Interest expense for fiscal year 2022 totaled 334,266, an increase of 44,840 or 15 as compared to fiscal year 2021, which is attributed to an increase in the Company's notes payable. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Net cash used in operating activities was 83,857 and 90,459 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease from fiscal year 2021 is attributed to expenses incurred during 2021 relating to restarting operations during 2021. Net cash used in investing activities was 200,000 and 178,824 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase is due to an investment made in non-marketable securities by the Company in fiscal year 2022. Net cash provided by financing activities was 202,000 and 300,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The Company has a line of credit arrangement with First Republic Bank with a borrowing limit of 350,000 with interest based upon the lender s prime rate plus 4.5 . Interest is payable monthly at 7.75 . The line is guaranteed by William R. Hambrecht, Chief Executive Officer and Director. The line of credit is due on demand and is secured by all of the Company s business assets. At December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance under the line was 348,843. 

On November 30, 2022 the Company renewed its note for five years, replacing the note issued April 1, 2012. The renewed terms are 7 interest rate, maturing November 30, 2027. The gross amounts payable under the agreement as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was 2,603,214 and 2,329,510 respectively. As part of the note renewal, a warrant was issued to the lender to purchase 319,021 common shares at 2.04 per share. The warrant has a five year term, expiring November 30, 2027. 

On May 27, 2022, William Hambrecht, CEO converted a total of 824,269 of debt and accrued interest for 404,054 shares of Ironstone Properties, Inc. common stock at a price of 2.04 per share. 

The Company may obtain additional equity or working capital through additional bank borrowings and public or private sales of equity securities and exercises of outstanding stock options. The Company may also borrow additional funds from Mr. William R. Hambrecht. There can be no assurance, however, that such additional financing will be available on terms favorable to the Company, or at all. 

While the Company explores new business opportunities, the primary capital resource of the Company relates to the March 30, 2012 purchase of 468,121 shares of non-marketable investment TangoMe, Inc. The investment in TangoMe, Inc. shares is valued at 4,303,369 and 4,781,521 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of 478,152 on the investment. Given that the investment in TangoMe, Inc. does not have a readily determinable fair value, the Company exerts significant judgment in estimating the fair value using various pricing models and the information available to the Company that it deems most relevant. The investment fair value is based on using a Best-fit valuation for TangoMe Inc. as determined by the MESE big data analysis system and SPAC inquiries for TangoMe, Inc. These are the primary significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s investment.

Deferred tax liability unrealized gain on marketable and non-marketable securities 

Less valuation allowance 

Deferred income tax asset (liability) net 

The reasons for the difference between the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to losses before income tax benefit and the actual income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: 

State income tax benefit (liability) net of federal tax 

Total before valuation allowance 

Change in valuation allowance 

Income tax benefit (liability) 

In the opinion of management, based on the uncertainty that the Company will be able to generate taxable income in the future, the realization of the loss carryforwards is not likely and, accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded to offset such amount in its entirety. 

The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and the state of California.

It is possible that subsequent ownership changes may limit the utilization of these tax attributes.

The remainder of the federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2018 and later have indefinite carryforward periods however are limited to 80 of taxable income in any given year. The California net operating loss carryforwards will expire in year 2028 through 2041.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) as of December 31, 2022 in connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10K. Based on that evaluation our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, in light of the material weakness described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Notwithstanding the material weakness, our Company s financial statements in this Form 10K fairly present in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of our company as of and for the periods presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting for the three-months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 

All internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Therefore, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time. 

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on those criteria because of the existence of the following material weaknesses: 

1) 

The Company does not have an adequate number of independent board members nor therefore an independent audit committee. 

2) 

Our limited number of employees results in the Company s inability to have a sufficient segregation of duties within its accounting and financial reporting activities. 

These absences constitute material weaknesses in the Company s corporate governance structure.
