 PART I 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 HISTORY 
 Free Flow, Inc. (the Company or Free Flow was incorporated on October 28, 2011 under the laws of State of Delaware to enter the green energy industry. The Company began with the idea of developing swimming pool solar pump system to create a blend of green energy harvesting while maintaining the present system. Having received firm enquiries from overseas farmers, Free Flow began with focus on the sale of solar panels to the agriculture sector, providing alternate means of electricity to operate pumps for water wells in India and Pakistan. In August 2014 the Company contracted to acquire as its subsidiary a special purpose entity in India but the contract was not effectuated due to the Sellers inability to comply with the terms of the contract, viz-a-viz to provide Audited Financial statements of the entity being acquired. 
 In February 2015, the company incorporated a subsidiary, Promedaff, Inc. and purchased a skin care product line and formulations for 2,000,000 against a promissory note. An e commerce platform was set up for sales and marketing. The efforts did not bear any success and the entire inventory was sold through the Seller and the Promissory Note was cancelled and marked VOID . 
 In October 2015, the company entered into a Sales Contract (the Sales Contract pursuant to which the Company contracted to sell to Salim's Paper Private Limited, Jaipur, India (the Purchaser ), with a principal place of business at SP-6 SKS Industrial Area, Reengus Sikar, Rajasthan, India 330 404; Tissue Paper comprising 30,000 Metric Tons (MT), to be shipped in five (5) years at the rate of 6,000 MT per annum. Shipments to commence within twelve (12) months from the date of signing of the Contract at a price to be determined on a quarterly basis based on the current index price for wood pulp as quoted on the Chicago Indes by FOEX Indexes, Ltd. In accordance with the terms of the Sales Contract the Purchaser has caused a pre-advice from their commercial bankers for a revolving commercial letter of credit in favor of the Registrant 
 
 In connection with effectuation of the Sales Contract, the Company worked to set up a paper manufacturing facility in the South East Asia or Middle East.

 COMPANY OVERVIEW 
 Since the new management took over the company s control on March 13, 2014, from S. Douglas Henderson, former CEO, it has remained focused in developing the solar energy business along with pharmaceutical (skin care product line), neither one of which had produced any revenues. However, the management continued its efforts to deploy Solar Well operation in India and Pakistan, due to economic instability no contract could be concluded. 
 
 Concurrent to the above efforts, a few prospects had shown keen interest in promotion of HYGIENiQ to the automotive industry. Approx.35 of the inventory was sold and paid for during the first quarter of 2016. 
 
 Upon taking over, the Company appointed Ferdinando (Fred) Ferrara as a Director and Sabir Saleem as CEO. There was no family relationship or other relationship between the Seller and the Purchaser. 
 
 On November 25, 2020, Mr. Shah Wali Khan was appointed to serve as a director of the Company.

 INCORPORATION OF SUBSIDIARIES 
 On January 24, 2015, Free Flow, Inc. incorporated Promedaff, Inc. in the Commonwealth of Virginia as its wholly-owned subsidiary. This subsidiary purchased a skin care product line and set up an e commerce platform for sale. The marketing efforts did not succeed; thus the entire inventory was sold back to the Sellers. Promedaff, Inc. was looking into developing other business. In October 2016, the name of Promedaff, Inc. was changed to Motors Metals, Inc. with the objectives to develop export business. A contract was signed with a United Emirates company. A trial shipment of approximately 12,000 was made from Germany but the business could not be continued due to poor management of the Agent that resulted from severe illness of the principal agent However, in March 2019, Motors Metals, Inc. received a letter of intent from an overseas customer indicating their willingness to buy 36,000 tons of processed scrap metal at market price. 
 Progress discussed below under Plan of Operations , see Item 7, Part II. 
 On September 11, 2019 a subsidiary was incorporated for the purpose of acquiring an intellectual property related to rotary engine but the transaction did not materialize.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 DUE TO FACTORS BEYOND HUMAN CONTROL, OUR BUSINESS IS A NOT STABLISED AND THERE ARE STILL THING TO HAPPEN AND THEREFORE RISKY. 
 We have not had a complete smooth year 2022; mainly due to COVID 19 that led to scarcity of skilled as well as unskilled workers. It was not easy to find wrecked and end of life vehicles and the prices had sky-rocked while the price of parts did not increase in the same ratio. Beginning January 2022, the company decided to suspend its used auto parts business and sold almost all its inventory as scrap metal. The business was focused on sale of scrap metal to overseas buyers. Due to political turmoil in the buyers country, the consistency of shipment could not be maintained. Potential investors should be made aware of the risk and difficulties being encountered by the company. 
 7 
 
 WE HAVE HISTORICALLY INCURRED LOSSES AND CANNOT ASSURE INVESTORS AS TO FUTURE PROFITABILITY. 
 Like most business that are dependent on a number of factors including but not limited to market conditions, and acts of God, like COVID 19, and political turmoil in the buyers country there can be no assurance to investors for future profitability. We had historically incurred losses from operations. However, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we have recognized a profit of 543,898; which sum is included in as other income and had resulted from the dismantling of automobiles and recovering of useable OEM parts, while the operating results showed a loss of 121,197.00. In the year 2022 we incurred an operating loss of 342,362; and the net adjusted loss due to sale of inventories amounted to 2,418,950. During the year 2021 the company made a gain in the amount of 691,657 due to inventory valuation based on actual recovery of saleable inventory upon dismantling of automobiles. 
 In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm's report on the Company's financial statements as of December 31, 2021 includes a going concern explanatory paragraph that describes substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in other than the normal course of business may be at amounts significantly different from those in the financial statements included in this registration statement . 
 WE HAVE A LACK OF LONG REVENUE HISTORY AND INVESTORS CANNOT VIEW OUR PAST PERFORMANCE SINCE WE HAVE LIMITED HISTORY. 
 We were formed on October 28, 2011, for engaging in any lawful business and any new enterprise. We have had moderate revenues in the last eleven years. We have only had operational activities during the last five to six years; during which period there have been more than one interruptions including Covid19 pandemic. We are cash surplus only to a limited extent and hence can be classified marginable cash surplus, and the business effort continue as if in an early development stage. We must be regarded as a new or developmental venture, and may be subject to unforeseen costs, expenses and problems. As a development venture, we may not be able to adequately forecast and budget our costs. It should be assumed that any or all these events could occur, with the result that anyone, if significant enough could prevent the proposed business from being successful and potential investors could lose all their investment. 
 BASED ON OUR CURRENT CASH RESERVES, WE WILL HAVE RELATIVELY SMALL OPERATIONAL BUDGET FOR THE OPERATIONS WHICH WE CANNOT EXPAND WITHOUT ADDITIONAL RAISING OF CAPITAL . 
 If we are unable to continue to generate enough revenue to cover our operational costs, we will need to seek additional sources of funds. Currently, we have no committed source for any additional funds as of date hereof. No representation is made that any funds will be available when needed. In the event funds cannot be raised when needed, we may not be able to carry out our business plan and could fail in business because of these uncertainties. 
 WE CANNOT GIVE ANY ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE ENOUGH CAPITAL TO FUND ACQUISITIONS AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. 
 We will need to raise additional funds to support not only our budget, but our expansion operations. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to raise such funds or whether we would be able to raise such funds with terms that are favorable to us. We may seek to borrow money from lenders at commercial rates, but such lenders will probably be at higher than bank rates, which higher rates could, depending on the amount borrowed, make the net operating income insufficient to cover the interest. 
 WE MAY IN THE FUTURE ISSUE MORE SHARES WHICH COULD DILUTE THE PERCENTAGE OF OWNERSHIP OF STOCKHOLDERS. 
 8 
 
 We may issue further shares as consideration for the cash or assets or services out of our authorized but unissued common stock that would, upon issuance dilute the percentage of shares holding of shareholders. 
 ONE OF OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IS A MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER OF THE COMPANY. AS SUCH THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF HIM CONTROLLING THE COMPANY TO THE DETRIMENT OF OUTSIDERS . 
 Mr. Saleem, President, CEO and Director, through direct and indirect ownership, is sole owner and shareholder of Redfield Holdings, Ltd. Redfield ), the majority shareholder of our Company. As such, he will be able to control the operations and the direction of the Company with very little outside influence. 
 Mr. Saleem does not hold direct shares of common stock of the Company. However, as an officer, director and beneficial shareholder of Redfield Holdings, Ltd. he can vote the shares of Redfield, our majority shareholder. As such, he is the beneficial holder of the 17,990,000 common shares and 10,000 Preferred Shares - Series A, held by Redfield. Through his ownership in Redfield, Mr. Saleem controls majority of the voting stock of the Company. 
 WE WILL DEPEND UPON MANAGEMENT, BUT WE WILL HAVE LIMITED PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT. 
 We currently have two individuals who are serving as our officers and directors for the Company, one of them on a full-time basis and one director who is not on full time basis. The full time directors are also acting as our officer. None of the officers have an employment agreement with the Company. We will be heavily dependent upon their skills, talents, and abilities, as well as several consultants to us, to implement our business plan, and may, from time to time, find that the inability of the officers and directors to devote their full-time attention to our business results in a delay in progress toward implementing our business plan. Because investors will not be able to manage our business, they should critically assess all the information concerning our officers and directors. 
 OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE NOT EMPLOYED BY US AND MAY CAUSE CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS AS TO CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE OR ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN. 
 In the future they may become, in their individual capacities, officers, directors, controlling shareholder and/or partners of other entities engaged in a variety of businesses. Thus, our officers and directors may have potential conflicts including their time and efforts involved in participation with other business entities. In some circumstances this conflict may arise between their fiduciary duties to us and their fiduciary duties to Redfield's business divisions. It is possible that in this situation their judgment maybe more consistent with their fiduciary duties to these ventures and may be detrimental to our interests. 
 Presently there is no requirement contained in our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, or minutes which requires officers and directors of our business to disclose to us business opportunities which come to their attention. Excluded from this duty would be opportunities which the person learns about through his involvement as an officer and director of another company. We have no intention of merging with or acquiring business opportunity from any affiliate or officer or director. 
 We do not know of any reason other than outside business interests that would prevent them from devoting full-time to our Company when the business may demand such full-time participation. 
 WE MAY DEPEND UPON OUTSIDE ADVISORS, WHO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON REASONABLE TERMS AND AS NEEDED. 
 9 
 
 To supplement the business experience of our officers and directors, we may be required to employ accountants, technical experts, appraisers, attorneys, or other consultants or advisors. Our Board, without any input from stockholders, will make the selection of any such advisors. Furthermore, we anticipate that such persons will be engaged on an as needed basis without a continuing fiduciary or other obligation to us. In the event we consider it necessary to hire outside advisors, we may elect to hire persons who are affiliates if they are able to provide the required services. 
 WE HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AS IS PROVIDED BY DELAWARE STATUTE. 
 Delaware Statutes provide for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees, and agents, under certain circumstances, against attorney's fees and other expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their association with or activities on our behalf. We will also bear the expenses of such litigation for any of our directors, officers, employees, or agents, upon such person's promise to repay us therefore if it is ultimately determined that any such person shall not have been entitled to indemnification. This indemnification policy could result in substantial expenditures by us that we will be unable to recoup. 
 RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR STOCK 
 OUR STOCK IS THINLY TRADED AND, AS A RESULT, YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL AT OR NEAR ASK PRICES OR AT ALL IF YOU NEED TO LIQUIDATE YOUR SHARES. 
 The shares of Free Flow common stock were approved for trading on the OTC Bulletin Board on April 3, 2013, the Company up-listed to QB in April 2021 and, as result, they are thinly-traded, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing the Company's common shares at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that the Company is a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if it came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven, early stage company such as Free Flow or purchase or recommend the purchase of any of the Company's Securities until such time as the Company became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in the Company's Securities is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on Securities price. We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for the Company's common securities will develop or be sustained, or that any trading levels will be sustained. Due to these conditions, the Company can give investors no assurance that they will be able to sell their shares at or near ask prices or at all if they need money or otherwise desire to liquidate their securities of the Company. 
 THE REGULATION OF PENNY STOCKS BY SEC AND FINRA MAY DISCOURAGE THE TRADABILITY OF OUR SECURITIES. 
 We are a penny stock company. Our securities currently trade in the OTC QB market and are subject to a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that imposes special sales practice requirements upon broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers or accredited investors. For purposes of the rule, the phrase accredited investors means, in general terms, institutions with assets more than 5,000,000, or individuals having a net worth more than 1,000,000 or having an annual income that exceeds 200,000 (or that, when combined with a spouse s income, exceeds 300,000). For transactions covered by the rule, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Effectively, this discourages broker-dealers from executing trades in penny stocks. Consequently, the rule will affect the ability of purchasers in this offering to sell their securities 
 10 
 
 in any market that might develop therefore because it imposes additional regulatory burdens on penny stock transactions. 
 In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted several rules to regulate penny stocks . Such rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Because our securities constitute penny stocks within the meaning of the rules, the rules would apply to us and to our securities. The rules will further affect the ability of owners of shares to sell our securities in any market that might develop for them because it imposes additional regulatory burdens on penny stock transactions. 
 Shareholders should be aware that, according to Securities and Exchange Commission, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced salespersons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired consequent investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be able to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. Inventory in penny stocks have limited remedies in the event of violations of penny stock rules. While the courts are always available to seek remedies for fraud against the Company, most, if not all, brokerages require their customers to sign mandatory arbitration agreements in conjunctions with opening trading accounts. Such arbitration may be through an independent arbiter. Investors may file a complaint with FINRA against the broker allegedly at fault, and FINRA may be the arbiter, under FINRA rules. Arbitration rules generally limit discovery and provide more expedient adjudication, but also provide limited remedies in damages usually only the actual economic loss in the account. Investors should understand that if a fraud case is filed against a company in the courts it may be vigorously defended and may take years and great legal expenses and costs to pursue, which may not be economically feasible for small investors. 
 The fact that we are a penny stock company will cause many brokers to refuse to handle transactions in the stocks, and may discourage trading activity and volume, or result in wide disparities between bid and ask prices. These may cause investors significant illiquidity of the stock at a price at which they may wish to sell or in the opportunity to complete a sale. Investors will have no effective legal remedies for these liquidity issues. 
 WE WILL PAY NO FORESEEABLE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE. 
 We have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not ever anticipate paying such dividends in the foreseeable future. Investors whose investment criteria is dependent on dividends should not invest in our common stock.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Free Flow, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements : We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Free Flow, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for the period then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, except for the effects of the going concern considerations as described in note 7 of the financial statements, as described below, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We were unable to obtain conclusive evidence as described in note 7 to support the Company's ability to increase additional sales through the future, the procurement of additional sales, the successful development of the Company's contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, to the attainment of profitable operations which are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 
 
 Basis for Opinion : These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 17 

Critical Audit Matters : The management listed the critical audit matters in the notes on accounts. They relate to the current period audit of the financial statements, and (1) Disclosures related to Going Concern (2) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (3) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. These critical audit matters do not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by referring the critical audit matters, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Provision for income tax 

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

 Net deferred income tax asset - The Company has recognized a valuation allowance for the deferred income tax asset since the Company cannot be assured that it is more likely than not that such benefit will be utilized in future years. The valuation allowance is reviewed annually. When circumstances change, and which cause a change in management's judgment about the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the impact of the change on the valuation allowance is generally reflected in current income.

 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
 Not applicable. 
 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(e)) are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a public company in the reports that if files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed. 
 To ensure that information required to be disclosed by a public company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of December 31, 2018, the Chief Executive Officer/Principal Accounting Officer has founded such controls and procedures to be ineffective as discussed further below. 
 MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. 
 Free Flow's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company in accordance with as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets; 
 (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Free Flow's management and directors; and 
 30 
 
 (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on Free Flow's financial statements. 
 Our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Accounting Officer, who is the same individual, has identified certain material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting relating to a shortage of accounting and reporting personnel due to limited financial resources and the size of our Company, as detailed below: 
 (1) The Company currently does not have but is in the process of developing formally documented accounting policies and procedures, which includes establishing a well-defined process for financial reporting. 
 (2) Due to the limited size of our accounting department, we currently lack the resources to handle complex accounting transactions. We believe this deficiency could lead to errors in the presentation and disclosure of financial information in our annual, quarterly, and other filings. 
 (3) As is the case with many companies of similar size, we currently have a lack of segregation of duties in the accounting department. Until our operations expand and additional cash flow is generated from operations, a complete segregation of duties within our accounting function will not be possible. 
 Considering the nature and extent of our current operations and any risks or errors in financial reporting under current operations and the fact that we have been a small business with limited employees, such items caused a weakness in internal controls involving the areas disclosed above. 
 Our Chief Executive Office/Principal Accounting Officer has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective as of December 31, 2015, due to the existence of the material weaknesses noted above that we have yet to fully remediate. 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to permanent rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this annual report. 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
