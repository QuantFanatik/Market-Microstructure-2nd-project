CAUTIONARY
NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The
information contained in this Report includes some statements that are not purely historical and that are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and as such, may involve risks and uncertainties. These
forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, perceived opportunities
in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other
characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. You can generally
identify forward-looking statements as statements containing the words anticipates, believes, continue, 
 could, estimates, expects, intends, may, might, plans, 
 possible, potential, predicts, projects, seeks, should, 
 will, would and similar expressions, or the negatives of such terms, but the absence of these words does
not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 

Forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the
forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on various assumptions, many of which are based,
in turn, upon further assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and forward-looking statements are expressed in good faith on the basis
of management s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made, but there can be no assurance that management s
expectations, beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished. 

In
addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere herein, the following are important factors that, in our view, could cause
actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements: technological advances, impact of competition,
dependence on key personnel and the need to attract new management, effectiveness of cost and marketing efforts, acceptances of products,
ability to expand markets and the availability of capital or other funding on terms satisfactory to us. We disclaim any obligation to
update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof. 

For
a discussion of the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could affect our future events, developments or results, you should carefully
review the Risk Factors set forth under Item 1. Description of Business below. Considering these risks, uncertainties
and assumptions, the future events, developments or results described by our forward-looking statements herein could turn to be materially
different from those we discuss or imply.

PART
I 

Item
1. Description of Business. 

Organization 

We
were incorporated in the State of Delaware as a for-profit company on March 2, 2015 and established a fiscal year end of December 31.
On March 4, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Correction to the Certificate of Incorporation to correct our name to Hubilu Venture Corporation
from Hubilu Venture Corp. On March 5, 2015, our incorporator adopted our bylaws and appointed our sole director. We were formed to provide
consulting and advisory services to real estate professionals and investors to assist them in finding properties and evaluating them
for purchase or leasing. We are not a real estate brokerage firm and do not engage in real estate brokerage activities. 

Our
services are focused on the research and analysis of real estate properties and advising clients on the best use of their real estate
assets. On August 18, 2016 we established a real estate acquisitions division seeking to raise money and acquire real estate assets. 

On
March 5, 2015, we issued 25,000,000 shares of our common stock, valued at 0.001 per share, to our founder, David Behrend for
 75,000 in cash or 0.003 per share. On April 30, 2015, Mr. Behrend transferred his shares to Jacaranda Investments, Inc., a Wyoming
corporation he previously owned, but sold on June 24, 2022, in exchange for 30,000 shares of Jacaranda s common
shares. From April 7, 2015 to May 7, 2015, we sold and issued 235,000 shares of our common stock at a price of 0.10 per share for
 23,500 to 40 accredited investors. On May 4, 2015, we issued 191,500 shares of our common stock, valued by our sole director at
 0.10 per share, or 19,150, to 12 individuals for services rendered to us. Six of these individuals had already purchased shares of
our common stock at the price of 0.10 per share. On October 1, 2016, we issued 100,000 shares to 5 individuals for share-based
compensation, valued by our sole director at 0.10 per share, for compensation of 50,000 for services rendered to us by them.
Presently, we estimate our monthly burn rate is approximately 12,000 per month, which consists of general and administrative
expenses, consulting fees, professional fees, property taxes, rent, repairs and maintenance, transfer agent and filings fees and
utilities. We believe that our revenues will cover our burn rate over the next 12 months. We believe that we may require
approximately 50,000 in either cash or from sale of our common stock, preferred stock, convertible note debt, or advances from our
majority shareholder, which has agreed to advance our working capital, if necessary, to accomplish the goals set out in our plan of
operation. We also intend to use our common stock to accomplish these goals to conserve our cash if we can negotiate the payment for
services with our shares. 

Our
principal business, executive and registered statutory office is located at 205 South Beverly Drive, Suite 205, Beverly Hills, CA 90212
and our telephone number is (310) 308-7887 and email contact is info@hubilu.com . Our URL address is www.hubilu.com .

Business 

We
were formed as a real estate consulting and acquisition firm that commenced operations in March 5, 2015, and, until June 2015, was limited
to organizational and business development activities. In June 2015, we entered into our first consulting agreement with a client. As
a real estate advisory and consulting company, we assist real estate investor professionals, as well as established companies, with advisory
and consulting services focused on providing research, analysis and acquisition opportunities to them. Our mission is to assist investors
and professionals in the early stage analysis of market opportunities and the evaluation of properties prior to them committing capital
for the purchase or the leasing of real estate properties. We are not real estate brokers and do not intend to offer brokerage services. 

Commencing
in June 2015, we engaged our first client, 112 South Eucalyptus Avenue, LLC, to assist it in evaluating the best use of its property. 

Real

Hubilu.com website to drive traffic and expand our investor and social media presence. This company also assisted us with launching our
student housing rental site, Hubiluhousing.com, which went live on March 16, 2018. This was a needed adjunct to assist with our aggressive
marketing of rentals and also allow our students ease to locate and sign rental contracts, which is all online now. 

On
January 4, 2018, we started to accept Crypto currency as a form of rental payment for our properties.

Real
Estate Consulting: 

Market
Opportunity 

We
believe the real estate consulting and advisory industries are sectors of the U.S. economy, which have seen increased activity since
interest rates are at their current levels. We believe that an attractive opportunity exists for a public company focused on assisting
real estate investors and users in evaluating real estate opportunities and we intend to provide services. We are focusing on the commercial
and residential rental real estate market. 

Historically,
the U.S. real estate industry has tended to be cyclical. The real estate market experienced a significant downturn from the 2007 peak
to a trough in 2009, representing the most severe downturn in property sales since at least 1990. Since 2009, real estate sales for transactions
of 1 million and above have increased by 97 and dollar volume has increased by 235 . The Los Angeles housing market forecast for the
3 years ending in 2021 is positive according to LittleBigHomes.com which estimates that the rising housing market prices in Los Angeles
is 6 annually during this period. If the Housing Market forecast is correct, home values will be higher at the end of 2021 than at
the end of 2018. This cyclical upturn has been, and we believe will continue to be, primarily driven by attractive yields, improving
property fundamentals and the availability and cost of financing. 

Attractive
Yields . According to CBRE Research and Reports, average commercial real estate yields (capitalization rates) for the four major property
types currently range from 2.00 to 7.00 , which compare equally to alternative investments such as stocks and bonds, while being secured
by real assets. We believe these steady growth yields will continue to drive capital inflows for commercial and residential real estate
investments. 

Availability
and Cost of Financing . The availability and low cost of debt financing has been a significant contributor to the recent improvement
in the U.S. capital markets and the U.S. commercial real estate market. Low interest rates and improved access to capital are key factors
fueling investment sales activity. 

7 

We
are focusing our business on the private client segment, as we believe it represents the largest and most active market segment in the
commercial real estate investment industry. We believe private clients, many of whom are individuals and partnerships, are impacted by
life or partnership changes that often override market and macroeconomic conditions. Due to these personal and partnership drivers, we
believe properties in this segment exhibit a high turnover rate. We believe private clients often take advantage of rising prices to
dispose of assets, refinance, acquire and/or exchange assets into new opportunities. The attractive financial results for property investment
provide the opportunity for redeployment of capital, which supports a high number of sales transactions. Additionally, the private client
segment is highly fragmented with many buyers, sellers and properties in different geographic regions and sectors. 

We
believe it is also the most underserved market segment and intend to offer our consulting services to private clients. We believe our
competition will come from brokerage firms, consulting departments of accounting and consulting firms and other real estate advisory
firms. 

Our
Business Strategy Consulting 

We
 intend to provide consulting and advisory services to our clients for fee-based compensation. We will negotiate our fees on a case-by-case
 basis and intend to offer hourly rates and flat fees for our services We intend to help provide our clients with the research and
 analysis to minimize their time to evaluate properties. We believe that our services will reduce time, costs and accelerate the time
 to enable the client to purchase or lease real estate without the pressure of commission sales professionals. 

Apply
 a structured consulting and asset management process to our clients. Web-based technology is becoming increasingly capital-efficient,
 and our model is optimized to leverage this trend using the Internet and various online research tools. 

We
will provide a variety of services to client companies, including the following: 

Analysis
 of current trends and transactions; 

Consulting
 on structure and financing including corporate formation services; 

Investment
 analysis of properties; 

Marketing,
 branding and public relations with respect to leasing and branding; 

Formulating
 operating strategies for the properties; 

Formulating
 other strategies designed to maximize property values, including tenant analysis; 

Relocation
 services; 

Introductions
 to potential joint venture partners; and 

Assisting
 in financial modeling. 

8 

We
believe that the services we offer to our future clients will be quality, value added services that will enable long term success for
them and us. 

We
intend to derive income from our clients for the performance of these services. We also intend to acquire and operate additional residential
rental properties and derive income from management fees and operating income. 

Financing
Strategy 

Our
ability to increase our revenues and market our services will dependent on additional outside financing, advances from our majority shareholder
and reinvesting our profits. Primary responsibility for the overall planning and management of our services will rest with our management.
For each service, we plan to offer, management will need to assess the market and our needs to offer such consulting or advisory services
at cost-effective prices to real estate investors and users. All decisions will be subject to budgetary restrictions and our business
control. We cannot provide any guarantee that we will be able to ever offer services on cost-effect terms. 

Competition 

The
real estate advisory and consulting services industry is highly competitive. We compete with a variety of companies, many of which have
greater financial and other resources than us, are subsidiaries or divisions of larger organizations. In particular, the industry is
characterized by a small number of large, dominant organizations that perform this service, such as real estate brokerage firms, accounting
firms, law firms, consultants as well as many companies that have greater financial and other resources than us. 

The
major competitive factors in our business are the timeliness and quality of service, the quality of work product the clients desire and
price. Our ability to compete effectively in providing customer service and quality services depends primarily on the level of training
of our future staff, the utilization of computer software and equipment and the ability to deliver our services in an effective and timely
manner. We believe we will compete effectively in these areas. 

Many
of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, managerial, marketing and other resources than we do, and they may
compete more effectively than we can. If our competitors offer services at lower prices than we do, we may have to lower the prices we
charge, which will adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, many of our competitors can obtain more experienced employees
than we can. 

Real
Estate Acquisitions/ Business Acquisitions: 

Market
Opportunity 

We
acquire student housing properties that are adjacent to the USC campus and other high-end universities which offer recession proof stability
and top of the market value on rents. 

Off
Campus Student Housing began in the mid 1990 s as an infancy industry with high growth potential, with many real estate investors
capitalizing on the premium rents and lack of housing on university campuses.

 Market Rents Year Round 

USC
Students are using the four Metro Stations in walking distance of USC Campus to access Downtown Los Angeles, including Staples Center,
LA Live, Nightlife Clubs and Bars, Entertainment Centers, Shopping Opportunities. 

Average
monthly rents of a unit in the USC area rose from approximately 750 in 2005 to 1,700 in 2021 and student enrollment at USC has grown
from 32,000 in 2005 to 49,700 in 2021-22, with 28,000 being graduate students. 

There
are also opportunities to develop multi-family properties within walking distance of the newly constructed Los Angeles Metro/subway stations,
taking advantage of upside density, zoning changes, and higher rents. 

In
 addition to on-demand car service availability, tenants benefit by being near the LA Metro/subway stations, eliminating the need
 and costs for personal vehicles and parking. 

Development
 opportunities will increase as the City encourages more density around the LA Metro/subway systems to help minimize vehicle congestion
 and pollution levels. 

Increased
 rents and development opportunities will result in higher values and a greater return on
 investment. 
 
 In
 2020 we started renting to transitional housing non-profits to take advantage of the City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles,
 State of California, and Federal government funding that is being made available to assist in the relocation of people to transitional
 housing. With USC going 90 offline during COVID and approximately 15,000 students not needing student housing, this proved prescient
 to help us keep our property occupancy rates high and our cash flow strong. The business has proved much less hands on than we originally
 thought, and rents are comparable to student housing. 

Acquisitions
 of profitable high growth businesses in the industries of Business Services (Property Management, Clean Tech (Green), Healthcare
 Services, I.T./Cloud) and e-Commerce (B2B, B2C) operating in Southern California. 

In
addition to investing in real estate, we intend to diversify our investment portfolio and expand our revenue sources to include the acquisitions
of profitable high growth businesses to increase our cash flow, including Property Management, CleanTech (Green), Healthcare, Intelligent
Technology/Cloud, and e-Commerce (B2B, B2C). 

Our
Business Strategy 

Seek
 out and acquire Real Estate which management believes has limited downside risk, is recession proof, and is in the path of growth
 to facilitate high rental income upside and equity appreciation. 

Purchase
 single family and multi-family properties and portfolios, either at discounted prices or which require cosmetic renovations, to maximize
 cash flow and equity appreciation in the shortest possible time. 

Undertake
 development projects that involve material construction and/or renovations to realize the highest and best use upside value with
 significant long term investment returns. 

Acquire
 business opportunities that bring in high cash flow, with low risk, that expands our portfolio, offset our current and expanding
 operating costs, and allow us to grow our real estate acquisition division. 

Focus
 on below-market or other non-listed opportunities 

Our
 goal is to acquire 5 properties over the next 12 months 

10 

Financing
Strategy 

Our
ability to increase our revenues, net profit and cash flow will be dependent on our ability to acquire more properties, additional bank
and outside financing, advances from our majority shareholder and reinvesting our profits. Primary responsibility for the overall planning
and management of our services will rest with our management. For each acquisition, management will need to assess the market and the
ability to make a profit from rental income less expenses and cost of capital of the potential acquisitions. 

Competition 

The
real estate student housing acquisition and rental industry is highly competitive. We compete with a variety of individuals and companies,
many of which have greater financial and other resources than us or are subsidiaries or divisions of larger organizations. In particular,
the industry is characterized by a small number of large, dominant organizations that perform this service. 

The
major competitive factors in our business are our ability to compete effectively in providing students, quality housing at an affordable
price, maintaining properties in excellent condition and obtaining market rents from tenants. We believe we will compete effectively
in these areas. 

Many
of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, managerial, marketing and other resources than we do, and they may
compete more effectively than we can. If our competitors offer services at lower rental prices than we do, we may have to lower the prices
we charge, which will adversely affect our results of operations. 

Intellectual
Property Rights 

We
do not currently have any intellectual property rights. 

Our
Website 

Our
website is located at www.hubilu.com and, it provides a description of our company, our services, our mission statement, along
with our contact information including our address, telephone number and e-mail address. 

Dependence
on Customers 

We
are pursuing a real estate acquisition strategy as well as seeking new customers. 

Trademarks
and Patents 

We
do not have any registered trademarks or patents. 

Need
for any Government Approval of Principal Services 

We
are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applied to businesses, such as payroll taxes on the state
and federal levels. Sales of the services we intend to provide to customers may be subject to U.S. and local government regulations. 

Research
and Development 

We
have not spent any money on research and development activities. 

Employees 

Presently,
we do not have any employees other than our officers and sole director who devote their time as needed to our business and expect to
devote 40 hours per week. 

11 

Summary 

We
have and continue to provide consulting services for several clients and are now seeking real estate acquisitions to complement our 24
existing properties. We anticipate that our revenues will increase as we secure additional clients and acquire properties in the next
twelve months. 

The
closing of these contemplated transactions is subject to due diligence clear title. We believe that our revenues will cover our operating
costs over the next 12 months; however, our majority shareholder has agreed to advance us necessary working capital, if necessary. We
currently have one officer and a sole director. These individuals allocate time and personal resources to us on a part-time basis and
devote approximately 40 hours per week to us. 

As
of the date of this Report, we have 26,237,125 shares of 0.001 par value common stock issued and outstanding, which is owned by 76 shareholders.
We have 520,400 shares of our Series 1 convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2022, which is held by 14
shareholders. The aggregate market value of our common stock based on the most recent price quoted on the OTC Markets of 0.21 per share
is 5,509,796. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2022 is 1,740,795. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

We
are subject to those financial risks generally associated with startup enterprises. Since we have sustained losses since Date of Incorporation,
we will require financing to fund our development activities and to support our operations and will independently seek additional financing.
However, we may be unable to obtain such financing. We are also subject to risk factors specific to our business strategy and the entertainment
industry. 

RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH OUR COMPANY AND INDUSTRY 

Since
we are a real estate consulting and acquisitions company, we have just begun to generate revenues and lack an established operating history,
an investment in the shares offered herein is highly risky and could result in a complete loss of your investment if we are unsuccessful
in our business plans. 

Although
we have revenues from the rental properties owned by our subsidiaries, we have an accumulated deficit of 1,740,795. Such prospects must
be considered given the substantial risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by new entrants into the real estate consulting industry.
Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is highly dependent upon several factors, including our ability
to secure clients and acquire profitable real estate properties. Based upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future
periods as we incur expenses associated with our business. Further, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in increasing our
revenues or in achieving or sustaining positive cash flow at any time in the future. Any such failure could result in the possible closure
of our business or force us to seek additional capital through loans or additional sales of our equity securities to continue business
operations, which would dilute the value of any shares you purchase in this offering. 

As
a public company, we must comply with numerous financial reporting and legal requirements, including those pertaining to audits and internal
control. The costs of this compliance could be significant. If our revenues are insufficient, and/or we cannot satisfy many of these
costs through the issuance of our shares, we may be unable to satisfy these costs in the normal course of business that would result
in our being unable to continue as a going concern. 

12 

Our
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, disclose that we can continue as a going concern. However, if necessary, our
officers may be unable or unwilling to loan or advance us any funds. 

Our
future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from our consulting services. We plan
to seek additional funds through private placements of our common or preferred stock. Private placements of our common or preferred stock
may involve substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in
the event we cannot continue in existence. 

Our
officers and directors have limited experience in the real estate consulting industry, which could prevent us from successfully obtaining
clients for the Consulting part of our business plan and impede our ability to earn Consulting revenue. 

Our
officers and directors have experience in the real estate industry but limited experience in the consulting sector. While our president
has been an agent, broker, property manager and principal, he has limited experience in real estate consulting to third parties. Our
management s lack of experience could hinder their ability to successfully consult on real estate projects that will result in
clients retaining our services. It is likely that our management s inexperience with real estate consulting will hinder our ability
to earn revenue. Each potential investor must carefully consider the lack of experience of our officers and directors before purchasing
our common stock. 

Our
officer and director have limited experience in operating a public company, which could prevent us from successfully implementing our
business plan and impede our ability to earn revenue. 

Our
officer and sole director have limited experience in operating a public company. While they have experience in operating companies, their
limited experience in operating a public company could hinder their ability to successfully comply with the reporting and other requirements
imposed on public companies. It is likely that our management s limited experience with operating a public company will hinder
our ability to earn revenue and comply with various reporting requirements. Each potential investor must carefully consider the lack
of experience of our officer and director before purchasing our common stock. 

Key
management personnel may leave us, which could adversely affect our ability to continue operations. 

We
are entirely dependent on the efforts of David Behrend, our president, chief executive officer and sole director as well as our officers.
The loss of our officers and sole director, or of other key personnel hired in the future, could have a material adverse effect on the
business and its prospects. There is currently no employment contract by and between any office/director and us. Also, there is no guarantee
that replacement personnel, if any, will help us to operate profitably. They have been and continue to expect to be able to commit approximately
40 hours per week of their time, to the development of our business plan in the next six months. If management is required to spend additional
time with their outside employment, they may not have sufficient time to devote to us and we would be unable to develop our business
plan resulting in the business failure. 

We
do not maintain key person life insurance on our officers and sole director. 

If
we are unable to obtain additional funding our business operation will be harmed, and if we do obtain additional funding, our then existing
shareholders may suffer substantial dilution. 

We
have limited financial resources. As of December 31, 2022, we had 92,068 of cash on hand and total assets of 17,089,666. If we are
unable to develop our business or secure additional funds our business would fail, and our shares may be worthless. We may seek to obtain
debt financing as well. There is no assurance that we will not incur debt in the future, that we will have sufficient funds to repay
any indebtedness, or that we will not default on our debt obligations, jeopardizing our business viability. Furthermore, we may not be
able to borrow or raise additional capital in the future to meet our needs, or to otherwise provide the capital necessary to conduct
our business. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The inability
to obtain additional capital will restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations.
If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we will likely be required to curtail our business plans and possibly cease our operations.
Any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing shareholders. 

In
the future, we may seek additional financing through the sale of our common or preferred stock resulting in dilution to existing shareholders. 

The
most likely source of future financing presently available to us is through the sale of shares of our common or preferred stock. Any
sale of common or preferred stock will result in dilution of equity ownership to existing shareholders. This means that, if we sell shares
of our common or preferred stock, more shares will be outstanding and each existing shareholder will own a smaller percentage of the
shares then outstanding, which will result in a reduction in the value of an existing shareholder s interest. To raise additional
capital, we may have to issue additional shares, which may substantially dilute the interests of existing shareholders. Alternatively,
we may have to borrow large sums, and assume debt obligations that require us to make substantial interest and capital payments. 

We
cannot guarantee we will be successful in generating revenue in the future or be successful in raising funds through the sale of shares
to pay for our business plan and expenditures. Failure to generate additional revenue may cause us to go out of business, which may result
in the complete loss of your investment. 

13 

Competition
in the real estate consulting industry is strong. 

The
marketplace in which we compete is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Our competitors include well-established enterprises.
Some of these competitors are based globally. We anticipate that we will face additional competition from new entrants that may offer
significant performance, price, creative or other advantages over those offered by us. Many of these competitors have greater name recognition
and resources than us. 

Additionally,
potential competitors with established market shares and greater financial resources may introduce competing projects. Thus, there can
be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competition will not have a material adverse effect
on our operations. Increased competition could result in lower than expected operating margins or loss of the ability to engage distributors
of their productions, either of which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition. 

We
operate in a regulated industry and changes in regulations or violations of regulations may result in increased costs or sanctions that
could reduce our revenues and profitability. 

The
real estate consulting industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations related to safety, conduct
of operations, and payment for services. If we fail to comply with the laws and regulations that are directly applicable to our business,
we could suffer civil and/or criminal penalties or be subject to injunctions and delays in production schedules orders. 

Federal
and state governments may regulate certain aspects of the real estate industry. Our ability to cost effectively market our services as
they related to real estate projects could be affected by such regulations. The implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable
interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs, cause
the development of the affected markets to become impractical and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. 

Our
officer and sole director are required to commit time to our affairs and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating management
time among various business activities. During other business activities, they may become aware of business opportunities that may be
appropriate for presentation to us, as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. As such, there may be conflicts of
interest in determining to which entity a business opportunity should be presented. 

To
resolve such potential conflicts of interest, our officers and sole director have agreed that any opportunities that they are aware of
independently or directly through their association with us (as opposed to disclosure to them of such business opportunities by management
or consultants associated with other entities) would be presented by them solely to us. 

We
cannot provide assurances that our efforts to eliminate the potential impact of conflicts of interest will be effective. 

Since
the effective date of our registration statement, we are required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. To comply with these requirements, our independent registered public accounting
firm must review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover, our legal
counsel should review and assist in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot
be accurately predicted now because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports
cannot be determined now and will have a major effect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence
of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements
and earn a profit. We may be exposed to potential risks resulting from any new requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors
could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock, if a market ever develops, could
drop significantly. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(f), internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive
and principal financial officer and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
 of management and/or our directors; and 

provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

14 

Our
internal controls may be inadequate or ineffective, which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation
being disseminated to the public. Investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision. 

We
have only one director. Accordingly, we cannot establish board committees comprised of independent members to oversee functions like
compensation or audit issues. In addition, since we only have one director, he has significant control over all corporate issues. We
do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors. Our sole director performs these functions and is
not an independent director. Thus, there is a potential conflict in that sole director is also engaged in management and participates
in decisions concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management performance. 

Until
we have a larger board of directors that would include some independent members, if ever, there will be limited oversight of our director s
decisions and activities and little ability for minority shareholders to challenge or reverse those activities and decisions, even if
they are not in the best interests of minority shareholders. 

If
our real estate property prices and rents begin to fall, or we do not generate revenues from tenant rentals to cover our property expenses,
our business would fail. 

Real
estate projects involve substantial risks, because it requires that we spend significant funds based entirely on our preliminary evaluation
of rental income from potential tenants. It is impossible to predict the success of any project. The ability of a real estate project
to be commercially successful can depend upon a variety of unpredictable factors, including: 

Tenants
 or investors taste, which is always subject to change; 

The
 quantity and popularity of other real estate projects in the vicinity; 

The
 competition for real estate and rental units 

We
will rely upon consultants for web-further enhancement and maintenance of our website and the consultant may not maintain it in a manner
that is necessary to promote and recruit personnel and potential clients effectively. 

We
have developed a website that will help us attract personnel and clients. It is a basic website to located at www.hubilu.com .
We intend to use the website as a promotional and recruiting tool for potential clients as well as a tool for soliciting projects to
consult on with real estate owners. We intend to constantly monitor and make improvements to our website. If we do not further develop
our website, we may not be able to adequately access clients or projects to develop consulting revenues. 

RISKS
RELATED TO THE OWNERSHIP OF OUR SECURITIES 

Investors
may lose their entire investment if we fail to implement our business plan. 

As
a real estate consulting and acquisition company that commenced operations in June 2015, and we expect to face substantial risks, uncertainties,
expenses and difficulties. We were formed on March 2, 2015. We have a limited demonstrable operations record, on which you can evaluate
our business and prospects. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10K, our operations have been devoted to implementing our business
plan, acquiring 15 properties, and looking for investment opportunities whereby we can acquire real property and operate it. We cannot
guarantee that we will be successful in accomplishing our objectives. In addition, our lack of operating capital could negatively impact
the value of our common shares and could result in the loss of your entire investment. 

Participation
is subject to risks of investing in micro capitalization companies. 

Micro
capitalization companies generally have limited product lines, markets, market shares and financial resources. The securities of such
companies, if traded in the public market, may trade less frequently and in more limited volume than those of more established companies.
Additionally, in recent years, the stock market has experienced a high degree of price and volume volatility for the securities of micro
capitalization companies. Micro capitalization companies that trade in the over-the-counter markets have experienced wide price fluctuations
not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies. 

There
has not been any established trading market for our common stock, and there is currently a limited public market for our securities.
Our shares are quoted on the OTC Pink. There can be no assurances as to whether: 

(i) 
 any
 market for our shares will develop; 

(ii) 
 the
 prices at which our common stock will trade; or 

(iii) 
 the
 extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the development of an active, liquid trading market. Active trading markets
 generally result in lower price volatility and more efficient execution of buy and sell orders for investors. 

15 

In
addition, our common stock is unlikely to be followed by any market analysts, and there may be few institutions acting as market makers
for our common stock. Either of these factors could adversely affect the liquidity and trading price of our common stock. Until our common
stock is fully distributed and an orderly market develops in our common stock, if ever, the price at which it trades is likely to fluctuate
significantly. Prices for our common stock will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors, including the
depth and liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock, developments affecting our business, including the impact of the factors
referred to elsewhere in these Risk Factors, investor perception of us and general economic and market conditions. No assurances can
be given that an orderly or liquid market will ever develop for the shares of our common stock. 

Because
of the anticipated low price of the securities being registered, many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in these
securities. Purchasers of our securities should be aware that any market that develops in our stock would be subject to the penny stock
restrictions. 

The
trading of our securities will be in the over-the-counter market, which is commonly referred to as the OTC Markets. Thus, an investor
may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the price of our securities. 

Rule
3a51-1 of the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a penny stock, for purposes relevant to us, as any equity security
that has a minimum bid price of less than 4.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than 4.00 per share, subject to a limited
number of exceptions that are not available to us. It is likely that our shares will be a penny stock for the immediately foreseeable
future. This classification severely and adversely affects any market liquidity for our common stock. 

For
any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the penny stock rules require that a broker or dealer approve a person s
account for transactions in penny stocks and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting
forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. To approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks,
the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives of the person and make a reasonable determination
that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that that person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial
matters to evaluate the risks of transactions in penny stocks. 

The
broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to
the penny stock market, which, in highlight form, sets forth: 

the
 basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination, and 

that
 the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. 

Disclosure
also must be made about the risks of investing in penny stock in both public offerings and in secondary trading and commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available
to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Additionally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information
for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. 

Because
of these regulations, broker-dealers may not wish to engage in the above-referenced necessary paperwork and disclosures and/or may encounter
difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock, which may affect the ability of selling shareholders or other holders
to sell their shares in any secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in any secondary market. These
additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities, if our securities become publicly traded.
In addition, the liquidity for our securities may decrease, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities. Our shares
probably will be subject to such penny stock rules for the foreseeable future and our shareholders will, in all likelihood, find it difficult
to sell their securities. 

Our
management believes that the market for penny stocks has suffered from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include: 

Control
 of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; 

Manipulation
 of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; 

Boiler
 room practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by sales persons; 

16 

Excessive
 and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and 

Wholesale
 dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with
 the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor losses. 

There
is currently a limited public market for our common stock, and there can be no assurance that any established public market would develop
in the foreseeable future. Transfer of our common stock may also be restricted under the securities or securities regulations laws promulgated
by various states and foreign jurisdictions, commonly referred to as Blue Sky laws. Absent compliance with such individual
state laws, our common stock may not be traded in such jurisdictions. Because the securities registered hereunder have not been registered
for resale under the blue-sky laws of any state, the holders of such shares and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market
that might develop in the future, should be aware that there may be significant state blue-sky law restrictions upon the ability of investors
to sell the securities and of purchasers to purchase the securities. These restrictions prohibit the secondary trading of our common
stock. We currently do not intend to and may not be able to qualify securities for resale in at least 17 states which do not offer manual
exemptions (or may offer manual exemptions) and require shares to be qualified before they can be resold by our shareholders. Accordingly,
investors should consider the secondary market for our securities to be a limited one. 

Because
insiders control our activities, they may cause us to act in a manner that is most beneficial to them and not to outside shareholders,
which could cause us not to take actions that outside investors might view favorably, and which could prevent or delay a change in control . 

David
Behrend, our chairman, chief executive officer and president, controls Jacaranda3 Investments, Inc., which owns 25,000,000 common shares
representing 95 of the outstanding common stock. Jacaranda3 Investments, Inc., purchased the common stock from Jacaranda Investments,
Inc. on January 3, 2021. Thus, it effectively controls all matters requiring director and stockholder approval, including the election
of directors, the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers and related party transactions. This insider also can
delay or perhaps even block, by its ownership of our stock, an unsolicited tender offer. This concentration of ownership could have the
effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company that you might view favorably. 

Our
sole director has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued common shares.
Such issuances may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management and the interests of existing management
which may not be the same as the interests of other shareholders. Our ability to issue shares without shareholder approval serves to
enhance existing management s ability to maintain control of us. 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation at Article Ten provides for indemnification as follows: No director shall be personally liable to
the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty by such director as a director. Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence, a director shall be liable to the extent provided by applicable law, (i) for breach of the director s duty
of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct
or a knowing violation of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or (iv) for any transaction from
which the director derived an improper personal benefit. No amendment to or repeal of this Article Tenth shall apply to or have any effect
on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director
occurring prior to such amendment. 

We
have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws is against public
policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification for
liabilities arising under federal securities laws, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or
controlling person in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by a director, officer or controlling person
in connection with our activities, we will (unless in the opinion of our counsel, the matter has been settled by controlling precedent)
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the question whether indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The legal process relating to this matter if it were to
occur is likely to be very costly and may result in us receiving negative publicity, either of which factors is likely to materially
reduce the market and price for our shares, if such a market ever develops. 

Except
for the 235,000 shares that were registered pursuant to our registration statement, 359,500 shares that had the restrictive legend
removed under Rule 144 and 254,265 shares held by Jacaranda Investments, Inc., that had the restrictive legend removed under Rule
144, the remaining outstanding shares of common stock (25,103,360 shares are restricted securities as defined under
Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and may only be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption
from registration, if available. Rule 144 provides that a person who is not an affiliate and has held restricted securities for a
prescribed period of at least six (6) months if purchased from a reporting issuer or twelve (12) months if purchased from a
non-reporting Company, may, under certain conditions, sell all or any of his shares without volume limitation, in brokerage
transactions. Affiliates, however, may not sell shares more than 1 of the Company s outstanding common stock every three
months. Because of revisions to Rule 144 which became effective on February 15, 2008, there is no limit on the amount of restricted
securities that may be sold by a non-affiliate (i.e., a stockholder who has not been an officer, director or control person for at
least 90 consecutive days) after the restricted securities have been held by the owner for the prescribed period. A sale under Rule
144 or under any other exemption from the Act, if available, or pursuant to registration of shares of common stock of present
stockholders, may have a depressive effect upon the price of the common stock in any market that may develop. 

We
have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable
future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings, capital requirements, financial requirements and other
factors that our sole director will consider. Since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock, return on your investment,
if any, will depend solely on an increase, if any, in the market value of our common stock. We pay a 5 dividend on our Series 1 convertible
preferred stock, which is paid in kind.

The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rule changes proposed and enacted by the SEC, the New York and American Stock Exchanges and the
Nasdaq Stock Market, because of Sarbanes-Oxley, requires the implementation of various measures relating to corporate governance. These
measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and apply to securities that are listed
on those exchanges or the Nasdaq Stock Market. Because we are not presently required to comply with many of the corporate governance
provisions and because we chose to avoid incurring the substantial additional costs associated with such compliance any sooner than legally
required, we have not yet adopted these measures. 

Because
our sole director is not an independent director, we do not currently have independent audit or compensation committees. Thus, this sole
director has the ability, among other things, to determine his own level of compensation. Until we comply with such corporate governance
measures, regardless of whether such compliance is required, the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders
without protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest, if any, and similar matters and investors may be
reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to expand our operations. 

We
intend to comply with all corporate governance measures relating to director independence as and when required. However, we may find
it very difficult or be unable to attract and retain qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide
for our effective management because of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has resulted in a
series of rules and regulations by the SEC that increase responsibilities and liabilities of directors and executive officers. The perceived
increased personal risk associated with these recent changes may make it costlier or deter qualified individuals from accepting these
roles. 

You
may have limited access to information regarding our business because our obligations to file periodic reports with the SEC could be
automatically suspended under certain circumstances. 

As
of the effective date of our registration statement, October 27, 2015, we became subject to certain informational requirements of the
Exchange Act, as amended and we are required to file periodic reports (i.e., annual, quarterly and special reports) with the SEC which
will be immediately available to the public for inspection and copying. Except during the year that our registration statement becomes
effective, these reporting obligations may (in our sole discretion) be automatically suspended under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act
if we have less than 300 shareholders and do not file a registration statement on Form 8A. We filed a Form 8A. However, we will not be
required to furnish proxy statements to security holders and our director, officers and principal beneficial owners will not be required
to report their beneficial ownership of securities to the SEC pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act until we have both 500 or more
security holders and greater than 10 million in assets. This means that your access to information regarding our business will be limited. 

We
will incur ongoing costs and expenses for SEC reporting and compliance; without revenue, we may not be able to remain in compliance,
making it difficult for investors to sell their shares, if at all. 

To
be eligible for quotation on the OTC Markets, we must remain current in our filings with the SEC. Market makers are not permitted to
begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTC Markets that become
delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 or 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing
during that time. For us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise
a substantial portion of our available cash resources. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may
be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. 

For
all the foregoing reasons and others set forth herein, an investment in our securities in any market that may develop in the future involves
a high degree of risk.

From
April 2015 to February 2016, our executive, administrative and operating offices were located at 9777 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 804,
Beverly Hills, CA 90212. We did not have a written lease with the landlord and an unrelated third party provided us with space, on a
month-to-month basis, for no cost. On March 4, 2016, we executed a written lease for 750 square feet of space for 2,200 per month. Jacaranda Investments, Inc., advanced us the first month prorated rent of 1,703 and 6,600 for the landlord s security deposit. Our current lease, which changed on June 1, 2020, is
now 375 square feet of space on a month to month basis and is 1,300 per month.

We
have 520,400 shares of our Series 1 convertible preferred stock that is convertible into shares of our common stock. The conversion provisions
are discussed in our footnotes to our financial statements. In general, under Rule 144, a holder of restricted common shares who is an
affiliate at the time of the sale or any time during the three months preceding the sale can resell shares, subject to the restrictions
described below. 

If
we have been a public reporting company under the Exchange Act for at least 90 days immediately before the sale, then at least six months
must have elapsed since the shares were acquired from us or one of our affiliates, and we must remain current in our filings for an additional
period of six months; in all other cases, at least one year must have elapsed since the shares were acquired from us or one of our affiliates. 

The
number of shares sold by such person within any three-month period cannot exceed the greater of: 

1 
 of the total number of our common shares then outstanding; or 

The
 average weekly trading volume of our common shares during the four calendar weeks preceding the date on which notice on Form 144
 with respect to the sale is filed with the SEC (or, if Form 144 is not required to be filed, the four calendar weeks preceding the
 date the selling broker receives the sell order) This condition is not currently available to the Company because its securities
 do not trade on a recognized exchange. 

Conditions
relating to the manner of sale, notice requirements (filing of Form 144 with the SEC) and the availability of public information about
us must also be satisfied. 

19 

26,237,125
of the presently outstanding shares of our common stock are restricted securities as defined under Rule 144 promulgated
under the Securities Act and may only be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from registration, if available.
The SEC has adopted final rules amending Rule 144, which have become effective on February 15, 2008. Pursuant to the new Rule 144, one
year must elapse from the time a shell company, as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act and Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange
Act, ceases to be a shell company and files a Form 8-K addressing Item 5.06 with such information as may be required in
a Form 10 registration statement with the SEC, before a restricted shareholder can resell their holdings in reliance on Rule 144. Form
10 information is equivalent to information that a company would be required to file if it were registering a class of securities on
Form 10 under the Exchange Act. Under the amended Rule 144, restricted or unrestricted securities that were initially issued by a reporting
or non-reporting shell company or a company that was at any time previously a reporting or non-reporting shell company can only be resold
in reliance on Rule 144 if the following conditions are met: 

1. 
 the
 issuer of the securities that was formerly a reporting or non-reporting shell company has ceased to be a shell company; 

2. 
 the
 issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; 

3. 
 the
 issuer of the securities has filed all reports and material required to be filed under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as
 applicable, during the preceding twelve months (or shorter period that the Issuer was required to file such reports and materials),
 other than Form 8-K reports; and 

4. 
 at
 least one year has elapsed from the time the issuer filed the current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status
 as an entity that is not a shell company. 

We
do not believe we are classified as a shell company under Rule 405 of the Securities Act Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

Current
Public Information 

In
general, for sales by affiliates and non-affiliates, the satisfaction of the current public information requirement depends on whether
we are a public reporting company under the Exchange Act: 

If
 we have been a public reporting company for at least 90 days immediately before the sale, then the current public information requirement
 is satisfied if we have filed all periodic reports (other than Form 8-K) required to be filed under the Exchange Act during the 12
 months immediately before the sale (or such shorter period as we have been required to file those reports). 

If
 we have not been a public reporting company for at least 90 days immediately before the sale, then the requirement is satisfied if
 specified types of basic information about us (including our business, management and our financial condition and results of operations)
 are publicly available. 

However,
no assurance can be given as to: 

the
 likelihood of a market for our common shares developing, 

the
 liquidity of any such market, 

the
 ability of the shareholders to sell the shares, or 

the
 prices that shareholders may obtain for any of the shares. 

No
prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares or the availability of shares for future sale will have
on the market price prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of our common shares, or the perception that such sales
could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of the common shares.

Voting
 The holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock
into which such shares of Preferred Stock could be converted. 

Change

 0.50 per share or a ten percent (10 discount to the average closing bid price of the common stock 5 days prior to the notice of conversion.
The Preferred Stock is also subject to certain adjustments for dilution, if any, resulting from future stock issuances, including for
any subsequent issuance of common stock at a price per share less than that paid by the holders of the Preferred Stock. 

Dividends
 The holders of the Preferred Stock in preference to the holders of common stock, are entitled to receive, if and when declared
by the Board of Directors, dividends at the rate of 0.05 per share per annum, in kind, which shall accrue quarterly. Such dividends
are cumulative. No such dividends have been declared to date. In addition, the holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive

shares into which a share of Preferred Stock may be convertible.

 In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or sale or merger of the Company, whether voluntarily or involuntarily,

with this discussion. 

Results
of Operations 

General 

We
are a startup enterprise that commenced operations on March 5, 2015, which, until June 2015, has been limited to organizational and business
development activities. We are real estate advisory and consulting company that assists real estate investor professionals, as well as
established companies, with advisory and consulting services focused on providing research, analysis and acquisition opportunities to
them. Our mission is to assist investors and professionals in the early stage analysis of market opportunities and the evaluation of
properties prior to them committing capital for the purchase or the leasing of real estate properties. We intend to focus our initial
marketing efforts in the commercial markets; however, we will also look at residential and income producing markets. We intend to use
the Internet as well as the services of independent sales consultants to market our services to investors and professionals in Southern
California with our initial efforts focused in Beverly Hills and Los Angeles. We have had limited operations and have limited financial
resources. Our auditors indicated in their report on our financial statements (the Report that the Company s
lack of business operations and early losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our operations
from March 2, 2015 (Date of Incorporation) to December 2019 were devoted primarily to development, operational activities, and acquisitions
which included: 

1. 
 Formation
 of the Company; 

2. 
 Development
 of our business plan; 

3. 
 Evaluating
 various target real estate professionals and investors to market our services; 

4. 
 Research
 on marketing channels/strategies for our services; 

5. 
 Secured
 our website domain www.hubilu.com and beginning the development of our initial online website; and 

6. 
 Research
 on services and the pricing of our services. 

Commencing
in June 2015, we engaged our first client, 112 South Eucalyptus Avenue, LLC, to assist it in evaluating the best use of its property. 

We
intend to provide services to target investors and professionals with the mission to assist them in investment and property evaluation
strategies and provide hands-on support to reduce evaluation time and resources and increase the speed for them to determine whether
to proceed with a real estate lease or investment. Besides general property evaluation services, we intend to offer services to assist
the principals with property development ideas and investment structure. 

Our
goal is to assist investors by providing them with the property opportunities, analysis and guidance to enhance their ability to purchase
or lease real estate. We are not real estate brokers and do not intend to offer brokerage services. We intend to initially target businesses
in Southern California.

As
of December 31, 2022, we had 92,068 cash on hand. Management does not believe this amount will satisfy our cash requirements for the
next twelve months. We plan to satisfy our future cash requirements - primarily the working capital required for operations by loans
from our shareholders or additional equity financing. The additional equity financing will likely be in the form of private placements
of common stock. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has borrowed 474,271 from Jacaranda Investments, Inc. 

Management
believes that if subsequent private placements are successful, we will generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof.
However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our
future cash requirements. 

If
we are unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering, we will then have to seek additional funds
through debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a new development stage company with nominal assets to secure. Therefore,
we are highly dependent upon the success of a future private placement offering and failure thereof would result in our having to seek
capital from other resources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to us. However, if such financing were available,
because we are a startup company with no operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high-risk loans
and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt
financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load. If we cannot raise additional
proceeds via a private placement of our common stock or secure debt financing, we would be required to cease business operations. As
a result, investors in our common stock would lose all of their investment. 

We
have no current plans, preliminary or otherwise, to merge with any other entity although we may consider such plans in the future. 

At
the present time, we intend to seek various investors to obtain additional equity financing. There can be no assurance that we will be
successful in obtaining additional capital from these negotiations. If are unable to raise additional capital, we will either suspend
marketing operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely. Other than as described in this paragraph and the preceding
paragraphs, we have no other financing plans. 

Management
does not plan to hire additional employees at this time. Our officers and directors, as well as independent contractors, will be responsible
for providing consulting services. 

Critical
Accounting Policy and Estimates. Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
section discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue
recognition, accrued expenses, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on
historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting estimates inherent
in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities
which are not readily apparent from other sources. In addition, these accounting policies are described at relevant sections in this
discussion and analysis and in the notes to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively together with notes thereto, which are included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. 

For
the Year Ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Revenues.
 Our rental revenues increased 386,900 to 1,579,682 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1,192,782 for the comparable
period in 2021 due to the acquisition of 4 new properties which were rehabbed and rented out. 

Operating
expenses. Operating expenses increased 273,197 to 798,559 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 525,362 for the comparable
period in 2021. Operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative expenses, consulting fees, depreciation, professional
fees, property taxes, rent, repairs and maintenance, transfer agent and filing fees and utilities. The components of operating expenses
are discussed below. 

General
and administrative expenses increased 182,239 to 589,948 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 407,709 for the comparable
period in 2021. 

24 

Depreciation
increased 90,958 to 208,611 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 117,653 for the comparable period in 2021. 

Professional
fees increased 61,521 to 61,916 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 395 for the comparable period in 2021. Professional
fees consisted of legal fees and accounting fees. 

Property
taxes increased 74,835 to 198,038 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 123,203 for the comparable period in 2021. The
increase is due to the acquisition of additional rental properties in 2023. 

Utilities
decreased 3,314 to 66,357 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 69,671 for the comparable period in 2021. 

Net
Loss. Our net loss increased by a net amount of 157,149, due to a loss of 114,286
for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net income of 42,863 for the comparable period in 2021. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources . Since 2015, Jacaranda Investments, Inc., provided us with 492,500 in related party advances. We have not
been advanced any more money since 2018. Jacaranda Investments, Inc. has agreed not to seek repayment of its advances until we are financially
able to repay them. In 2021, 18,229 was repaid to Jacaranda Investments, Inc. leaving the balance at 474,271. 

Our
total assets are 17,089,666 as of December 31, 2022, consisting of 11,800,304 in real estate, building and capital improvements of
 5,458,695, 296,463 in property acquisition and financing, net of 564,647 in depreciation, 92,068 in cash and 6,783 in security deposits. 

Our
total liabilities are 17,982,243 as of December 31, 2022 and 14,934,746 as of December 31, 2021. 

Our
total stockholders deficit is 892,577 for the year ended December 31, 2022, and as of December 31, 2022, our accumulated deficit
is 1,740,795. 

Our
net cash provided by operations was 241,335 for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Our
investing activities used a total of 559,903 for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

We
had 206,898 in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

We
do not now have funds sufficient for pursuing our plan of operation, but we are in the process of trying to increase rents to finance
our operations through rental cash flow. If operating difficulties or other factors (many of which are beyond our control) delay our
realization of revenues or cash flows from rental income, we may be limited in our ability to pursue our business plan. Moreover, if
unexpected expenses arise due to unanticipated pressures or if we decide to expand our business plan beyond its currently anticipated
level or otherwise, we will require additional financing to fund our operations, in addition to anticipated cash generated from our operations.
Additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds were not available or were not available
on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our business
or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. In a worst-case scenario, we might not be able to fund
our operations or to remain in business, which could result in a total loss of our stockholders investment. If we raise additional
funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced, and
these newly issued securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders.

Plan
of Operation 

We
were incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 2, 2015. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and
have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, we have not made any significant purchase or sale of
assets. We are a real estate consulting and acquisition company that has just begun to generate revenues through our real estate acquisitions.
If we are unable to successfully continue to find customers who will engage us to provide real estate consulting services or in acquiring
cash flow positive properties, we will be dependent on related party advances or the sale of securities for our working capital. 

Our
business strategy is to market our website www.hubilu.com whereby potential real estate users and investors will be able to
review our consulting services and engage us. We will develop our presence on various e-commerce sites focused on the real estate, consulting
and advisory industries as well as on mainstream sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. We are also focusing on expanding our
referral network by targeting other advisors such as lawyers, accountants, insurance agents, financial planners and other service professionals. 

The
number of companies which we will be able to provide services to will depend upon the success of our marketing efforts through our website
and our referral network. 

112
South Eucalyptus Avenue, LLC, our first client, retained us to assist it in maximizing its return on equity for its property, and to
source new properties for it to buy. We are evaluating various options for the client including a sale or a 1031 exchange. We are also
advising the client on the use of strategies utilizing an all-inclusive trust deed (AITD) whereby the seller of real estate, with equity
greater than its tax base, can spread the tax liability over the life of the loan underlying the AITD. This strategy also allows the
seller to have an ongoing income stream, which is the primary objective of selling a property using an AITD. We have conducted a preliminary
valuation of the property and have shown the opportunity to several potential investors. In the event we are unable to attract an interested
party to purchase the property, we will then introduce the seller to an experienced real estate broker who understands AITDs and how
to market the property to buyers. We are also in the process of seeking new properties for the client to buy, either as a stand-alone
purchase or as part of a 1031 exchange. 

Our
business is advising and consulting with real estate users and investors by providing consulting services to support to their leasing
or acquisition strategies. We intend to advise them on their capital formation, consulting with jurisdictional issues, property taxes,
zoning, corporate structure, administrative functions, such as bookkeeping, accounting, regulatory compliance and reporting, valuation
and other administrative tasks that real estate users and investors may not be familiar with or desire to operate internally. 

26 

We
intend to work collaboratively with real estate users and investors, as well as their existing advisors, to assist them in the proper
structure around proposed leases, development or acquisitions. We believe that by providing guidance and support to our potential clients
and assisting them in structuring their leases, developments or acquisitions we believe we will enable them to achieve increased returns.
We intend to partner and work with professional and technical advisors that have knowledge and expertise in real estate investors. To
the extent that our potential clients request our assistance in seeking capital or accessing the capital markets, we intend to introduce
them to the appropriate advisors who have the requisite expertise in the various areas that may require such expertise. 

Our
founder has access to strategic relationships with real estate investors, financial firms, investment bankers, brokers, individual and
institutional investors as well as accountants and attorneys. Our founder has invested his capital in the real estate markets and has
experience with real estate investing and management. We believe that a properly structured real estate transaction eases the ability
to attract the equity capital from investors thereby allowing the necessary capital to develop or acquire the properties. 

Our
business is focused on acquiring vacant residential income properties that we rehabilitate and rent at student housing market values
while simultaneously consulting and advising with real estate investors, professionals, and companies, We believe that this model of
student housing acquisitions and consulting with investors will generate positive cash flow in growing the company, which will increase
the evaluation of our stock, creating value for our investors and also obtaining client loyalty. The following are key elements of our
strategy: 

Acquisition process has a strategic methodology when acquiring and calculating cost in not only purchasing but in rehab and the value
in renting out to students near the USC campus and expanding LA Metro/subway stations. This allows favorable returns. 

We
may conduct limited research and development of additional services to offer. Further we do not expect significant changes in the number
of employees. Upon completion of our public offering, our specific goal is to offer consulting services to real estate users and investors.
Our plan of operations is as follows: 

Expand
and Enhance Our Website 

Time
Frame: 1 st to 3 rd months. 

Material
costs: 3,000 to 5,000. 

We
intend to further develop and enhance our website at www.hubilu.com . Our sole director and president, David Behrend, will oversee
the further development and expansion of our website and the consulting and advisory services we are offering to potential clients. We
hired a web designer to help us with the development and functionality of the website and intend to continue to enhance it. We do not
have any written agreements with any web designers at current time. The website expansion costs, including site design and implementation
will be approximately 3,000 to 5,000. Updating and improving our website will continue throughout the lifetime of our operations. 

Negotiate
agreements with potential referral sources and clients 

Time
Frame: 3 rd to 6 th . 

No
material costs. 

Now
that our website is operational, we have contacted and started negotiations with potential clients and referral sources. In June 2015,
we engaged our first client. We will negotiate terms and conditions of collaboration. At the beginning, we plan to focus primarily on
local advisors such as attorneys, accountants, insurance agents, title officers and financial planners. We do not expect to compensate
any referral sources and will offer reciprocal referrals to any source that is willing to refer us clients; however, we may decide to
compensate referral sources on a case-by-case basis. Then we plan to expand our target market to other service providers and investment
professionals such as investment bankers. This activity will be ongoing throughout our operations. Even though the negotiation with potential
customers and referral sources will be ongoing during the life of our operations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to find successful
agreements, in which case our business may fail, and we will have to cease our operations. We do not expect to enter into formal written
agreements with our referral sources and intend for these agreements to be oral. We intend to enter into real estate consulting agreements
with our clients that will set forth the scope of services we agree to with these clients and provide for the hourly or flat rate billing
arrangements. 

27 

In
the future, when/if we have available resources, operating history and experience, we plan to contact larger referrals sources that have
more established clients. However, we anticipate encountering many market barriers in becoming a service provider to clients of large
established professionals. Our competitors have gained customer loyalty and brand identification through their long-standing advertising
and customer service efforts. This creates a barrier to market entry by forcing us to spend time and money to differentiate our product
in the marketplace and overcome these loyalties. The large established service providers may require capital investments in personnel.
Considering our lack of operating history and experience in being a real estate consulting firm, we may never become a consultant to
large established clients. 

Ongoing
Marketing Campaign 

Time
Frame: 6 th - 12 th months. 

Material
costs: 10,000. 

We
intend to use marketing strategies, such as social media, networking and organic marketing to acquire potential customers and potential
investors. We believe that we should begin to see results from our marketing campaign within 120 days from its initiation. We also will
use Internet promotion tools on real estate and consulting websites, as well as on Facebook and Twitter, to advertise our services. We
intend to spend 10,000 on marketing efforts during the next year. We intend our marketing efforts to be an ongoing activity that will
continue during the life of our operations. 

Even
if we can obtain sufficient number of consulting agreements, or purchase enough assets at the end of the twelve-month period, there is
no guarantee that we will be able to attract, and more importantly retain, enough customers to justify our expenditures. If we are unable
to generate a significant amount of revenue and to successfully protect ourselves against those risks, then it would materially affect
our financial condition and our business could be harmed. 

Independent
Contractors 

Time
Frame: 6 th -12 th months. 

Material
costs: 50,000. 

We
believe our officers have good knowledge and broad connections in the real estate consulting industry to introduce our services, including
find new potential clients, set up agreements with customers and referral sources to engage our consulting services. We currently anticipate
that the negotiation of additional agreements with potential customers will be ongoing during the life of our operations. 

We
believe our website is state-of-the-art and we developed it to use as part of our sales efforts. During the next 12 months, we will implement
our marketing campaign to assist officers in sales and marketing. There is no assurance that we will generate any revenue in the next
12 months or ever generate any future revenue. 

David Behrend, our president, is devoting approximately twenty-five hours
per week to our operations. Once we expand our operations and attract more customers to use our services and acquire more assets, Mr Behrend
has agreed to commit more time as required. 

Estimated
Expenses for the Next Twelve Months 

The
following provides an overview of our estimated expenses to fund our plan of operation for the next twelve months. These expenses, which
we estimate to be as follows: 

Description 
 Expenses 

SEC reporting and compliance 
 5,000 
 
 Website expansion 
 1,000 
 
 Marketing and advertising 
 10,000 
 
 Advances to independent contractors 
 50,000 
 
 Salaries 
 70,000 
 
 Legal and accounting 
 65,000 

201,000 

28 

We
anticipate that the minimum additional capital necessary to fund our planned operations in this case for the 12-month period will be
approximately 201,000 and will be needed for general administrative expenses, business development, marketing costs and costs associated
with being a publicly reporting company. Thus, we will need to seek additional funding in the future. The most likely source of this
additional capital is through the sale of additional shares of common or preferred stock or loans obtained by the company. 

If
we can successfully complete the above goals within the estimated timeframes set forth and can raise proceeds additional proceeds that
may be needed to secure additional personnel and marketing funds, those funds would be allocated as follows: 

Our
management may hire full or part- time employees or independent contractors over the next six (6) months; however, at the present, the
services provided by our officers and director appears sufficient now. We believe that our operations are currently on a small scale
that is manageable by these two individuals and can be supplemented by engaging independent contractors. Our management s responsibilities
are mainly administrative at this early stage. While we believe that the addition of employees is not required over the next six (6)
months, the professionals we plan to utilize may be independent contractors. We do not intend to enter any employment agreements with
any of these professionals. Thus, these persons are not intended to be employees of our company. 

Our
management does not expect to incur any material research costs in the next twelve months; we currently do not own any plants or equipment
that we would seek to sell soon; we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements; and we have not paid for expenses on behalf of our
officer or directors. Additionally, we believe that this fact shall not materially change. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

None. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncement 

In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, established Topic 842, Leases, by issuing Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-02, which requires lessors to classify leases as a sales-type, direct financing, or operating lease and
requires lessees to recognize leases on-balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 was subsequently
amended by ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842; ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements
to Topic 842, Leases; and ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019 and
elected the effective date method for the transition. The Company elected the following practical expedients: 

Transition
 method practical expedient permits the Company to use the effective date as the date of initial application. Upon adoption,
 the Company did not have a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. Financial information and disclosures
 for periods before January 1, 2019 were not updated. 

Short-term
 lease practical expedient permits the Company not to recognize leases with a term equal to or less than 12 months. 

Lessor
Accounting 

The
accounting for lessors under the new standard remained relatively unchanged with a few targeted updates impacting the Company, which
included: (i) narrower definition of initial direct costs that requires certain costs to be expensed rather than capitalized, and (ii)
provisions for uncollectible rents to be recorded as a reduction in revenue rather than as bad debt expense. 

Lessee
Accounting 

The
new standard requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer
than 12 months. Leases are classified as finance or operating at inception, with classification affecting the pattern and recording of
expenses in the statement of operations. There was no impact on the Company s financial statements on the adoption of Topic 842
given that its office lease does not exceed 12 months in duration.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders
of Hubilu Venture Corporation 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hubilu Venture Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year
period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion,
the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December
31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31,
2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company suffered a net loss from operations and has a net capital deficiency, which raises substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 2.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements
that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which
they relate. 

As
discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company had a going concern due to a continual net loss, stockholders deficiency
and cash used in operations. 

Auditing
management s evaluation of a going concern can be a significant judgment given the fact that the Company uses management estimates
on future revenues and expenses which are not able to be substantiated. 

To
evaluate the appropriateness of the going concern, we examined and evaluate the financial information that was the initial cause along
with management s plans to mitigate the going concern and management s disclosure on going concern.

HUBILU
VENTURE CORPORATION 

 Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

on and is a publicly
traded real estate consulting, asset management and business acquisition company, which specializes in acquiring student housing income
properties and development/business opportunities located near within the Los Angeles area. 

since inception and expects to incur further losses
in the development of its business, all of which casts substantial doubt upon the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
and, therefore, that it may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses
until it becomes profitable. Management intends to focus on raising additional funds either by way of debt or equity issuances in order
to continue operations. The Company cannot provide any assurance or guarantee that it will be able to obtain additional financing or
generate revenues sufficient to maintain operations. 

years to a maximum of years on buildings and major improvements. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve
or extend the useful lives of the related assets are charged to operations as incurred. Tenant improvements are capitalized and depreciated
over the life of the related lease or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. 

The
Company s methodology of allocating the cost of acquisitions to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on estimated fair
values, replacement cost and/or appraised values. When the Company acquires operating real estate properties, the purchase price is allocated
to land, building, improvements, leasing costs, intangibles such as in-place leases, assumed debt, if any, and to current assets and
liabilities acquired, if any. The value allocated to in-place leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental
income in the consolidated statements of operations. 

When
the Company acquires a property, it allocates the aggregate purchase price to tangible assets, consisting of land, building, site improvements
and furniture, fixtures and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets component at the time of purchase. The Company follows the
guidance as outlined in ASC 805-10, Business Combinations, as amended by ASU 2017-01. Most property acquisitions made by the Company
will fall within the category of acquired assets rather than acquired businesses. This distinction will cause the Company to capitalize
its costs for acquisitions, allocate them to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities and amortize these costs over the remaining
useful lives of those assets and liabilities. Should the Company complete any acquisitions in the future which qualify as acquisitions
of businesses, associated acquisition costs would be expensed as incurred.

its accounting for the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act. This includes a provisional amount related to the re-measurement of deferred
tax assets based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally plus the applicable state tax
rate, with a corresponding change to the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017. The impact of the 2017 Tax Act may differ from

nor has M K CPAs PLLC provided to our company a written report or oral advice that M K CPAs PLLC concluded was an important factor
considered by our company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue, other than in connection
with carrying out the review procedures required under Appendix K of SEC Practice Section rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB). In addition, during such periods, our company has not consulted with M K CPAs PLLC regarding any matter
that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) and the related instructions) or a reportable event (as
described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures. 

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed with an objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed with an objective
of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, in order
to allow timely consideration regarding required disclosures. 

The
evaluation of our disclosure controls by our principal executive officer included a review of the controls objectives and design,
the operation of the controls, and the effect of the controls on the information presented in this Annual Report. Our management, including
our chief executive officer, does not expect that disclosure controls can or will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud, if any.
A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Also, projections of any evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures to future periods are subject
to the risk that the disclosure controls and procedures may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by
this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022 were not effective in timely alerting them to material information which is required
to be included in our periodic reports filed with the SEC as of the end of the period covering this report and to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 

(b)
Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company in accordance
with as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the (i) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (ii) reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and (iii)
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Our internal controls framework is based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control
- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management s
assessment of the effectiveness of the small business issuer s internal control over financial reporting is as of the year ended
December 31, 2022. We believe that internal control over financial reporting is not effective. We have identified current material weaknesses
considering the nature and extent of our current operations and any risks or errors in financial reporting under current operations. 

Material
weaknesses identified: 

The
 Company does not have adequate segregation of duties in the handling of their financial reporting. This is caused by a very limited
 number of personnel. 

Our
 company s accounting staff does not have sufficient technical accounting knowledge relating to accounting for income taxes
 and complex US GAAP matters. 

31 

Plan
for Remediation of Material Weaknesses 

We
intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make the necessary improvements to remediate this deficiency as resources to do so
become available. We intend to consider the results of our remediation efforts and related testing as part of our year-end 2022 assessment
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 

Such
remediation would entail enhancing the training and oversight of the accounting personnel responsible for non-routine transactions involving
complex accounting matters and engaging the services of an independent consultant with sufficient expertise in income tax and complex
US GAAP matters to assist us in the preparation of our financial statements. 

(c)
Changes in internal controls. 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December
31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Possible
Potential Conflicts 

The
OTC Pink on which we have our shares of common stock quoted on does not currently have any director independence requirements. 

No
member of management will be required by us to work on a full-time basis. Accordingly, certain conflicts of interest may arise between
us and our officer and director in that he may have other business interests in the future to which he devotes his attention, and he
may be expected to continue to do so although management time must also be devoted to our business. Thus, conflicts of interest may arise
that can be resolved only through his exercise of such judgment as is consistent with each officer s understanding of his fiduciary
duties to us. During other business activities, they may become aware of business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation
to us, as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. As such, there may be conflicts of interest in determining to which
entity a business opportunity should be presented 

To
resolve such potential conflicts of interest, our officers and sole director have orally agreed that any opportunities that they are
aware of independently or directly through their association with us (as opposed to disclosure to them of such business opportunities
by management or consultants associated with other entities) would be presented by them solely to us. 

We
cannot provide assurances that our efforts to eliminate the potential impact of conflicts of interest will be effective. 

Currently
we have one officer and one director and will seek to add additional officer(s) and/or director(s) as and when the proper personnel are
located and terms of employment are mutually negotiated and agreed, and we have sufficient capital resources and cash flow to make such
offers. 

33 

We
cannot provide assurances that our efforts to eliminate the potential impact of conflicts of interest will be effective. 

Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics 

In
March 31, 2015, we adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct which is applicable to our future employees and which also includes
a Code of Ethics for our chief executive and principal financial officers and any persons performing similar functions. A code of ethics
is a written standard designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote: 

honest
 and ethical conduct, 

full,
 fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in regulatory filings and public statements, 

compliance
 with applicable laws, rules and regulations, 

the
 prompt reporting violation of the code, and 

accountability
 for adherence to the code. 

A
copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 14.1 to our registration
statement of which this prospectus is a part. 

Board
of Directors 

Our
sole director holds office until the completion of his term of office, which is not longer than one year, or until his successor(s) have
been elected. Our sole director s term of office expires on March 31, 2027. All officers are appointed annually by the board of
directors and, subject to existing employment agreements (of which there are currently none), serve at the discretion of the board. Currently,
directors receive no compensation for their role as directors but may receive compensation for their role as officers. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

During
the past five years, other than as set forth below, no present director, executive officer or person nominated to become a director or
an executive officer of us: 

(1)
had a petition under the federal bankruptcy laws or any state insolvency law filed by or against, or a receiver, fiscal agent or similar
officer appointed by a court for the business or property of such person, or any partnership in which he was a general partner at or
within two years before the time of such filing, or any corporation or business association of which he was an executive officer at or
within two years before the time of such filing; 

(2)
was convicted in a criminal proceeding or subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); 

(3)
was subject to any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction,
permanently or temporarily enjoining him from or otherwise limiting his involvement in any of the following activities: 

i.
acting as a futures commission merchant, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor commodity pool operator, floor broker, leverage
transaction merchant, any other person regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or an associated person of any of the foregoing,
or as an investment adviser, underwriter, broker or dealer in securities, or as an affiliated person, director or employee of any investment
company, bank, savings and loan association or insurance company, or engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection
with such activity; 

34 

ii.
engaging in any type of business practice; or 

iii.
engaging in any activity in connection with the purchase or sale of any security or commodity or in connection with any violation of
federal or state securities laws or federal commodities laws; or 

(4)
was the subject of any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of an federal or state authority barring,
suspending or otherwise limiting for more than 60 days the right of such person to engage in any activity described in paragraph (3)
(i), above, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity; or 

(5)
was found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and for which the judgment has not been reversed, suspended
or vacated. 

In
March 2010, Mr. Behrend filed a petition for bankruptcy with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Case No.
2:10-bk-21201-VK. In April 2011, the Case was converted to a Chapter 7 petition, Case No. 01:11-bk-11379-VK and in October 2012, Mr.
Behrend received a discharge. 

In
June 2009, the Los Angeles City Attorney brought charges against Mr. Behrend, who was the majority member of a limited liability company
that acted as a trustee for a trust, which controlled and managed a residential apartment building in Los Angeles. Mr. Behrend pled no
contest to a misdemeanor charge of violating the habitability of an apartment building and received a fine, 300 hours of community service,
90 days electronic monitoring and 8 years probation. Mr. Behrend has completed all the conditions of his sentence. His probation
expired in June 2017. 

Committees
of the Board of Directors 

Concurrent
with having sufficient members and resources, our board of directors will establish an audit committee and a compensation committee.
We believe that we will need a minimum of five directors to have effective committee systems. The audit committee will review the results
and scope of the audit and other services provided by the independent auditors and review and evaluate the system of internal controls.
The compensation committee will manage any stock option plan we may establish and review and recommend compensation arrangements for
the officers. No final determination has yet been made as to the memberships of these committees or when we will have sufficient members
to establish committees. See Executive Compensation hereinafter. 

We
will reimburse all directors for any expenses incurred in attending directors meetings if we have the resources to pay these fees.
We will consider applying for officers and directors liability insurance at such time when we have the resources to do
so.

key employees, individually and as a group, and the present owners of 5 or more of our total outstanding shares. The shareholders listed

(1) 
 David
 Behrend, the sole shareholder of Jacaranda3 Investments, Inc., has dispositive control over the shares. Since he will continue to
 control us, investors in our common or preferred offering will be unable to change the course of our operations. Thus, our shares
 lack the value normally attributable to voting rights. This could result in a reduction in value of the shares you own because of
 their ineffective voting power. 

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 

Our
promoters are Mr. Behrend, our chairman, president, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and Mrs. Black- Van Wier is our
secretary. 

Our
office and mailing address is 205 South Beverly Drive, Suite 205, Beverly Hills, CA 90212. On March 4, 2016, we entered into a
written lease for 750 square feet of space for 2,200 per month at this location. Our lease is month-to month going forward.
As of January 1, 2020, our space rent was 2,450. Our current lease, which changed on June 1, 2020, is now 375 square feet of space
on a month to month basis and is 1,300 per month. We have an excellent relationship with our landlord and do not expect to move in
the near future. Jacaranda Investments, Inc., advanced us the first month s prorated rent of 1,703 and 6,600 for the
landlord s security deposit. From April 1, 2015 to February 29, 2016, one of our minority shareholders provided us with office
space at no cost to us and therefore we did not incur any rent expense. We estimate that the approximate value of the space he was
providing to be 300 per month and there was no written lease agreement for our use of this space, which he provided to us on a
month-to-month basis. 

On
March 5, 2015, we sold 25,000,000 shares of our common stock to David Behrend, our president, chief executive officer, chief financial
officer, and sole director. These shares were issued in for 75,000 in cash or 0.003 per share. On April 30, 2015, David Behrend transferred
all his shares to Jacaranda Investments, Inc., Jacaranda a corporation previously owned by him in exchange for shares in
that corporation. Jacaranda has advanced us 485,000 for working capital. 

Our
officers and sole director are required to commit time to our affairs and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating
management time among various business activities. During other business activities, they may become aware of business opportunities
that may be appropriate for presentation to us, as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. As such, there may be conflicts
of interest in determining to which entity a business opportunity should be presented. 

37 

To
resolve such potential conflicts of interest, our officers and sole director have agreed that any opportunities that they are aware of
independently or directly through their association with us (as opposed to disclosure to them of such business opportunities by management
or consultants associated with other entities) would be presented by them solely to us. 

We
cannot provide assurances that our efforts to eliminate the potential impact of conflicts of interest will be effective. 

We
believe that each reported transaction and relationship is on terms that are at least as fair to us as would be expected if those transactions
were negotiated with third parties. 

There
have been no other related party transactions, or any other transactions or relationships required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404
of Regulation S-K. 

Regarding
any future related party transaction, we plan to fully disclose all related party transactions, including, but not limited to, the following: 

disclose
 such transactions in prospectuses where required; 

disclose
 in all filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, where required; 

obtain
 disinterested directors consent; and 

obtain
 shareholder consent where required. 

Item
14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services. 

The
following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed or expected to be billed to our company for professional services rendered by our
independent registered public accounting firms, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

of the Company s annual consolidated financial statements filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Audit
Fees . Consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audits of our financial statements, reviews of our interim
financial statements included in quarterly reports, services performed in connection with regular filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and other services that are normally provided for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 in connection with statutory
and regulatory filings or engagements. 

Policy
on Pre-Approval by Audit Committee of Services Performed by Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Our
board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. All of the above services
and fees were reviewed and approved by our board of directors before the respective services were rendered. 

Our
Director has considered the nature and amount of fees billed or expected to be billed by DMCL and believes that the provision of services
for activities unrelated to the audit was compatible with maintaining DMCL s independence.
