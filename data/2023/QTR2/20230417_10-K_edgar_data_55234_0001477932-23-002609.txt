We expressly disclaim any obligations on undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or to reflect any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such forward-looking statement is based in whole or in part. Readers should amongst the other statements contained herein and future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to be filed, carefully review in Item 7 the following: Cautionary Statements for Purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Risk Factors . All the Risk Factors contained therein should be carefully read. 3 Table of Contents ITEM 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS PART 1 THE COMPANY Kenilworth Systems Corporation hereinafter referred to as Kenilworth , the Company or we , was incorporated on April 25, 1968 under the laws of the State of New York. Kenilworth has been a publicly traded Company since August 1968 formerly on the National NASDAQ Market, presently on the OTC Pink Sheet Market since emerging from Bankruptcy Proceedings in September 1998. Kenilworth is not a Development Stage Company. GENERAL The Company objective is to identify firms seeking data that employ omni-channel marketing that can utilize our data to drive product offerings. This target market includes advertising technology companies, enterprise solution platforms, or brands seeking to market goods and services to consumers using cutting-edge technology, multi-channel micro advertising. The data allows proprietary platforms programmatic and end-to-end omni-channel marketing capabilities using the consumer data sets. Prior to this we had been engaged in developing patents, markets and investigating how best to obtain Governmental approvals, by engaging lobbyists and consultants that would allow Internet, television, satellite, cable subscribers. Kenilworth Systems was a leader in developing state of the art software for corporate licensing relating to technological design fields. Kenilworth s revenues were to be generated from licenses and patents an interest in a joint-venture operation to develop on- line secure tools for its clients and vendors of clients. On September 28, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of certain intellectual property and database assets of ACL Group, Inc.. The compensation paid by the Registrant for these assets is as follows: (a) A Secured Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of 300,000,000, bearing an interest rate of 5 per annum, and convertible into Shares of Common Stock of the Registrant in accordance with the terms of the Note, a copy of which is annexed hereto as an Exhibit; (b) 40,000,000 shares of the Registrant s authorized but unissued 0.001 par value common stock; (c) 1,000,000 shares of the Registrant s authorized but unissued Series A Preferred Stock, and 1,000 shares of the Registrants authorized but unissued Series B Preferred Stock, which shall bear the rights, privileges and preferences as set forth in the Certificate of Designation annexed hereto as an Exhibit; (d) 20,000,000 Class A Common Stock Purchase Warrants, exercisable at .02 per Share and expiring 10 years from the date of issuance. ASSET SALE TO ACL GROUP, INC. On March 17, 2022, pursuant to an Agreement for Purchase and Sale of Assets, the Registrant completed the sale of its principal assets to ACL Group, Inc. These assets had originally been acquired from ACL Group, Inc. on September 23, 2021 in exchange for the issuance by the Registrant of a Secured Promissory Note in the amount of 300,000,000 to ACL Group, Inc. During the six-month period agreed upon by the Parties, the management of the Registrant determined that the cash-flow which would be obtained from the commercialization of these assets would be insufficient to meet the debt service obligations. Accordingly, the Parties agreed to the re-acquisition of the assets by ACL Group, Inc., and the Secured Promissory Note issued by the Registrant, dated September 23, 2021, in the principal amount of 300,000,000 plus accrued and unpaid interest was satisfied and extinguished. On March 28, 2022, the Registrant entered into a License Agreement with ACL Group, Inc. ACL which granted to the Registrant a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable right to use certain Service and Documentation Assets of ACL, which Intellectual Property is more particularly described in the License Agreement which is attached as an Exhibit hereto. The License includes up to an estimated 240,000,000 data records, up to 300 data field points, consisting of an estimated 700,000,000 categorized records. The Annual Charge for the License is computed for access to all of the categorized records automatically recurring as a perpetual license fee of 500,000.00 paid per terms of invoice as well as 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Registrant which are non-dilutive nonrefundable common shares. Additional fees due to ACL for implementation of the License and Information Services provided by ACL s support team amount to 137,250. 4 Table of Contents SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On February 2, 2023, the foregoing Asset Sale was reversed, and all of the Shares and Warrants which had been issued to ACL Group, Inc. were acquired by the current President of the Company, Dan W. Snyder, for 25,000 in consideration paid. EMPLOYEES Kenilworth, at present, has no employees BACKLOG We do not have any backlog.

(A) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Since we exited from bankruptcy proceedings on September 28, 1998, we have had no revenues from operations, and therefore sustained losses from operating expenses amounting to 10,110.00 in 2020, 45.00 in 2021, and 13,558 in 2022. Kenilworth has had no revenues from operations since exiting from Bankruptcy Proceedings in September 1998. 8 Table of Contents (B) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Presently Kenilworth Systems Corporation has an objective to identify firms seeking data to drive their omni -channel marketing programs. Whether advertising technology companies, enterprise solution platforms, or brands seeking to market goods and services to consumers using cutting-edge technology, multi-channel micro advertising. The data allows proprietary platforms programmatic, or end-to-end omni-channel marketing capabilities using the consumer data sets. Kenilworth Systems Corporation was formerly a leader in developing state of the art software for corporate licensing relating to technological design fields. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND RISK FACTORS The information contained in this Form 10-K and Kenilworth s other filings with the Securities Exchange Commission contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is subject to the safe harbors created thereby. Such information involves important risks and uncertainties. Forward-Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. Certain information included in this Annual Report on this Form 10-K contains statements that are forward-looking, including, but not limited to, statements relating to our business strategy and development activities as well as other capital spending, financing sources, the effects of regulation (including gaming and tax regulations), expectations concerning future operations, margins, profitability and competition. Any statements contained in this Form 10-K that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward- looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, would, could, believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, plan, continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Such forward-looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and, accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, our lack of recent operating history, existing management, general domestic or international economic conditions, pending or future legal proceedings, changes in federal or state tax laws or the administration of such laws, changes in gaming laws or regulations (including the legalization of gaming in certain jurisdictions), applications for licenses and approvals under applicable jurisdictional laws and regulations (including gaming laws and regulations). You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based only on information currently available to us. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this 10-K report for the year ended December 31, 2021, and subsequent events reported in this FORM 10-K. Risk Uncertainties Due to the global pandemic of COVID-19, Kenilworth Systems Corporation, in the midst of reorganizing, was stymied in its redevelopment and continuation. Many agencies were closed and not available for assistance during this unprecedented period. These agencies were paramount in the development, continuity, and chronological growth of the corporation. Risk and uncertainties certainly derive from the above statement however, Kenilworth Systems Corporation is determined and will strive and continue to make every effort to move forward in its reorganization and development. Going Concern In an effort to have Kenilworth Systems Corporation reorganize and restructure its business model the company has begun looking into ways to monetize their proprietary data access, to seek accretive business combinations, and to identify Nasdaq-qualified merger candidates that are privately held seeking a public listing of their shares. We have no way to predict the future of this company; however, currently the corporation shows indications of growth moving into 2023. 9 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS NO OPERATING HISTORY We have had no new revenues from operations since 1991. We exited from bankruptcy proceedings in 1998 without assets and liabilities. We have had no revenues from operations since then and we may never have any revenues from operations in the future, which may result in the termination of our business. WE HAVE NO WORKING CAPITAL As of December 31, 2022, the working capital of Kenilworth was negative current liability of 300,000,000 represented by the Promissory Note incurred in the intellectual property acquisition. We have also been able to obtain working capital from investors that purchase Convertible Promissory Notes, Stock Purchase and Options Agreements and by issuing restricted Common Shares for services rendered. OUR BUSINESS IS ONLY IN THE PLANNING STAGE As of December 31 t , 2021, Kenilworth Systems Corporation is looking forward to modifying its current structure into a Corporate Holding Company. The process for this continuation is currently under discussions and once completed, in the next couple of months, once initiated, will be available for use in holding data assets, such as intellectual patents and other proprietary property from around the world. RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY Technology in general is subject to rapid change. Kenilworth will need to maintain an ongoing research and development effort of which there can be no assurances of success or availability of funds. WE ARE ENGAGED IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY Our business is subject to significant competition. Competition exists from larger companies that possess substantially greater technical, financial, sales and marketing resources that Kenilworth presently possesses. Such competition is expected to increase. Such increased competition may have a material adverse effect on Kenilworth s ability to successfully market its products. OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONTROL OVER US AND MAY APPROVE OR REJECT MATTERS CONTRARY TO A VOTE OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS Our executive officers and directors together with their affiliates beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders, if acting together, will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or similar transactions even if the stockholders disagree. SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO FALL If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock would most likely fall. WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS We are not able to pay any dividends because we have no funds available to do so. Even if we had funds available, we do not intend or declare to pay any dividends on our common stock in the near future. 10 Table of Contents ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The financial statements, the accompanying notes are filed as part of this Report annexed at the end of this report.

SNYDER 17 Table of Contents INDEX TO AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS KENILWORTH SYSTEMS CORPORATION TABLE OF CONTENTS Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID F-2 Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 F-3 Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 F-4 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 F-5 Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 F-6 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements F-7 F-1 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the shareholders and the board of directors of Kenilworth Systems Corporation. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Kenilworth Systems Corporation. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022, and 2021 and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes collectively referred to as the "financial statements . In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern as disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statement, the Company has continuously incurred a net loss of (13,358) for the year ended December 31, 2022, and an accumulated deficit of (39,279,950) at December 31, 2022. The continuation of the Company as a going concern through December 31, 2022, is dependent upon improving the profitability and the continuing financial support from its stockholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide additional cash to meet the Company s obligations as they become due. These factors raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty. Correction of preferred shares We draw your attention to note 7 to the financial statements on the correction of the overstatement of the par value of the series A preferred shares in the year 2021 and the correction of the unissued Series B and C preferred shares wrongly reported as issued in the year 2021; comparative financial statement. The errors have been corrected and the balances restated appropriately in this financial statement. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. Communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. As of December 31, 2022, there are no critical audit matters to be communicated. (Chartered Accountants) We have served as the Company's auditor since July 2022. April 14th, 2023.

The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company generating cash from the sale of its common stock and/or obtaining debt financing and attaining future profitable operations.
