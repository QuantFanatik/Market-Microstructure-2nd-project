BUSINESS History and Organization The Company is a minerals investment, management, and exploration company, and currently conducting test mining and pilot milling operations through an operating subsidiary in M xico, with specific focus on precious and base metals in M xico. The Company was originally incorporated in the State of California on September 28, 1937, under the name West Coast Mines, Inc. In November 1998, the Company re-domiciled from California to Delaware and changed its name to DynaResource, Inc. DynaUSA ). DynaUSA currently owns 80 of the outstanding shares of DynaM xico, 79 owned directly and 1 hold by the current CEO on behalf of the Company compliance with Mexican law and DynaM xico currently holds 20 of the shares of DynaM xico as treasury shares after complete foreclosure and recovery of those share on February 20, 2020 from goldgroup Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Goldgroup Mining Inc. Vancouver, BC Goldgroup ). DynaM xico owns 100 of the mining concessions, equipment, camp and related facilities which comprise the San Jose de Grac a Property SJG ), in northern Sinaloa State, M xico. We also own 100 of Mineras de DynaResource S.A. de C.V. DynaMineras ). The Company also has another wholly owned subsidiary, DynaResource Operaciones, S.A. de C.V. DynaOperaciones ). The Company currently conducts test mining and pilot milling operations, and other exploration activities in M xico. Segment Information Our only current operating segment is gold mining and milling operation. Products The end use product produced at our test mining and pilot milling operations at SJG is in the form of gold-silver concentrates. Gold-silver concentrates, or simply concentrate, is raw precious metals materials that has been crushed and ground finely to a sand-like product where gangue (waste) and non-precious metals are removed or reduced, thus concentrating the precious metals component. Concentrates processed and produced from San Jose de Grac a are shipped to third-party smelters, refineries or third parties for further processing or re-sale. During 2022, we reported the delivery and sale of 25,554 (subject to final settlements) net Oz gold-silver contained in concentrates. All gold-silver concentrate originated from the San Jose de Grac a Property in M xico. Gold-silver concentrates are sold at a small discount to the prevailing spot market price, based on the price per ounce of gold and silver quoted at the London PM fix, with the actual net precious metals prices received depending on the sales contract. Concentrates are priced by individual concentrate lots of 36 to 72 tons, or as a series of lots under contract, whereby the final selling price and gold-silver quantities are subject to final adjustments at the time of final purchase settlement. Gold and Silver Pilot Processing Methods Gold and silver are extracted from mined mineralized material, by crushing, grinding, milling, and further by simple gravity and flotation recoveries. The mineralized material is extracted by underground mining methods. The processing plant at the San Jos de Grac a mine is composed of conventional crushing and grinding circuits, and with gravity and flotation recovery methods. The gravity and flotation concentrates are dewatered and shipped to purchasers in semi-truck trailers. Exploration Stage The Company is an exploration stage issuer as defined in Section 1300 of Regulation S-K. General Government Regulations M xico In Mexico, we are subject to various governmental laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing facilities and concessions granted under contracts with the host government, there are no third-party patents, licenses or franchises material to our business. The applicable laws and regulations applicable to us include but are not limited to: Mineral Concession Rights. Exploration and exploitation of minerals in M xico may be carried out through Mexican companies incorporated under Mexican law by means of obtaining mining concessions. Mining concessions are granted by the Mexican government for a period of fifty years from the date of their recording in the Public Registry of Mining and are renewable for a further period of fifty years upon application within five years prior to the expiration of such concession in accordance with the Mining Law and its regulations. Mining concessions are subject to annual work requirements and payment of annual surface taxes which are assessed and levied on a semi-annual basis. Such concessions may be transferred or assigned by their holders, but such transfers or assignments must be registered with the Public Registry of Mining in order to be valid against third parties. The holder of a concession must pay semi-annual duties in January and July of each year on a per hectare basis and in accordance with the amounts provided by the Federal Fees Law. During the month of May of each year, the concessionaire must file with the General Bureau of Mines, the work assessment reports made on each concession or group of concessions for the preceding calendar year. The regulations of the Mining Law provide tables containing the minimum investment amounts that must be made on a concession. This amount is updated annually in accordance with the changes in the Consumer Price Index. Surface Rights. In M xico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, Ejidos (communal owners of land recognized by the federal laws in M xico) control surface access rights to the land. An Ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While the Company has agreements or is in the process of negotiating agreements with the Ejido that impact all of its projects in M xico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiation. Environmental Law. The Environmental Law in M xico, called the "General Law of Ecological Balance and Protection to the Environment" ("General Law"), provides for general environmental policies, with specific requirements for certain activities such as exploration set forth in regulations called "Mexican official norms". Responsibility for enforcement of the General Law, the regulations and the Mexican official norms is with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, which regulate all environmental matters with the assistance of Procuraduria Federal de Protecci n al Ambiente (known as "PROFEPA"). 2020 Forestry Law. The 2020 Forestry Law provides for general policies for the use and protection of the surface, and for plants, soil and trees. The regulation of the Forestry Law is with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, with the assistance of PROFEPA. Residues Law. The Residues Law, also known as Norm 141, provides for general policies for the deposit and storage of residue and waste. The regulation of the Residues Law is with the Ministry Of Environment and Natural Resources, with the assistance of PROFEPA. The primary laws and regulations used by the State of Sinaloa, where our San Jose de Grac a property is located, in order to govern environmental protection for mining and exploration are: The General Law, the 2020 Forestry Law, Residues Law, as well as their specific regulations on air, water and residues, and the Mexican official norms (known as "NOM-120"). In order to comply with the environmental regulations, a concessionaire must obtain a series of permits during the exploitation and exploration stage. The time required to obtain the required permits is dependent on a few factors including the type of vegetation and trees impacted by proposed activities. Mining Permits. The Secretariat of Environmental and Natural Resources, the Mexican Government environmental authority ("SEMARNAT"), is responsible for issuing environmental permits associated with mining. Three main permits required before construction can begin are: Environmental Impact Statement (known in M xico as Manifesto Impacto Ambiental ("MIA"), Land Use Change (known in M xico as Estudio Justificativo Para Cambio Uso Sueldo ("ETJ"), and Risk Analysis (known in M xico as Analisis de Riesgo ("RA"). A construction permit is required from the local municipality and an archaeological release letter must be obtained from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (known as "INAH"). An explosives permit is required from the ministry of defense before construction can begin. The Environmental Impact Statement is required to be prepared by a third-party contractor and submitted to SEMARNAT and must include a detailed analysis of climate, air quality, water, soil, vegetation, wildlife, cultural resources and socio-economic impacts. The Risk Analysis study (which is included into the Environmental Impact Statement and submitted as one complete document) identifies potential environmental releases of hazardous substances and evaluates the risks in order to establish methods to prevent, respond to, and control environmental emergencies. The Land Use Change requires that an evaluation be made of the existing conditions of the land, including a plant and wildlife study, an evaluation of the current and proposed use of the land, impacts to naturally occurring resources, and an evaluation of reclamation/re-vegetation plans. 4 Table of Contents We believe that all of our properties are operated in compliance with all applicable governmental laws and regulations and the costs of compliance are paid for on an ongoing basis. Costs of compliance - due to the nature of our permit, we have requirements for landscape restoration which are fulfilled on an ongoing basis. We do not have an asset retirement obligation. We are working under a permit which required a Bond of approximately 120,000 pesos which was requested as a Forest Fund bond and does not require, other than the replanting of material, any reclamation work since we are mining underground. Customers The Company sells its concentrates to the buyer who offers the best terms based upon price, treatment costs, refining costs, and other terms of payment. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold gold-silver concentrates to one purchaser pursuant to a Revolving Credit Line Facility and Commercial Offtake Agreement (the RCL ). As a result of the RCL, the Company s financial well-being is heavily dependent on a single purchaser. Distribution Methods As gold and silver can be sold through numerous gold and silver market traders worldwide, the Company is not economically dependent on a limited number of customers for the sale of its product. In 2022, we sold to one buyer that gave us the best overall terms. Products and Raw Materials We have no new products. Gold concentrates is the only product we produce. Additionally, we have no major suppliers of raw materials as the ore we mine is the most important raw material we use. Supplementary supplies such as fuel and chemicals are in ready supply from a number of vendors. Competitive Business Conditions We compete with many companies in the mining and mineral exploration and production industry, including large, established mining companies with substantial capabilities, personnel, and financial resources. There is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available for claim-staking, lease, or acquisition in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, and other areas where we may conduct our mining or exploration activities. We may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring mineral properties, since we compete with these individuals and companies, many of which have significantly greater financial resources and larger technical staffs than we do. From time to time, specific properties or areas that would otherwise be attractive to us for exploration or acquisition may be unavailable due to their previous acquisition by other companies or our lack of financial resources. Competition in the industry is not limited to the acquisition of mineral properties, but also extends to the technical expertise to find, advance, and operate such properties; the labor to operate the properties; and the capital for the purpose of funding such exploration and development. Many competitors not only explore for and mine precious and base metals but conduct refining and marketing operations on a world-wide basis. Such competition may result in our company not only being unable to acquire desired properties, but to recruit or retain qualified employees or to acquire the capital necessary to fund our operation and advance our properties. Our inability to compete with other companies for these resources could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and cash flows. Human Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, we had 200 employees in Mexico and 5 in the United States. All our employees based in the United States work in an executive, technical or administrative position, while our employees in Mexico include management, laborers, craftsmen, mining, geologist environmental specialists, information technologists, and various other support roles. We also frequently engage independent contractors in connection with certain administrative matters and the exploration of our properties, such as drillers, geophysicists, geologists, and other specialty technical disciplines. For the United States, we also engage independent contractors for technical and professional expertise. None of our employees in M xico are covered by union contracts and the Company believes we have good relations with our employees. As part of our fundamental need to attract and retain talent, we regularly evaluate our compensation, benefits and employee wellness offerings. We have determined that our compensation arrangements are competitive in the industry. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Not applicable for smaller reporting companies. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS N/A ITEM 2. PROPERTIES The Company leases office space for its corporate headquarters in Irving, Texas. In September 2017, the Company entered into a sixty six-month extension of the lease through January 2023. As part of the agreement the Company received six months free rent as a finish out allowance. The Company capitalized the leasehold improvement costs and amortized them over the rent abatement period as rent expense. The Company makes tiered lease payments on the 1st of each month. We classify our mineral property as an exploration property and our Company as being in the exploration stage. The Registrant is an exploration stage company and has started extraction without determining mineral reserves. SAN JOSE DE GRACIA - PROPERTY DESCRIPTION Location The San Jose de Gracia mining project SJG Project is located on map sheet G13-A81 in the Culiacan mining district of Sinaloa State, Mexico, at Latitude 26 , 9 N, Longitude 107 , 53 W, approximately 120 kilometers east northeast of the coastal city of Los Mochis. The property on which the SJG Project resides, straddles the border separating the Mexican States of Sinaloa and Chihuahua. The SJG Project is located in the south-western portion of the property, and is located entirely within the State of Sinaloa (see Figure 1). The property is without known reserves. The Company is an exploration stage company and the Company has started extraction without determining mineral reserves. 5 Table of Contents Figure 1. San Jose de Gracia, Location Map DynaResource de Mexico S.A. de C.V. DynaMexico ), the Company s 100 owned subsidiary, owns the San Jose de Gracia mineral concessions, which are comprised of 33 distinct concessions covering an aggregate of approximately 9,920 hectares. The concessions are held 100 by DynaMexico with no royalty or other interests clouding them. By way of further reference, the property on which the SJG Project resides is located in and around the village of San Jose de Gracia, approximately 100 km northeast of Guamuchil, on the west side of Mexico. The village of San Jose de Gracia has a small airstrip and can be accessed by a small airplane, or alternatively, by a dirt mountain road. There are roads providing access to the property on which the SJG Project resides. These roads are accessible throughout the year, with the possible exception of June and July when the rainy season sometimes causes flooding and runoff to make the roads too muddy to navigate. Local Resources and Infrastructure Accommodations The Village of San Jose de Gracia maintains few stores which offer only minimal goods. The camp site area maintains facilities of twelve rooms with additional lodging available in the town which can accommodate a total of about 225 persons. Power A power line to the San Jos de Gracia Project has been installed by the Comisi n Federal de Electricidad, the only authorized power producer in Mexico. The power line was installed in March 2012 from the La Estancia area of the municipality of Sinaloa de Leyva, a distance of approximately 75 kilometers. The power line is currently 220 volts maximum capacity, which supports domestic use only, including the office and camp facilities at SJG, such as water pump, air conditioning, refrigeration, lights, internet, and fans, as well as local residential use. The SJG Project can produces its own diesel-generated power as a backup to the power grid. Offices Camp Facilities DynaMexico maintains an administrative and logistics office in Guamuchil. The SJG Project sources many of its supplies from Guamuchil, from Los Mochis and from Culiacan. There is a satellite dish installed at the SJG Property, providing communications from the SJG Property to Guamuchil. At the SJG Project, DynaMexico maintains a camp staff, including geologists, field helpers, consultants, security, cooks and cleaners. Most of these employees come from outside of the local community. Mining Concessions The San Jos de Gracia Property consists of 33 contiguous mining concessions and covers an area of approximately 9,920 hectares (24,513 acres) as illustrated in Figure 2.

For the San Miguel concession, DynaMexico has entered into transfer agreements with the registered owners of 50 of the concession title, and DynaMexico has also entered into promise to sell and purchase agreements with registered owners of the balance of the concession title. Under Mexican law, such agreements require the consent or relinquishment of first rights of refusal from the registered owners of 100 of the concession title, in order to have legal effect and be eligible for registration before the Mines Recorders Office. Under amendments to the Mining Act of Mexico that came into effect in December 2006, the classifications of Mining Exploration Concessions and Mining Exploitation Concessions were replaced by a single classification of Mining Concessions valid for a renewable term of 50 years, commencing from the initial issuance date. To be converted into Mining Concessions at the time these amendments came into effect, former mining exploration and mining exploitation concessions had to be in good standing at the time of conversion. All of the SJG concessions were in good standing and consequently were converted to 50-year Mining Concessions in December 2006, at the time the amendments to the Mining Act came into effect. To renew the 50-year term, Mining Concessions must be in good standing at the time an application for renewal is filed, and an application for renewal must be filed within 5 years prior to expiration of the term. To maintain Mining Concessions in good standing, the registered owner must (a) pay bi-annual mining duties in advance, by January 31 and July 31 each year, (b) file assessment work reports by May 30 each year, for the preceding year (some exceptions apply), and (c) by January 31 each year, file statistical reports on exploration / exploitation work conducted for the preceding year. Notice of Commencement of Production Activities and Annual Production Reports must be filed annually by January 31 each year for those concessions where mineral ore extraction is taking place. As a general provision, registered owners of Mining Concessions must follow environmental and labor laws and regulations in order to maintain their Mining Concessions in good standing.

DynaMexico will be required to obtain further permits in order to conduct drilling in these four areas and the other areas, and in order to carry out future mining, milling, and production activities, and will timely obtain such permits, as and when required. HISTORY OF SAN JOSE DE GRACIA Production at San Jos de Gracia dates from the 1800 s and totals approximately one million ounces of gold mined from high-grade quartz veins. Large-scale mining in the camp began in 1870 and ended in 1910 with the onset of the Mexican Revolution. The majority of the production came from the Anglo, Rosario and La Cruz Mines on the Purisima Ridge trend, and from the La Prieta Mine on the La Prieta trend (reference Fig. 2). The remainder of the production was derived from as many as 60 smaller mines throughout the 12 square kilometer area, including the Palos Chinos, San Pablo, Tres Amigos, La Cece a, Los Hilos, Santa Rosa, Veta Tierra, La Union, Santa Eduwiges, Mochemara and La Parilla Mines.

Recent Ownership of the Property By 1977 the underlying owners of the mining concessions and subsequent vendors to Minera Finisterre SA de CV. Finesterre succeeded in acquiring control of most of the district, and installed a 70 ton per day flotation concentrator. Finisterre subsequently acquired the property through option agreements with the underlying vendors and continued some exploration work, although most of its financial resources were expended in erecting a larger, 200 ton per day concentrator. Golden Hemlock Explorations Ltd., a Canadian company, obtained an option to acquire majority control of Finisterre and commenced work on the property in 1997. The actual exploration and development work was performed by Perforaci nes Quest de Mexico PQM ), which was under contract to Finesterre, and whose efforts consisted primarily of core drilling, trenching and mapping. PQM completed a 63-hole, 6,000-meter core drilling program in 1997. In 1998-1999, Pamicon Developments Ltd., a Canadian company, examined the results of the 1997 drilling program, including PQM s technical work, in order to calculate possible mineral reserves, and to review the general status of the property. Results of this examination were presented in a report dated September 1999. During the first half of 1999, DynaResource, Inc. and its agents arranged to collect samples for metallurgical testing. In June of 2000, DynaResource formed its subsidiary DynaMexico, in order to acquire and consolidate ownership of the San Jose de Gracia Project. By December 2003, DynaMexico had completed the acquisition of and consolidation of 100 of the San Jose de Gracia Project from Golden Hemlock and Finisterre -- with the sole exception of the San Miguel mining concession. Test Mining Operations The property is without known reserves and the test mining program is exploratory in nature and the Company has started extraction without determining mineral reserves. All mines are underground and the ore is hard rock that needs to be crushed and ground before gold concentrate can be extracted. The Company is an exploration stage company and has a test mining facility and produces precious metal concentrates for sale to third parties. Summary of Test Mining and Pilot Mill Operations for 2018 to 2022: Total Tonnes Mined Reported Mill Feed Grade (g/t Reported Recovery Gross Gold Concentrates Recovered Net Gold Concentrates Sold Year Processed Au) (Au oz.) (Au oz.) 2018 52,038 9.82 86.11 14,147 13,418 2019 66,031 5.81 86.86 10,646 9,713 2020 44,218 5.65 87.31 7,001 5,828 2021 97,088 9.67 88.79 26,728 22,566 2022 137,740 8.18 88.05 31,905 25,554 Test pilot operations in 2022 yielded 137,740 Tonnes of material, mined and processed from underground test mining activity and pilot milling operations. These test pilot operations also yielded approximately 31,905 gross ounces of gold, and net of dry weight adjustments at the buyer s facilities, the approximately 25,554 ounces of gold. Infrastructure Improvements, Expansion and Increased Output (2017 To 2022) The Registrant is an exploration stage company and the registrant has started extraction without determining mineral reserves. As part of the Company s test mining operations, it continues to upgrade the camp facilities and the mill. Significant improvements have been made such that the condition of the equipment is new, relatively new or in good condition. The Company has developed a total of five mills of which three are currently running which can process approximately 700 tons of mined material per day. The Companies two oldest Mills were taken offline in 2022 as the two newest ball mills were brought on line and the old mills will be refitted. The Company continues its exploration at San Jose de Grac a, in order to increase production of gold ounces. Since January 2015 startup of the test mining and milling activities, the Company has increased daily output from an initial 75 tons per 24-hour operating day, to a current 700 tons per 24-hour operating day. Since January 2017, the Company has expended funds to improve the mine, the mill and the facilities in order to increase the production at San Jose de Gracia.as follows: Mill Expansion 7,093,000 Tailings Pond Expansion 1,464,000 Machinery and Equipment 2,315,000 Mining Camp Expansion 146,000 Total 11,018,000 The Company is currently in the middle of exploration drilling to further define mineralization and in 2022 expended 2,484,072 for this drilling. The Company is currently an exploration stage issuer and is reporting all costs of mine operations, improvements, and expansion as expenses in accordance with section 1300 of Regulation S-K and United States General Accepted Accounting Principal (GAAP) requirements, and therefore the above costs are not reflected as capitalized expenses (assets) on the Company s balance sheet. 9 Table of Contents ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY Topography, Physiography, and Vegetation The topography of the San Jos de Gracia district is generally rugged with elevations varying from 400 meters in the valley bottoms to over 1600 meters in the higher Sierra. A network of small roads and tracks winds around areas nearer the old workings at San Jos de Gracia. Access to the remainder of the large property at the current stage of development is difficult without the use of horse or helicopter. The SJG Project can be accessed by road, from either the City of Culiacan or the City of Guamuchil. Either route goes through the small town of Sinaloa de Leyva, then from Sinaloa de Leyva by gravel mountainous road to the village of San Jos de Gracia (population 250), which covers approximately 90 kilometers and is roughly a five hour trip. The SJG Project can also be accessed by air. A gravel airstrip is located adjacent to the San Jose de Gracia Village. The airstrip is suitable for light aircraft and charter flights of 45 minutes duration are available from the cities of Los Mochis or Culiacan. Much of the labor for the recent mining and production activities of DynaMexico was provided by the village residents. Although the village provided approximately 75 employees to DynaMexico, it currently has limited services. Climate and Operating Season The climate is semi-tropical with a rainy season dominating from late June / early July through September. For some activities on the SDJ project, operations may be suspended during the rainy season. MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING Bulk Sample, Hazen Process Development Metallurgical Report Ore and existing mill tailings samples were collected prior to DynaMexico s acquisition and consolidation of San Jose de Gracia. The ore samples consisted of a bulk (about 500 kg) of stockpiled ore from the lower adit of the Tres Amigos mine (intercept of the Tres Amigos and Orange Tree veins). In addition, approximately 100 kg of ore as a bulk sample was taken from the surface at the Gossan Cap area. Three additional ore samples (approximately 5-15 kg each) were assembled from splits of the cores from several of the 1997 drilling program core holes to develop samples representing different ore types for testing. These included: 1) composite drill cores from Palos Chinos, 2) massive sulfide from the Tres Amigos vein and 3) disseminated, nonsurprise mineralized zones at the bottom of several Tres Amigos core holes. The logic was that major exploratory test work to define a metallurgical process would be done on the bulk sample from the adit at Tres Amigos and the other samples would have limited testing done at the selected metallurgical process conditions to verify the performance of the selected metallurgical process circuit on other types of San Jos mineralization. Finally, several bulk samples (50-100 kg) of existing tailings from the Rosarito mill and the old Rosarito mill were collected and used to conduct flotation, gravity, and limited leachability test work on the tailings. Samples were shipped to the laboratory of Carbonyx Carbon Technologies in Plano, Texas where in 2000 and 2001 two separate preliminary test programs were conducted, one for the tailings, and the other for a portion of the bulk Tres Amigos ore.The Company developed a concept for the metallurgical processing to produce both gravity and flotation concentrates (rougher and cleaner). The tests confirmed a metallurgical flow sheet to be utilized at San Jos to recover up to 90 of the feed gold into the concentrates. The above in-house testing established a preliminary flowsheet for a mill circuit for processing either primary ore or for reprocessing the existing tailings. Subsequently Hazen Research Laboratories of Golden, Colorado Hazen was engaged to provide independent verification of the in-house work and carry out additional optimization test work. Lockwood Greene/ Mr. Henderson prepared and verified completion of the scope of work. In summary, various interim reports and the final metallurgical report, the "Official Hazen Test Report, Hazen Report provided results as follows: (a) The initial gravity beneficiation/flotation test work on the Tres Amigos and Gossan Cap bulk ore samples were very encouraging with up to 80 recovery of the feed gold into the gravity concentrates while maintaining a minimum concentrate grade of 100 g Au/t (b) The existing tailings samples (feed grades of 3 -8 g Au/t) returned similar recovery results, but had to be cleaned to produce a final concentrate with > 100 g Au/t (c) The overall gold recoveries into the gravity cleaner concentrate still were in excess of 50 of the total feed gold (d) Flotation tests on primary ore samples resulted in recoveries of 85 - 90 of the feed gold into the rougher concentrates, however, recoveries after cleaning (to get > 100 g Au/t grade) dropped to the 65-75 range and A combination circuit of a gravity pre-concentration stage with flotation on the gravity tailings indicated the potential to recover > 90 of the feed gold into the gravity concentrate, the rougher flotation and the cleaner flotation concentrates while maintaining a 100 g Au/t grade in all of the concentrates. EXPLORATION UPDATE DynaResource uses a multiple phase method of exploration. The initial activity consists of surface mapping and sampling to identify areas of interest. The next phase is detailed mapping and systematic sampling. Mapping and sampling of mine workings are also performed to define potential areas for future work. Geological mapping and samples have been collected in the past and sent for laboratory analysis by the Company. The prospects are then catalogued and prioritized for drilling. Since January 2022, six (6) areas have been drill-tested. They are: Tres Amigos, La Union, San Pablo, Tepehuaje, La Cece a and Palos Chinos. In 2022, 166 holes for approximately 24,500 m of diamond drilling was completed and approximately 16,000 core samples were collected of which approximately 500 QA/QC samples were shipped for laboratory analysis. EXPLORATION PLANS FOR 2023 The Company plans to continue its drilling program with two to six rigs on site. During this period management will make decisions based on the drill results, corporate strategies and market conditions, surface mapping, sampling and target generation. These activities will continue until any increase is approved by the Board of Directors. The Company plans to contract with a consultant to interpret the data collected for a formal Mineral Resource update in the latter part of 2023 or early 2024. TECHNICAL DISCLOSURE All technical disclosures and resource estimate covering the Company's mineral property was prepared under the supervision of Mr. Francisco M Carranza Sr, CPG-11933, Consulting Geologist for the Company and a "Qualified Person" within the meaning of subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K.

Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, the Company had working capital of 11,789,578, comprised of current assets of 33,123,955 and current liabilities of 21,334,377. This represented an increase of 10,661,867 from the working capital maintained by the Company of 1,347,711 as of December 31, 2021. The primary reason for the increase is the cash, inventory and receivables from the Company s operating profit and from funds raised by the issuance of common stock. Net cash provided by (used in) operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was (1,781,225) compared to 17,516,205 in the year ended December 31, 2021.

Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Derivative Liabilities As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the derivative liabilities represent the embedded conversion features of the Series D Warrants. The Company has classified the derivative liabilities as Level 3 liabilities and the fair value of the liabilities are evaluated each reporting period. As of December 31, 2022, the derivative liabilities were 2,172,417. The derivative liabilities include both quantitative and qualitative components. The calculation of the fair value of the derivative liabilities used a Black-Scholes pricing model. Key components of the fair value calculation included: the annual volatility rate, the risk-free rate, the remaining term, and the fair value of the underlying common stock. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of the derivative liabilities is a critical audit matter is: there was significant judgment and estimation used by management in determining the fair value of the derivative liabilities, which led to an increased level of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the derivative liabilities, including the qualitative component. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included documenting the control environment in which judgements were made. These procedures also included, testing the reasonableness of the assumptions management used in the Black-Scholes pricing model, recalculating the change in fair value, and performing a stress-test on the assumptions.

Leases In addition to the surface rights held by DynaM xico pursuant to the Mining Act of M xico and its Regulations Ley Minera y su Reglamento ), DynaMineras maintains access and surface rights to the SJG Project pursuant to the 20-year Land Lease Agreement. The Year Land Lease Agreement with the Santa Maria Ejido Community surrounding San Jose de Grac a was dated January 6, 2014 and continues through January 2033. It covers an area of surrounding the main mineral resource areas of SJG and provides for annual lease payments on January 1st each year by DynaMineras of pesos adjusted for inflation based on the Mexico minimum wage increase commencing in 2014. Rent was Pesos (approx. USD) for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Land Lease Agreement provides DynaMineras with surface access to the core resource areas of SJG (4,399 hectares), and allows for all permitted mining and exploration activities from the owners of the surface rights (Santa Maria Ejido community). The Company leases office space for its corporate headquarters in Irving, Texas. In September 2017, the Company entered into a sixty-six-month extension of the lease through January 2023. As part of the agreement the Company received six months free rent as a finish out allowance. The Company capitalized the leasehold improvement costs and amortized them over the rent abatement period as rent expense. The Company makes tiered lease payments on the 1st of each month. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC 842, which requires recognition of a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the Company's leasing arrangements are also required. The Company adopted ASC 842 prospectively and elected the package of transition practical expedients that does not require reassessment of (1) whether any existing or expired contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. In addition, the Company has elected other available practical expedients to not separate lease and non-lease components, which consist principally of common area maintenance charges, for all classes of underlying assets and to exclude leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. The Company determines if a contract is or contains a lease at inception. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has two operating leases - a six- and one-half year lease for office space with a remaining term of one month and a twenty-year ground lease in association with its M xico mining operations with a remaining term of eleven years. Variable lease costs consist primarily of variable common area maintenance, storage parking and utilities. The Company s leases do not have any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. As the implicit rate is not readily determinable for most of the Company s lease agreements, the Company uses an estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the initial present value of lease payments. These discount rates for leases are calculated using the Company's interest rate of promissory notes. Operating Lease Ground Lease Short Term Lease Costs Variable Lease Costs TOTAL Weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate are as follows: Weighted Average Remaining Lease Term (Years) Operating Leases Weighted Average Discount Rate Operating Leases Estimated future minimum lease obligations are as follow for the years ending December 31: YEAR 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Less Imputed Interest OPERATING LEASE LIABILITY 29 Table of Contents Risk free rate Remaining Term years years Fair Value of common stock For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, an active market for the Company s common stock did not exist. Accordingly, the fair value of the Company s common stock was estimated using a valuation model with level 3 inputs. The below table represents the change in the fair value of the derivative liability during the nine and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 2015 Warrant As discussed in Note 7, the Company analyzed the embedded conversion features of the Series C Preferred Stock and determined that the 2015 Warrant (issued at the same time as the Series C Preferred Stock) qualified as a derivative liability and is required to be accounted for as such. The Company performed a valuation applying the guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements , to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). To measure fair value, the Company incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and utilizes market data to the maximum extent possible. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The Company considered the inputs in this valuation to be level 3 in the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 (see note 12) and used an equity simulation model to determine the value of the 2015 Warrant based on the assumptions below: Risk free rate Remaining Term years years Fair Value of common stock For the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, an active market for the Company s common stock did not exist.

Warrants issued with the Notes convertible into Series D Preferred As discussed in Note 7, the Company analyzed the conversion features of the promissory notes convertible into Series D Preferred and determined that the 2020 warrants and remaining purchaser warrants issued with such notes qualified as a derivative liability. The fair value was required to be allocated among the notes, the notes conversion features, and the 2020 warrants and remaining purchaser warrants, and then remeasured at each reporting date. The Company performed a valuation of the conversion feature of the 2020 warrants and remaining purchaser warrants. In performing the valuation, the Company applied the guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements , to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
