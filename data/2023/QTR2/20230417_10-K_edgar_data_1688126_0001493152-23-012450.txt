to better reflect our new business. Our company address is currently located at 23823 Malibu Road, # 50477, Malibu, California and our
telephone number is (424) 228-9955. Our website can be accessed at www.thecryptocompany.com. The information contained on or that may

the 2021 and 2022 fiscal years the Company generated revenues and incurred expenses primarily through the business of providing consulting
services and education for distributed ledger technologies blockchain ), for the building of technological infrastructure
and enterprise blockchain technology solutions. 

The

Overview
of Our Business 

We
are engaged in the business of providing consulting services and education for blockchain technology and for the building of
technological infrastructure and enterprise blockchain technology solutions. During 2022 we generated revenues and incurred expenses
primarily through these consulting operations. In February 2022 we acquired bitcoin mining equipment and entered into an arrangement
with a third party to host and operate the equipment. We generated some minimal revenue from this mining arrangement. However by the
end of 2022 we exited that Bitcoin mining business because we determined that it wasn t profitable. 

Strategic
Acquisitions 

In
furtherance of the development of our blockchain consulting services, we may seek from time to time additional strategic acquisitions
of assets and / or majority and minority equity interests in entities and technology with characteristics such as (i) established, protectable
and scalable revenues; (ii) substantial market share; (iii) established brand equity and customer loyalty; (iv) proprietary technology
with competitive advantages; (v) quality personnel, and (vi) strategic access to international markets. Similarly, we may seek to acquire
additional assets that complement our business or otherwise enter into strategic relationships as a means to grow our business operations
and revenues. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
regard our service marks as having significant value and as being important factors in the marketing of our products and services. Our
policy is to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our marks. 

Market
Overview 

Blockchain 

The
blockchain is a decentralized database or digital ledger of transactions across a peer-to-peer network of computers or
 nodes that use the underlying infrastructure of the Internet to validate and process valuable transactions. While using
the blockchain, participants can transfer information across the Internet without the need of a central third party. In a financial transaction,
the buyer and seller interact directly without the need for verification by a trusted third-party intermediary. The actual record of
the transaction is pseudonymous, but the identifying information is encrypted, preventing personal information from being shared. 

The
benefits of blockchain include the following: 

Fraud
 reduction : Blockchain technology has the potential to positively disrupt most industries since it can work for nearly every type
 of transaction that involves value, including money, property, and goods. From a business perspective, the technology may be leveraged
 for process improvement, helping to reduce human error, prevent fraud, and streamline data storage. 

Transparency :
 Financial organizations may use the blockchain to store records digitally and leverage the technology for any type of transaction
 that needs to be verified by a trusted third party. 

Security :
 Transactions may include transferring digital or physical assets, verifying chain of custody, and protecting intellectual property.
 In an era with increasing cybercrime and strict regulatory requirements, blockchain offers a highly fraud-resistant technology that
 can protect and authenticate almost any type of transaction. 

Efficiency :
 Both Permissioned and Public blockchains offer significant improvements in efficiency to retail and business implementations by reducing
 cost and time in the duplicate databases and ledgers that companies and intermediaries must maintain in the absence of a shared,
 trusted and immutable system. 

4 

Competition 

We
have a number of competitors, ranging in size, consisting primarily of other similar consulting firms. We believe our main competitors
are ConsenSys, Natsoft Corporation, Quest Global Technologies, and CGI Inc. In addition, global audit and assurance firms typically provide
consulting services. Additionally, there are numerous additional other companies that indirectly compete with us in the educational space. 

Governmental
Regulations 

Various
uses of blockchain technology are subject to regulation by various governmental entities such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the SEC ), the U.S. Commodities Future Trading Commission CFTC ), Federal Trade Commission FTC ),
and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN of the U.S. Department of the Treasury) and governmental bodies in
other countries. Other regulatory bodies are governmental or semi- governmental and have shown an interest in regulating or investigating
companies engaged in the blockchain business (NASDAQ, NYSE, FINRA, state securities commissions). 

Blockchain
aimed regulations are evolving with agencies investigating businesses and their practices, gathering information, and generally trying
to understand the risks and uncertainties in order to protect investors in these businesses. Regulations will likely increase, in many
cases, although it is presently not possible to know how they will increase, how regulations will apply to the Company s businesses,
or when they will be effective. Various bills have also been proposed in congress for adoption-related to the Company s business
which may be adopted and have an impact on it. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, the Company may become subject to new
laws and further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, although the Company is not currently trading in digital assets and has no
intention to trade in digital assets. 

Employees 

As
of April 1,2023 we had 8 full-time employees. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract,
hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we believe that our employee relations
are good.

Recent
Events 

COVID-19
Pandemic 

On
March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic. In addition
to the devastating effects on human life, the pandemic is having a negative ripple effect on the global economy, leading to disruptions
and volatility in the global financial markets, causing global supply chain disruptions and contributing to shortages in the labor market.
Most U.S. states and many countries at times have issued policies intended to stop or slow the further spread of the disease. 

COVID-19
and the U.S. s response to the pandemic have contributed to economic volatility. There are no comparable events that provide guidance
as to the effect the COVID-19 pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate effect of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject
to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the effects on the economy, the markets we serve, our business or our operations. 

Results
of Continuing Operations 

Comparison
of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 

Revenue
and cost of services 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues relating to consulting services were 619,538, compared to 434,552 for the year ended December
31, 2021. The increase in revenue is attributable to the acquisition of BTA. The operations of BTA became consolidated with Company operations
on April 8, 2021. 

Cost
of services for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were 369,313 and 273,796 respectively. The increase is attributable
to the acquisition of BTA and is comprised of payroll expense. 

General
and administrative expenses and share-based compensation 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, our general and administrative expenses were 1,864,543 an increase of 26.7 compared to 1,471,226
for the year ended December 31, 2021. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs relating to professional services,
payroll and payroll-related expenses for the Company excluding payroll at BTA, and depreciation and amortization expenses. Professional
services included in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of contracting fees, consulting fees, accounting fees, and
legal costs. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflects increased costs associated with being a public company including
outside consulting, legal, and accounting costs, and costs incurred to effect the BTA acquisition and other business development efforts. 

Share-based
compensation was 2,104,126 for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 186 compared to 736,144 for the year ended December
31, 2021. Share-based compensation increased due to warrant issuances in 2022 to various lenders as compared to less issuances in 2021. 

Other
Income 

Other
income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 85,865 compared to 1,293,483 during the same period in 2021. The decrease in other income
is primarily attributable to the recovery of token investments that had been previously written off amounting to 1,164,662 during the
year ended December 31, 2021. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with United States U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred significant losses
and experienced negative cash flows since inception. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash on hand of 110,606. Our loss before provision
for income taxes from continuing operations was 5,662,918 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our working capital was negative 4,234,978
as of December 31, 2022. 

During
2022 we funded our operations with various loans as described in the Report. We intend to continue funding our operations through debt
instruments and, if possible, through equity issuances. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining additional
funding, and if funding can be obtained on favorable terms. 

8 

Operating
Activities 

We
have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in the areas of professional fees and contracting services. 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 1,930,308 compared to net cash used of 152,241 for the year
ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in profitability in 2022, net of non- cash share based compensation. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 50,000 compared to net cash used of 786,151 for the year
ended December 31, 2021. The difference is primarily attributable to the purchase by the Company of BTA in 2021 amounting to 786,1515
in cash used, compared to purchase of equipment of 50,000 in 2022 compared to -0- in the 2021 period.

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 2,015,215, compared to 987,765 for the year ended December
31, 2021. The increase of 1,027,450 was primarily the result of an increase of proceeds from issuance of notes payable of 2,606,146

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

In
accordance with ASC No. 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation ASC 718 ), the Company measures the compensation costs of
stock-based compensation arrangements based on the grant date fair value of granted instruments and recognizes the costs in financial
statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Stock-based compensation arrangements include stock
options. 

Equity
instruments instruments issued to non-employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required
by ASC 718. ASC No. 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees ASC 505 ), defines the measurement date and recognition
period for such instruments. In general, the measurement date is (a) when a performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) when
the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete and (ii) the instruments are vested. The compensation cost is remeasured
at fair value at each reporting period when the award vests. As a result, stock option-based payments to non-employees can result in
significant volatility in compensation expense. 

The
Company accounts for its stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. Using
this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to the (i) expected volatility of the Company s common stock
price, (ii) expected life of the award, which for options is the period of time over which employees and non-employees are expected to
hold their options prior to exercise, and (iii) risk-free interest rate. 

9 

Fair
Value Measurements 

The
Company recognizes and discloses the fair value of its assets and liabilities using a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to valuations based upon unadjusted quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to valuations based upon unobservable
inputs that are significant to the valuation (Level 3 measurements). Each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty
involved in determining fair value. 

Level 1 
 Inputs are unadjusted, quoted
 prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurable date. 

Level 2 
 Inputs, other than quoted
 prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with market data at the measurement
 date. 

Level 3 
 Unobservable inputs that
 reflect management s best estimate of what participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. 

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, including cash, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate
fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

Goodwill
and Indefinite-lived intangible Assets 

We
test for the impairment of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating
that a possible impairment has been incurred. 

We
perform our annual goodwill impairment test on the first day of our fourth quarter based on the income approach, also known as the discounted
cash flow DCF method, which utilizes the present value of future cash flows to estimate fair value. We also use the market
approach, which utilizes market price data of companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business as that of our company, to
estimate fair value. A reconciliation of the two methods is performed to assess the reasonableness of fair value of each of the reporting
units. 

The
future cash flows used under the DCF method are derived from estimates of future revenues, operating income, working capital requirements
and capital expenditures, which in turn reflect specific global, industry and market conditions. The discount rate developed is based
on data and factors relevant to the economies in which the business operates and other risks associated with those cash flows, including
the potential variability in the amount and timing of the cash flows. A terminal growth rate is applied to the final year of the projected
period and reflects our estimate of stable growth to perpetuity. We then calculate the present value of the respective cash flows for
each reporting unit to arrive at the fair value using the income approach and then determine the appropriate weighting between the fair
value estimated using the income approach and the fair value estimated using the market approach. Finally, we compare the estimated fair
value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets to its respective carrying value in order to determine if the goodwill assigned to
each reporting unit is potentially impaired. In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU
2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment , which eliminated
Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. If the fair value of the asset exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no
further testing is required. If the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the
amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount
of goodwill allocated to that asset. 

10 

Significant
assumptions used include management s estimates of future growth rates, the amount and timing of future operating cash flows, capital
expenditures, discount rates, as well as market and industry conditions and relevant comparable company multiples for the market approach.
Assumptions utilized are highly judgmental, especially given the role technology plays in driving the demand for consulting services
in the blockchain technology space. Based on the analysis that we performed at December 31, 2022, we determined that there was no impairment
of our goodwill or intangible assets. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes consulting revenue when the service is rendered, the fee for arrangement is fixed or determinable, and collectability
is reasonably assured. 

Income
Taxes 

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements
or tax returns. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.
A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
The provision for income taxes represents the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and
liabilities. 

When
tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities,
while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately
sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available
evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution
of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that
meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely
of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken
that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with any associated
interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Transactions 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet transactions. 

Trends,
Events and Uncertainties 

11 

The
blockchain technology market is dynamic and unpredictable. Although we undertake compliance efforts, including efforts with commercially
reasonable diligence, there can be no assurance that there will not be a new or unforeseen law, regulation or risk factor which will
materially impact our ability to continue our business as currently operated or raise additional capital to foster our continued growth. 

We
cannot assure you that our consulting business will develop as planned, that we will ever earn revenues sufficient to support our operations,
or that we will ever be profitable. Furthermore, since we have no committed source of financing, we cannot assure you that we will be
able to raise money as and when we need it to continue our operations. If we cannot raise funds as and when we need them, we may be required
to severely curtail, or even to cease, our operations. 

Other
than as discussed above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that
are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition.

Conclusions
Re g arding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2022. Based
upon management s hiring of two independent SEC accounting consultants with extensive public company experience and the Company s
adoption of new policies relating to disclosure controls management concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of December 31, 2022. 

Mana g ement s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Those rules define internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the Company; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles, and the receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
 authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of the company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, our management
used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO 2013). 

Based
on its assessment, management has concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting were effective. 

Chan g es
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations of Controls 

Management
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all
errors and all fraud. Controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls
can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.
The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Crypto Company: 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Crypto Company (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and
2021 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the two years in the period
ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern Matter 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations that raises substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 

We
determined that there are no critical audit matters.

THE
CRYPTO COMPANY 

 NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

. In addition, the Company s
net loss was for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the Company s had a working capital deficit of . As of
December 31, 2022 the accumulated deficit amounted to . As a result of the Company s history of losses and financial
condition, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.
Management is evaluating different strategies to obtain financing to fund the Company s expenses and achieve a level of revenue
adequate to support the Company s current cost structure. Financing strategies may include, but are not limited to, private placements
of capital stock, debt borrowings, partnerships and/or collaborations. There can be no assurance that any of these future-funding efforts
will be successful. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

- in investments in cryptocurrency on the Company s Balance Sheet. However, during
the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company received tokens from cryptocurrency investments that were previously written down to - -
value. These tokens were immediately liquidated, and the total proceeds received from them was and classified as Other
Income from the Recovery of Tokens in the Company s Statement of Operations. 

. Normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that materially adapt, improve, or alter the
nature of the underlying assets are capitalized. When equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to income. 

The
Company assesses whether goodwill impairment and indefinite lived intangible assets exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments.
The qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment the Company
determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects
not to perform a qualitative assessment, a quantitative assessment is performed to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at
the reporting unit. As of December 31, 2022 the Company determined that impairment had occurred. 

portions
of which will begin to . Utilization of some of the federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject
to annual limitations due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state
provisions. The annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. 

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, including cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate
fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

The
Company accounts for its share-based compensation using the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. Using
this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to the (i) expected volatility of the Company s common stock
price, (ii) expected life of the award, which for options is the period of time over which employees and non-employees are expected to
hold their options prior to exercise, and (iii) risk-free interest rate. 

of marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to for year ended December 31, 2021. 

In
February 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842) - Amendments to
SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on Effective Date Related to Accounting Standards
Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) which amends the effective date of the original pronouncement for smaller reporting companies.
ASU 2016-13 and its amendments will be effective for us for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022.
We believe the adoption will modify the way we analyze financial instruments, but we do not anticipate a material impact on results of
operations. We are in the process of determining the effects adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
