the context indicates otherwise, as used in this Annual Report, the terms HLLK, we, us, our, 
 our company and our business refer, to HALLMARK VENTURE GROUP, INC., including its subsidiaries named herein.
Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans,
objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements. 
These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believes, project, expects, 
 anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, may,

effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and
future prospects include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital,
interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in
evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. 

General
Background of the Company 

Hallmark
Venture Group, Inc. we , us , our or the Company was originally incorporated
in the State of Colorado on July 14, 1995, with the name CPC Office Systems, Inc. On July 12, 1999, the Company changed its name to Homesmart
USA, Inc. On March 3, 2006, the Company moved its domicile to Nevada. On March 8, 2006, the Company changed its name to Smart Truck Systems,
Inc. On March 6, 2008, the Company changed its name to Speech Phone, Inc. On July 16, 2008, the Company changed its name to Hallmark
Venture Group, Inc. On March 22, 2022, the Company redomiciled and became a Florida corporation. 

On
November 2, 2020, the Company entered into a Plan of Merger and Acquisition Agreement (the Stonecrest Merger Agreement ),
pursuant to which the Company purchased Stonecrest Owner, LLC in exchange for the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of common stock and 100,000
shares of Series A preferred stock to the members of Stonecrest Owner, LLC. On July 12, 2021, the parties agreed to cancel and unwind
the transactions contemplated by the Stonecrest Merger Agreement. As a result, all of the shares of common stock and preferred stock
that were issued as part of that transaction were canceled. 

The
Company can currently be defined as a shell company, whose sole purpose at this time is to locate and consummate a merger
or acquisition with a private entity. The Company has no particular acquisitions in mind and has not currently entered into any negotiations
regarding such an acquisition, provided, that the Company intends to pursue the direct or indirect acquisition and development of real
estate assets (including portfolios of real estate assets) and/or businesses related thereto. The Company s officers and directors
have not engaged in any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other company regarding the possibility of
an acquisition or merger between the Company and such other company as of the date hereof. 

Business
Objectives of the Company 

Since
August 2020, management has determined to direct its efforts and limited resources to pursue potential new business and/or acquisition
opportunities. The Company does not intend to limit itself to a particular industry and has not established any particular criteria upon
which it shall consider a business opportunity, provided, that management presently intends to prioritize the direct or indirect acquisition
and development of real estate assets (including portfolios of real estate assets) and/or businesses related thereto. 

3 

The
Company s purpose is to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented
to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of an issuer who has complied with the Exchange Act. The
Company will not restrict its search to any specific business, industry, or geographical location and the Company may participate in
a business venture of virtually any kind or nature and we have not established any particular criteria upon which we consider a business
opportunity, provided that we will prioritize real estate transactions. This discussion of the proposed business herein is purposefully
general and is not meant to be restrictive of the Company s broad discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities.
Management anticipates that it may be able to participate in only one potential business venture because the Company has nominal assets
and limited financial resources. 

Management
would have substantial flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective new business opportunity. The Company is dependent on the
judgment of its management in connection with this process. There are many criteria that management may deem relevant. In connection
with an evaluation of a prospective or potential business opportunity, management may be expected to conduct a due diligence review.
A business combination may involve an entity that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. In evaluating
a prospective business opportunity, management would consider, among other factors, the following: 

costs
 associated with pursuing a new business opportunity; 

the
 growth potential of the new business opportunity; 

necessary
 capital requirements; 

the
 competitive position of the new business opportunity; 

stage
 of business development; 

the
 market acceptance of the potential products and services; 

proprietary
 features and degree of intellectual property; and 

the
 regulatory environment that may be applicable to any prospective business opportunity 

The
foregoing criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and there may be other criteria that management may deem relevant. In connection
with an evaluation of a prospective or potential business opportunity, management may be expected to conduct a due diligence review. 

The
time and costs required to pursue new business opportunities, which includes negotiating and documenting relevant agreements and preparing
requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable securities laws, cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty. 

Management
intends to devote such time as it deems necessary to carry out our affairs. The exact length of time required for the pursuit of any
new potential business opportunities is uncertain. No assurance can be made that we will be successful in our efforts. We cannot project
the amount of time that management will devote to the Company s plan of operation. 

Prospective
investors in the Company s common stock will not have an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any of the one
or more business combinations that we may undertake. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company
that needs to raise substantial additional capital by means of being a publicly-traded company, while avoiding what it may deem to be
adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, voting control issues and
compliance with various federal and state securities laws. 

The
Company intends to conduct its activities to avoid being classified as an Investment Company under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), and therefore avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration
and other provisions of the Investment Company Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 

4 

Management
believes that being a reporting company under the Exchange Act will enhance the Company s efforts to acquire or merge with an operating
business. 

The
Company is obligated to file interim and periodic reports including an annual report with audited financial statements. This obligation
will substantially increase the expenses incurred by the Company. 

Any
entity that is merged into or acquired by us will become subject to the same reporting requirements to which we are subject. Thus, if
we successfully complete an acquisition or merger, the acquired entity must have audited financial statements for at least the two most
recent fiscal years, or if the acquired entity has been in business for less than two years, audited financial statements must be available
from its inception. This requirement limits our possible acquisitions or merger opportunities because many private companies either do
not have audited financial statements or are unable to produce audited financial statements without long delay and substantial expense. 

The
Company s common stock is subject to quotation on the OTC Markets Group Inc. Pink Market OTC Pink under the symbol
HLLK. There is currently only a limited trading market in the Company s common stock. There can be no assurance that there will
be an active trading market for our common stock. If an active trading market commences, there can be no assurance as to the market price
of our common stock, whether the trading market will provide liquidity to investors, or whether any trading market will be sustained.

Company s headquarters is located at 5112 West Taft Road, Suite M, Liverpool, NY 13088 . Our telephone number is 877-646-4833 . 

Implications
of Being an Emerging Growth Company 

We
qualify as an emerging growth company as defined under the Securities Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend
to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include,
but are not limited to: 

not
 being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (or
 the Sarbanes-Oxley Act); 

reduced
 disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 

exemptions
 from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute
 payments not previously approved. 

In
addition, an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting
standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards
would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period. We will remain an
emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (i) our reporting 1.07 billion or more in annual gross revenues; (ii) the end
of fiscal year 2024; (iii) our issuance, in a three year period, of more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt; and (iv) the end of
the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700 million on the last business day of
our second fiscal quarter.

7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes related thereto included elsewhere in this report. 

Overview 

We
have no operations from a continuing business other than the expenditures related to running the Company. All of our historical business
operations have ceased. 

Management
intends to explore and identify business opportunities within the U.S., including a potential acquisition of an operating entity through
a reverse merger, asset purchase or similar transaction. No assurances can be given that our management can identify and implement a
viable business strategy or that any such strategy will result in profits. Our ability to effectively identify, develop and implement
a viable plan for our business may be hindered by risks and uncertainties which are beyond our control, including without limitation,
the continued negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine on the U.S. and global economies. 

We
do not currently engage in any business activities that provide revenue or cash flow. During the next 12-month period we anticipate incurring
costs in connection with investigating, evaluating, and negotiating potential business combinations and/or asset acquisitions, filing
SEC reports, and consummating the acquisition of an operating business or assets. 

Given
our limited capital resources, we may consider a transaction with an entity which has recently commenced operations, is a developing
company or is otherwise in need of additional funds for the development of new products, services or assets, or expansion into new markets,
or is an established business or an established asset experiencing financial or operating difficulties and needs additional capital.
Alternatively, a transaction may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, an entity that desires access to the U.S. capital markets. 

As
of the date of this Form 10-K, our management has not had any discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a potential
business combination or asset acquisition. Any target business or asset that is selected may be financially unstable or in the early
stages of development. In such event, we expect to be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially
unstable or early-stage entity. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high
level of risk or in which our management has limited experience, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent
in a particular target business or asset, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. 

Our
management anticipates that we will likely only be able to effect just one business combination or asset acquisition due to our limited
capital. This lack of diversification will likely pose a substantial risk in investing in the Company for the indefinite future, because
it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture or operating territory against gains from another. The risks we face
will likely be heightened to the extent we acquire a business or assets operating in a single industry or geographical region. 

We
anticipate that the selection of a target business or asset will be a complex and risk-prone process. Because of general economic conditions,
including unfavorable conditions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, increasing inflation, rapid technological advances being made in
some industries and shortages of available capital, management believes that there are many firms seeking acquisition opportunities at
this time at discounted rates against which we will compete. We expect that any potentially available acquisition opportunities may appear
in a variety of different industries or regions and at various stages of development, all of which will likely make the task of comparative
investigation and analysis of such opportunities extremely difficult and complicated. 

7 

Once
we have developed and begun to implement our business plan, management intends to fund our working capital requirements through a combination
of our existing funds and future issuances of debt or equity securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in
line with the implementation of a business plan and commencement of operations. 

Based
upon our current operations, we do not have sufficient working capital to fund our operations over the next 12 months. If we are able
to close a business combination or other acquisition, it is likely we will need capital as a condition of closing that transaction. Because
of the uncertainties, we cannot be sure as to how much capital we need to raise or the type of securities we will be required to issue.
In connection with a business combination that is structured as a reverse merger, or in connection with the acquisition of significant
assets, we anticipate that we will be required to issue a controlling block of our securities to the target s shareholders or to
the owner of such assets, which will be very dilutive to existing shareholders. 

Additional
issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might
have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms,
or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective
new business endeavors or opportunities, including acquisition opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business
operations. 

We
anticipate that we will incur operating losses in the next 12 months, principally costs related to our being obligated to file reports
with the SEC. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in
their early stage of development. Such risks include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model, recognition
of revenue sources, and the management of growth. To address these risks, we must, among other things, develop, implement, and successfully
execute our business strategy, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. There can
be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on
our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Going
Concern 

We
have only limited capital. Additional financing is necessary for us to continue as a going concern. The report of the independent registered
public accounting firm accompanying our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 contains an explanatory paragraph
expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming
that we will continue as a going concern , which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments
in the ordinary course of business. 

Results
of Operations 

Year
Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no operations other than incurring expenditures related to running the Company, and
we generated no revenues. 

For
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had general and administrative expense of 103,574 and 143,936, respectively, a decrease
of 40,362 or 28 . Our operating expenses mainly consisted of professional fees and expenses. The decrease of operating expenses was
mainly due to a decrease of legal expense during the current year. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a total other expense of 184,972, which included 11,911 of interest expense and settlement
expense of 139,821. We also had amortization of debt discount of 7,862, a loss on the issuance of convertible debt of 32,993 and a
gain in the change of fair value of a derivative of 7,615. For the year ended December 31, 2021 we only had interest expense of 3,773.

We
had a net loss of 288,546 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a net loss of 147,709 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Our net loss increased due to the reasons discussed above. 

Our
major expenses consist of fees to consultants, lawyers and accountants incurred in connection with our obligation to file periodic reports
with the SEC, which entails payment of professional fees to accountants and lawyers. Otherwise, we do not expect the level of our operating
expenses to change in the future until we implement a business plan or effect an acquisition. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no cash on hand and there were outstanding liabilities of 898,348 and 779,500, respectively, the
majority of which were amounts owed to a related party. The working capital deficits were 898,348 and 779,500, respectively. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company used 64,474 of cash for operations as compared to 59,543 for the year ended December
31, 2021. Such increase was primarily due to higher net loss in the year ended December 31, 2021. The net cash provided by the financing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 64,474 as compared to 59,543 for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

John
D. Murphy, Jr., our President and Chief Executive Officer, individually, and through JMJ Associates, LLC, an entity controlled by him,
is funding our limited operations by making advances of funds to cover our operating expenses. The advances are repayable upon demand
and the obligations do not bear interest. We expect that Mr. Murphy, directly or through JMJ Associates, LLC, will continue to fund our
operations until we complete an acquisition or earlier if he sells his interest in the Company, and that we will continue to require
additional financing to maintain our existence as a shell company for the next twelve months. 

Paul
Strickland, our Secretary and Director, individually, and through Selkirk Global Holdings, LLC, an entity controlled by him, is funding
our limited operations by making advances of funds to cover our operating expenses. The advances are repayable upon demand and the obligations
do not bear interest. We expect that Mr. Strickland, directly or through Selkirk Global Holdings, LLC, will continue to fund our operations
until we complete an acquisition or earlier if he sells his interest in the Company, and that we will continue to require additional
financing to maintain our existence as a shell company for the next twelve months. 

Our
management is not required to fund our operations by any contract or other obligation. In the event that we undertake to complete an
acquisition that requires financing, we will likely depend on an outside source for such financing. However, we have not identified any
debt or equity financing sources that can be relied upon to provide such financing.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To: 
 The
 Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

Hallmark
 Venture Group, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Hallmark Venture Group, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the
related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31,
2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Explanatory
Paragraph Regarding Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
3 to the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit, incurred substantial losses during the year, and a negative working
capital, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regards to these
matters are described in Note 3. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
Critical Audit Matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. We determined
that there are no critical audit matters.

of liabilities that might incur in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. Management intends to seek additional capital
from new equity securities offerings, debt financing and debt restructuring to provide funds needed to increase liquidity, fund internal
growth and fully implement its business plan. However, management can give no assurance that these funds will be available in adequate
amounts, or if available, on terms that would be satisfactory to the Company.

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s
Report Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

During
the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods specified in the Commission s
rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
have been detected. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022, and this
assessment identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 

Due
 to our size and limited resources, we currently do not employ the appropriate accounting personnel to ensure (a) we maintain proper
 segregation of duties, (b) that all transactions are entered timely and accurately, and (c) we properly account for complex or unusual
 transactions; 

Due
 to our size and scope of operations, we currently do not have an independent audit committee in place; 

Due
 to our size and limited resources, we have not properly documented a complete assessment of the effectiveness of the design and operation
 of our internal control over financial reporting. 

In
making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Because of the material weaknesses
described in the preceding paragraphs, management concluded that, at December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial
reporting was not effective based on those criteria. 

10 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Attestation
Report of Independent Public Accounting Firm 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting because as a smaller reporting company we are not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm
pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report.

None
of our directors or officers are related to each other. There are no arrangements or understandings with any of our principal stockholders,

which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time,
(b) any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other

Director
Independence 

Our
Board of Directors may establish the authorized number of directors from time to time by resolution. Our Board of Directors is currently
comprised of two members. 

Audit
committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, subject to the transition
rule that is applicable to a newly public company. In order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit
committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the Board of Directors,
or any other board committee accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company
or any of its subsidiaries; or be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries. 

Role
of the Board of Directors in Risk Oversight 

The
Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the risks facing our company and considers risk in every business decision and as part
of our business strategy. The Board of Directors recognizes that it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk, and that strategic
and appropriate risk-taking is essential for us to compete in our industry and in the global market and to achieve our growth and profitability
objectives. Effective risk oversight, therefore, is an important priority of the Board of Directors. 

While
the Board of Directors oversees our risk management, management is responsible for day-to-day risk management processes. Our Board of
Directors expects management to consider risk and risk management in each business decision, to proactively develop and monitor risk
management strategies and processes for day-to-day activities and to effectively implement risk management strategies that are adopted
by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors expects to review and adjust our risk management strategies at regular intervals or
as needed. 

Code
of Business Conduct 

Our
Board of Directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, the Code of Business Conduct, to ensure that our
business is conducted in a consistently legal and ethical manner. Our policies and procedures cover all major areas of professional conduct,
including employee policies, conflicts of interest, protection of confidential information, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 

12 

Board
Committees 

Our
board does not currently have a standing Audit Committee, Compensation Committee or Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee due the
board s limited size and the Company s limited operations. The entire Board of Directors performs all functions that would
otherwise be performed by committees. Given the present size of our Board, it is not practical for us to have committees other than those
described above, or to have more than two directors on such committees. If we are able to grow our business and increase our operations,
we intend to expand the size of our board and our committees and allocate responsibilities accordingly.
