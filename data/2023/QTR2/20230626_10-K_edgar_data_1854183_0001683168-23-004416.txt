REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the shareholders and the board of
directors of Orion Bliss Corp 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Orion Bliss Corp. as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows
for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. 

Substantial Doubt about the Company s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has
suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience
negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 SINCE INCEPTION ON MARCH 23, 2022 TO APRIL 30,
2023 

at April 30, 2023 and at April 30, 2022. These factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company is attempting
to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support the
Company s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering. While the Company
believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional
funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s
ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public
or private offering. 

The financial statements do not include any adjustments
related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The extent of the impact
of the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak on the financial performance of the Company will depend on future developments, including
the duration and spread of the outbreak and related advisories and restrictions and the impact of COVID-19 on the overall economy, all
of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If the overall economy is impacted for an extended period, the Company s
future operating results may be materially adversely affected.

 towards incurred company s expenses. Furthermore, as of April 1, 2022 as per consulting agreement the director will be
compensated on a monthly basis 1,000 will accumulate in Accounts payable- related party. As of April 30, 2023 we owe to our

 par value shares of common stock authorized. 

On April 15, 2022 the
Company issued shares of common stock to a director for services rendered estimated to be at 0.0001 per share. 

In July, 2023, the Company
issued 65,500 shares of common stock to 3 shareholders in consideration of 1,310. 

In September and January
2023, the Company issued shares of common stock to 29 shareholders at 0.02 per share in consideration of . 

In November and December
2022 followed by January 2023, the Company issued shares of common stock to 5 shareholders at 0.02 per share in consideration

Voting Common Stock 

 All shares of common stock have voting rights
and are identical. All holders of shares of voting common stock shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote for
each share of the capital stock held by such stockholder. 

Non-voting Common Stock 

 All of the other terms of the Non-Voting Common
Stock shall be identical to the Voting Common Stock, except for the right of first refusal that attaches to the Non-Voting Common Stock,
as explained in the Company s Bylaws. 

Change in valuation allowance 

Tax benefit (expenses), net 

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
portions of the net deferred tax assets are as follows: 

Valuation allowance 

Deferred tax assets, net 

The Company has accumulated approximately 
of net operating losses NOL carried forward to offset future taxable income up to 20 years, if any, in future years which
begin to expire in year 2038. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers
the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs
for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not
historical or current facts are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 (the Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified
by the use of terms such as may, will, expect, believe, anticipate, estimate, 
 approximate or continue, or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to
the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future.
However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual
results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected.
We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 

Employees
and Employment Agreements 

At present, we have no employees other than our
officer and director. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans;
however, we may adopt such plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to any officers, directors or employees. 

Results of Operation 

Our financial statements have been prepared assuming
that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of
assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

We expect we will require additional capital to
meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt
securities.

Plan of Operation and Funding 

We expect that working capital requirements will
continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements
are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 

Existing working capital, further advances and
debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months. We have no
lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private
placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating
expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business;
and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter,
we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances
of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate
funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors
or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in
the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such
funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We
have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors, although no future arrangement for additional loans has
been made. We do not have any agreements with our directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future
equity financing. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of the date of this Yearly Report, we do not
have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
are material to investors. 

Going Concern 

The financial statements have been prepared assuming
that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments
in the ordinary course of business.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus
(COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant
disruptions to its economy, it has now spread to several other countries and infections have been reported globally. 

The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
the Company s operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with
confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19
pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in an
extended period of continued business disruption, reduced customer traffic and reduced operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot
be reasonably estimated at this time but is anticipated to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. 

The measures taken to date will impact the Company s
business for the fiscal fourth quarter and potentially beyond. Management expects that all of its business segments, across all of its
geographies, will be impacted to some degree, but the significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company s business
and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that
is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of April 30, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
