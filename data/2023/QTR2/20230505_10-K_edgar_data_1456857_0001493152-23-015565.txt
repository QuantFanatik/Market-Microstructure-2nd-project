Company
Overview 

MJ
Holdings, Inc. (OTCPK: MJNE) is a highly-diversified cannabis holding company providing cultivation management, asset and infrastructure
development currently concentrated in the Las Vegas market. It is the Company s intention to grow its business and provide
a 360-degree spectrum of infrastructure, including, cannabis cultivation, production of cannabis related products, management services,
dispensaries and consulting services. The Company intends to grow its business through joint ventures with existing companies possessing
complementary subject matter expertise, acquisition of existing companies and through the development of new opportunities. The Company
intends to prove the concept profitably in the rapidly expanding Las Vegas market and then use that anticipated success
as a template for replicating the concept in other developing states through a combination of strategic partnerships, acquisitions and
opening new operations. 

Operational
highlights: 

260
 acres of farmland for the purpose of cultivating additional marijuana (the 260 Acres purchased in January of 2019.
 The Company intends to utilize the state-of-the-art Cravo cultivation system for growing an additional five acres of
 marijuana on this property. The Cravo system will allow multiple harvests per year and should result in higher annual
 yields per acre. The land has more than 180-acre feet of permitted water rights, which will provide more than sufficient water to
 markedly increase the Company s marijuana cultivation capabilities. This facility, upon receipt of its business license in
 Nye County and its final inspection by the Cannabis Compliance Board CCB ), is expected to become operational in the
 summer of 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company elected to relocate all of its equipment utilized on the Acres
 lease to its 260 Acres adjacent to the Acres lease. The Company will utilize the 260 Acres for its own harvest along with additional
 harvests under any Cultivation and Sales Agreements 

Cultivation
 and Sales Agreements entered into for multiple grows on the Company s 260-acre farm located in the Amargosa Valley of Nevada.
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into separate Cultivation and Sales
 Agreements, whereby the Company shall retain certain independent growers to provide oversight and management of the Company s
 cultivation and sale of products at its 260-acre farm. The independent growers shall pay to the Company a royalty of net sales revenue
 with a minimum royalty after two years. As of the date of this filing, the Company is waiting on its business license in Nye County
 and its final inspection by the Cannabis Compliance Board before it can commence its operations under the Agreement. 

Commercial trailer and RV park (THC Park Tiny Home Community) was purchased in April of 2019 to supply necessary
 housing for the Company s farm employees. After the Company s 2018 harvest, it came to realize that it would need to
 find a more efficient method of housing and to bring its cultivation team to its facilities. The Company purchased the 50-acre plus
 THC Park for 600,000 in cash and 50,000 of the Company s restricted common stock. At present, the Company s construction
 and completion of this community is approximately seventy-five present complete. The impact of COVID-19 in obtaining inspections
 and permitting significantly delayed the completion of this community. The Company has elected to cease any renovations or additions
 at its Tiny Home Community but will continue to rent out those units that have been leased. 

Agreement to acquire a cultivation license and production license, both currently located in Nye County Nevada. On February 5,
 2021, the Company (the Purchaser executed a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement MIPA3 with MJ Distributing,
 Inc. (the Seller to acquire all of the outstanding membership interests of MJ Distributing C202, LLC and MJ Distributing
 P133, LLC, each the holder of a State of Nevada provisional medical and recreational cultivation license and a provisional medical
 and recreational production license. In consideration of the sale, transfer, assignment and delivery of the Membership Interests
 to Purchaser, and the covenants made by Seller under the MIPA3, Purchaser agreed to pay a combination of cash, promissory notes,
 and stock in the amount of One-Million-Two-Hundred-Fifty Thousand Dollars 1,250,000.00) in cash and/or promissory notes and 200,000
 shares of the Company s restricted common stock, all of which constitutes the consideration agreed to herein for (the Purchase
 Price ), payable as follows: (i) a non-refundable down payment in the amount of 300,000 was made on January 15, 2021,
 (ii) the second payment in the amount of 200,000 was made on February 5, 2021, (iii) a deposit in the amount of 310,000 was paid
 on February 22, 2021 210,000 was a pre-payment against future compensation due under the MIPA3), (iv) 200,000 was deposited on
 June 24, 2021, (v) 200,000 shall be deposited on or before June 12, 2021, and (vi) 250,000 shall be deposited within five (5) business
 days after the CCB provides notice on its agenda that the Licenses are set for hearing
 to approve the transfer of ownership from the Seller to the Purchaser. On April 12, 2022, the CCB issued an Adult-Use Production
 License to MJ Distributing P133, LLC and an Adult-Use Cultivation License to MJ Distributing C202, LLC. The Company is currently
 awaiting the transfer approval from the CCB. 

The
Company may also continue to seek to identify potential acquisitions of revenue producing assets and licenses within legalized cannabis
markets that can maximize shareholder value. 

The
Company may face substantial competition in the operation of cultivation facilities in Nevada. Numerous other companies have also been
granted cultivation licenses, and, therefore, the Company anticipates that it will face competition from these other companies. The Company s
management team has experience in successfully developing, implementing, and operating marijuana cultivation and related businesses in
other legal cannabis markets. The Company believes its experience in outdoor cultivation provides it with a distinct competitive advantage
over its competitors, and it will continue to focus on this area of its operations. The Company still faces challenges engaging and retaining
senior managers.

state, or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect its ability to operate its business. Strict enforcement of federal law
regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with its business plans, could expose the Company to potential criminal
liability, and could subject its properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance, or other business services may also
affect the Company s ability to operate its business. 

Marijuana
cultivation refers to the planting, tending, improving and harvesting of the flowering plant Cannabis, primarily for the production and
consumption of cannabis flowers, often referred to as buds . The cultivation techniques for marijuana cultivation differ
than for other purposes such as hemp production. Generally, references to marijuana cultivation and production do not include hemp production. 

Cannabis
belongs to the genus Cannabis in the family Cannabaceae and for the purposes of production and consumption, includes three species, C.
sativa Sativa ), C. Indica Indica ), and C. ruderalis Ruderalis ). Sativa and Indica generally
grow tall with some varieties reaching approximately 4 meters. The female plants produce flowers rich in tetrahydrocannabinol THC ).
Ruderalis is a short plant and produces trace amounts of THC but is very rich in cannabidiol CBD ), which is an antagonist
(inhibits the physiological action) to THC. 

As
of April 2023, there are a total of 40 states, plus the District of Columbia, with legislation passed as it relates to medicinal cannabis.
These state laws are in direct conflict with the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 811) CSA ),
which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is viewed as
having a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted use for medical treatment in the U.S., and lacks acceptable safety for use
under medical supervision. These 35 states, plus the District of Columbia, have adopted laws that exempt patients who use medicinal cannabis
under a physician s supervision from state criminal penalties. These are collectively referred to as the states that have de-criminalized
medicinal cannabis, although there is a subtle difference between de-criminalization and legalization, and each state s laws are
different. 

As
of April 2023, 21 states and the District of Columbia now allow for the recreational use and possession of small amounts of marijuana
and marijuana products. Decriminalization of marijuana varies by state. Decriminalization generally means that violators of local marijuana
laws may be subject to civil penalty rather than face criminal prosecution. Fifteen states have decriminalized the possession of small
amounts of marijuana but have not legalized possession. In these states decriminalization can mean possession of as little as ten grams
of marijuana up to one-hundred grams of marijuana that will not result in any criminal prosecution but may result in civil fines. In
three states, Idaho, South Dakota, and Kansas, the cultivation, possession or use of marijuana is strictly prohibited and violators may
be subject to criminal prosecution. In Nevada, where the Company is headquartered and has focused most of its activities, legalized marijuana
for recreational use was effective as of July 1, 2017, which made it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess
up to one ounce of marijuana flowers and one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up
to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, businesses can legally, pursuant to state regulations, cultivate, process, dispense,
distribute, and test marijuana products under certain conditions. 

12 

The
dichotomy between federal and state laws has limited the access to banking and other financial services by marijuana businesses. Recently
the U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ and the U.S. Department of Treasury issued guidance for banks considering conducting
business with marijuana dispensaries in states where those businesses are legal, pursuant to which banks must now file a Marijuana Limited
Suspicious Activity Report that states the marijuana business is following the government s guidelines with regard to revenue that
is generated exclusively from legal sales. However, since the same guidance noted that banks could still face prosecution if they provide
financial services to marijuana businesses, it has led to the widespread refusal of the banking industry to offer banking services to
marijuana businesses operating within state and local laws. In March of this year, U.S. Congressman Ed Perlmutter (D Colorado)
introduced house bill H.R. 1595, known as the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act to allow legally operating cannabis related
businesses to utilize traditional banking services without fear of federal agencies taking legal action against the banks or their customers.
The SAFE bill has strong bipartisan support in the House of Representatives and many industry observers anticipate it will be ratified
within the next year. 

The
DOJ has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana
for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity. 

In
the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana
and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to the Company s business and its revenue
and profits. 

Furthermore,
H.R. 83, known as the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment, is a rider to the annual appropriations bill that prohibits the DOJ from using federal
funds to prevent certain states, including Nevada and California, from implementing their own laws that authorized the use, distribution,
possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. This prohibition was in place until November 21, 2019. 

The
Company is monitoring the Biden administration s, the DOJ s, and Congress positions on federal marijuana law and policy.
Based on public statements and reports, the Company understands that certain aspects of those laws and policies are currently under review,
but no official changes have been announced. It is possible that certain changes to existing laws or policies could have a negative effect
on its business and results of operations.

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

You
should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors described below, in addition to the other information set forth
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto. Any of these risks,
uncertainties and other factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash
flows, or prospects. In that case, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
An investment in our securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should not invest in our securities if you cannot
bear the economic risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time and cannot afford to lose your entire investment. There may
be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also impair our business
and financial position. See also Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 

14 

Risks
Relating to Our Business and Industry 

The
report of our independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements includes a
going concern explanatory paragraph in which such firm expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities
and commitments in the normal course of business. However, we are a development stage company with current operations established in
October 2016. As of December 31, 2022, our accumulated deficit was 21,852,870. It is not possible at this time for us to predict with
assurance the potential success of our business. The revenue and income potential of our proposed business and operations are unknown.
If we cannot continue as a viable entity, we may be unable to continue our operations and you may lose some or all of your investment
in our common stock. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult for investors to predict future performance based on current operations. 

We
have a limited operating history upon which investors may base an evaluation of our potential future performance. In particular, we have
not proven that we can sell cannabis products in a manner that enables us to be profitable and meet customer requirements, obtain the
necessary permits and/or achieve certain milestones to develop our cultivation businesses, enhance our line of cannabis products, develop
and maintain relationships with customers and strategic partners, to raise sufficient capital in the public and/or private markets, or
respond effectively to competitive pressures. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or maintain consistent
revenue sources, or that our operations will be profitable and/or generate positive cash flow. 

Any
forecasts we make about our operations may prove to be inaccurate. We must, among other things, determine appropriate risks, rewards,
and level of investment in our product lines, respond to economic and market variables outside of our control, respond to competitive
developments and continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful
in meeting these challenges and addressing such risks and the failure to do so could have a materially adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, and financial condition. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently
encountered by companies in the early stage of development. As a result of these risks, challenges, and uncertainties, the value of your
investment could be significantly reduced or completely lost. 

We
will likely need additional capital to sustain our operations and will likely need to seek further financing, which we may not be able
to obtain on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to raise additional capital, as needed, our ability to implement our business model
and strategy could be compromised. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had limited capital resources and operations. Through that date, our operations had been funded primarily
from the proceeds of equity financings and through the sale of marketable securities. We may require additional capital in the near future to develop business operations at our
Farm Road facility in Amargosa, Nevada, to expand our production of our future franchise production lines, to develop our
intellectual property base, and establish our targeted levels of commercial production. We may not be able to obtain additional
financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In particular, because marijuana is illegal under federal law, we may have
difficulty attracting investors. 

We
have incurred losses in prior periods, and losses in the future could cause the quoted price of our Common Stock to decline or have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, our ability to pay our debts as they become due, and on our cash flows. 

We
have incurred losses in prior periods. For the year ended December 31,
2022, we incurred a net loss of 5,380,241 and had an accumulated deficit of 21,852,870. We had net income of 3,530,331
for the year ended December 31, 2021 and had an accumulated deficit of approximately 16,472,629. Any losses in the
future could cause the quoted price of our Common Stock to decline or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, our ability
to pay our debts as they become due, and on our cash flow. 

15 

Even
if we obtain financing for our near-term operations, we expect that we will require additional capital thereafter. Our capital needs
will depend on numerous factors including: (i) our profitability; (ii) the release of competitive products by our competition; (iii)
the level of our investment in research and development, and (iv) the amount of our capital expenditures, including acquisitions. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain capital in the future to meet our needs. 

If
we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership held by our existing
stockholders will be reduced and our stockholders may experience significant dilution. In addition, new securities may contain rights,
preferences, or privileges that are senior to those of our Common Stock. If we raise additional capital by incurring debt, this will
result in increased interest expense. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of securities, market fluctuations in the price
of our shares of Common Stock could limit our ability to obtain equity financing. 

We
cannot give you any assurance that any additional financing will be available to us, or if available, will be on terms favorable to us.
If we are unable to raise capital when needed, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely
affected, and we could be forced to reduce or discontinue our operations. 

We
face intense competition and many of our competitors have greater resources that may enable them to compete more effectively. 

The
industries in which we operate in general are subject to intense and increasing competition. Some of our competitors may have greater
capital resources, facilities, and diversity of product lines, which may enable them to compete more effectively in this market. Our
competitors may devote their resources to developing and marketing products that will directly compete with our product lines. Due to
this competition, there is no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in obtaining revenues and market share or in the positioning
of our products. There are no assurances that competition in our respective industries will not lead to reduced prices for our products.
If we are unable to successfully compete with existing companies and new entrants to the market this will have a negative impact on our
business and financial condition. 

If
we fail to protect our intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected. 

Our
viability will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our intellectual property to distinguish
our products from our competitors products. We rely on copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and confidentiality provisions to
establish and protect our intellectual property. 

Any
infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property could damage its value and limit our ability to compete. We may have to
engage in litigation to protect the rights to our intellectual property, which could result in significant litigation costs and require
a significant amount of our time. In addition, our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in
certain countries outside the United States, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries
by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us. 

Competitors
may also harm our sales by designing products that mirror our products or processes without infringing on our intellectual property rights.
If we do not obtain sufficient protection for our intellectual property, or if we are unable to effectively enforce our intellectual
property rights, our competitiveness could be impaired, which would limit our growth and future revenue. 

We
may also find it necessary to bring infringement or other actions against third parties to seek to protect our intellectual property
rights. Litigation of this nature, even if successful, is often expensive and time-consuming to prosecute and there can be no assurance
that we will have the financial or other resources to enforce our rights or be able to enforce our rights or prevent other parties from
developing similar products or processes or designing around our intellectual property. 

16 

Although
we believe that our products and processes do not and will not infringe upon the patents or violate the proprietary rights of others,
it is possible such infringement or violation has occurred or may occur, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

We
are not aware of any infringement by us of any person s or entity s intellectual property rights. In the event that products
we sell or processes we employ are deemed to infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights of others, we could be required to modify
our products or processes or obtain a license for the manufacture and/or sale of such products or processes or cease selling such products
or employing such processes. In such event, there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so in a timely manner, upon acceptable
terms and conditions, or at all, and the failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon our business. 

There
can be no assurance that we will have the financial or other resources necessary to enforce or defend a patent infringement or proprietary
rights violation action. If our products or processes are deemed to infringe or likely to infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights
of others, we could be subject to injunctive relief and, under certain circumstances, become liable for damages, which could also have
a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition. 

Our
trade secrets may be difficult to protect. 

Our
success depends upon the skills, knowledge, and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, our consultants and advisors, as
well as our licensors and contractors. Because we operate in several highly competitive industries, we rely in part on trade secrets
to protect our proprietary technology and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We enter into confidentiality or
non-disclosure agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, developers, and other
advisors. These agreements generally require that the receiving party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties confidential
information developed by the receiving party or made known to the receiving party by us during the course of the receiving party s
relationship with us. These agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the receiving party in the course of rendering
services to us will be our exclusive property, and we enter into assignment agreements to perfect our rights. 

These
confidentiality, inventions, and assignment agreements may be breached and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to
us. Our trade secrets also could be independently discovered by competitors, in which case we would not be able to prevent the use of
such trade secrets by our competitors. The enforcement of a claim alleging that a party illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets
could be difficult, expensive, and time consuming and the outcome would be unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States
may be less willing to protect trade secrets. The failure to obtain or maintain meaningful trade secret protection could adversely affect
our competitive position. 

Our
business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow may in the future be negatively impacted by challenging global economic
conditions. 

Future
disruptions and volatility in global financial markets and declining consumer and business confidence could lead to decreased levels
of consumer spending. These macroeconomic developments could negatively impact our business, which depends on the general economic environment
and levels of consumer spending. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our existing customers or attract new customers, or we may
be forced to reduce the price of our products. We are unable to predict the likelihood of the occurrence, duration, or severity of such
disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions. Any general or market-specific economic downturn
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. 

17 

Our
future success depends on our key executive officers and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. 

Our
future success largely depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and management team. If one or more of our executive
officers are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them readily, if at all. Additionally,
we may incur additional expenses to recruit and retain new executive officers. If any of our executive officers joins a competitor or
forms a competing company, we may lose some or all of our customers. Finally, we do not maintain key person life insurance
on any of our executive officers. Because of these factors, the loss of the services of any of these key persons could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and thereby an investment in our stock. 

Our
continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel will also be critical to our success because we will need to hire
and retain additional personnel as our business grows. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified
personnel. We face significant competition for skilled personnel in our industries. In particular, if the marijuana industry continues
to grow, demand for personnel may become more competitive. This competition may make it more difficult and expensive to attract, hire,
and retain qualified managers and employees. Because of these factors, we may not be able to effectively manage or grow our business,
which could adversely affect our financial condition or business. As a result, the value of your investment could be significantly reduced
or completely lost. 

We
may not be able to effectively manage our growth or improve our operational, financial, and management information systems, which would
impair our results of operations. 

In
the near term, we intend to expand the scope of our operations activities significantly. If we are successful in executing our business
plan, we will experience growth in our business that could place a significant strain on our business operations, finances, management,
and other resources. The factors that may place strain on our resources include, but are not limited to, the following: 

The
 need for continued development of our financial and information management systems; 

The
 need to manage strategic relationships and agreements with manufacturers, customers, and partners, and 

Difficulties
 in hiring and retaining skilled management, technical, and other personnel necessary to support and manage our business 

Additionally,
our strategy envisions a period of rapid growth that may impose a significant burden on our administrative and operational resources.
Our ability to effectively manage growth will require us to substantially expand the capabilities of our administrative and operational
resources and to attract, train, manage, and retain qualified management and other personnel. There can be no assurance that we will
be successful in recruiting and retaining new employees or retaining existing employees. 

We
cannot provide assurances that our management will be able to manage this growth effectively. Our failure to successfully manage growth
could result in our sales not increasing commensurately with capital investments or otherwise materially adversely affecting our business,
financial condition, or results of operations. 

If
we are unable to continually innovate and increase efficiencies, our ability to attract new customers may be adversely affected. 

In
the area of innovation, we must be able to develop new technologies and products that appeal to our customers. This depends, in part,
on the technological and creative skills of our personnel and on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We may not
be successful in the development, introduction, marketing, and sourcing of new technologies or innovations, that satisfy customer needs,
achieve market acceptance, or generate satisfactory financial returns. 

We
are dependent on the popularity of consumer acceptance of our current and future product lines. 

Our
ability to generate revenue and be successful in the implementation of our business plan is dependent on consumer acceptance and demand
of our current and future product lines. In the near term, we expect to begin operating a cultivation facility on our 260-acre Farm in
Nevada at which we expect to grow and sell marijuana on a commercial basis. Acceptance of our cannabis products, will depend on several
factors, including availability, cost, ease of use, familiarity of use, convenience, effectiveness, safety, and reliability. If customers
do not accept our products, or if we fail to meet customers needs and expectations adequately, our ability to continue generating
revenues could be reduced. 

18 

A
drop in the retail price of medical marijuana and recreational (adult use) marijuana products may negatively impact our business. 

In
the future, the demand for the marijuana we intend to cultivate will depend in part on the market price of commercially grown marijuana.
Fluctuations in economic and market conditions that impact the prices of commercially grown marijuana, such as increases in the supply
of such marijuana and the decrease in the price of products using commercially grown marijuana, could cause the demand for our marijuana
products to decline, which would have a negative impact on our business. 

Federal
regulation and enforcement may adversely affect the implementation of cannabis laws and regulations may negatively impact our revenues
and profits. 

Currently,
there are 38 states plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulations that recognize, in one form or another, legitimate
medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment, as well as, in some cases, the legalization
of cannabis for adult use. Many other states are considering similar legislation. Conversely, under the CSA, the policies and regulations
of the federal government and its agencies are that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and
the personal use of cannabis is prohibited. Unless and until Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana, as to the timing or scope
of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance, there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current federal law,
and we may be deemed to be producing, cultivating, or dispensing marijuana in violation of federal law. Thus, active enforcement of the
current federal regulatory position on cannabis may indirectly and adversely affect our revenues and profits. The risk of strict enforcement
of the CSA in light of Congressional activity, judicial holdings, and stated federal policy remains uncertain. In February 2017, the
Trump administration announced that there may be greater enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana. Any such enforcement
actions could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. 

On
January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a Marijuana Enforcement Memorandum that rescinded guidance previously issued to
federal law enforcement in a memorandum known as the Cole Memo . The Cole Memo provided that the DOJ is committed to the
enforcement of the CSA, but the DOJ is also committed to using its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most
significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. On April 10, 2019, U.S. Attorney General William Barr, during
testimony before the U.S, Senate Appropriations sub-committee, stated I am accepting the Cole Memorandum for now, but I have generally
left it up to the U.S. Attorneys in each state to determine what the best approach is in that state, A.G. Barr further testified
during the hearing. I haven t heard any complaints from the states that have legalized marijuana. 

The
guidance in the Cole Memo sets forth certain enforcement priorities that are important to the federal government: 

Distribution
 of marijuana to children; 

Revenue
 from the sale of marijuana going to criminals; 

Diversion
 of medical marijuana from states where it is legal to states where it is not; 

Using
 state authorized marijuana activity as a pretext of another illegal drug activity; 

Preventing
 violence in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; 

Preventing
 drugged driving; 

Growing
 marijuana on federal property; and 

Preventing
 possession or use of marijuana on federal property. 

19 

The
DOJ historically has not devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana
for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity. In the event the DOJ reverses
its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana
in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits. Furthermore, H.R. 83, known as
the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment, is a rider to the annual appropriations bill that prohibits the DOJ from using federal funds to prevent
certain states, including Nevada and California, from implementing their own laws that authorized the use, distribution, possession,
or cultivation of medical marijuana. 

On
September 27, 2018, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency announced that drugs, including finished dosage formulations of CBD
with THC below 0.1 , will be considered Schedule 5 drugs as long as the medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 generally referred to as the 2018 Farm Bill included provisions to greatly expand the ability
to grow industrial hemp in the United States and declassified hemp as a Schedule 1 controlled substance under the Controlled Substances
Act. By definition hemp must have a less than .03 concentration of THC or it is then considered marijuana. While the U.S. Department
of Agriculture USDA has primary jurisdiction over the cultivation of industrial hemp, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA continues to have responsibility to regulate cannabis products under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act FD C
Act ). Therefore, any product, including hemp derived products, that make any claims as to the therapeutic benefit of the product
must be approved by the FDA in advance of any sales to the public. 

We
could be found to be violating laws related to cannabis. 

Currently,
there are 38 states plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulations that recognize, in one form or another, legitimate
medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment, as well as, in some cases, the legalization
of cannabis for adult use. Many other states are considering similar legislation. Conversely, under the CSA, the policies and regulations
of the federal government and its agencies are that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and
the personal use of cannabis is prohibited. Unless and until Congress amends the CSA with respect to medical marijuana, as to the timing
or scope of any such amendments there can be no assurance, there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current federal law.
The risk of strict enforcement of the CSA in light of Congressional activity, judicial holdings, and stated federal policy remains uncertain.
With respect to our greenhouse products, we intend to market and sell our greenhouse solutions to marijuana growers. Should it be determined
under the CSA that our greenhouse products or equipment are deemed to fall under the definition of drug paraphernalia because its products
could be determined to be primarily intended or designed for use in manufacturing or producing cannabis, we could be found to be in violation
of federal drug paraphernalia laws and there may be a direct and adverse effect on our business, revenues, and profits. With respect
to Red Earth, we do not currently cultivate, produce, sell, or distribute any marijuana, and, therefore, have no risk that we will be
deemed to cultivate, produce, sell, or distribute any marijuana in violation of federal law. However, if we obtain the necessary final
governmental approvals and permits in Nevada to commence the cultivation and production of marijuana, as to the successfully achievement
of any or all of such objectives there can be no assurance, we could be found in violation of the CSA. This would cause a direct and
adverse effect on our subsidiaries businesses, or intended businesses, and on our revenue and prospective profits. 

Variations
in state and local regulation, and enforcement in states that have legalized cannabis, may restrict marijuana-related activities, including
activities related to medical cannabis, which may negatively impact our revenues and prospective profits. 

Individual
state laws do not always conform to the federal standard or to other states laws. A number of states have decriminalized marijuana to
varying degrees, other states have created exemptions specifically for medical cannabis, and several have both decriminalization and
medical laws. As of the date of this filing, 18 states and the District of Columbia have legalized the recreational use of cannabis.
Variations exist among states that have legalized, decriminalized, or created medical marijuana exemptions. For example, certain states
have limits on the number of marijuana plants that can be homegrown. In most states, the cultivation of marijuana for personal use continues
to be prohibited except for those states that allow small-scale cultivation by the individual in possession of medical marijuana needing
care or that person s caregiver. Active enforcement of state laws that prohibit personal cultivation of marijuana may indirectly
and adversely affect our business and our revenue and profits. 

20 

Prospective
customers may be deterred from doing business with a company with a significant nationwide online presence because of fears of federal
or state enforcement of laws prohibiting possession and sale of medical or recreational marijuana. 

Our
website is visible in jurisdictions where medicinal and/or recreational use of marijuana is not permitted and, as a result, we may be
found to be violating the laws of those jurisdictions. 

Marijuana
remains illegal under federal law. 

Marijuana
is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those 38 states in which the use of marijuana has been
legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law. Since federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana preempts state laws that
legalize its use, strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in our inability to proceed with our business
plan, especially in respect of our marijuana cultivation, production and dispensaries. In addition, our assets, including real property,
cash, equipment, and other goods, could be subject to asset forfeiture because marijuana is still federally illegal. 

In
February 2017, the Trump administration announced that there may be greater enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana.
In January 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded previously issued guidance. Any such enforcement actions or changes in federal
policy or guidance could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. On November 7, 2018, Jeff Sessions resigned
as the Attorney General of the United States. Mr. Sessions was succeeded by William Barr who has publicly stated that he would not prosecute
legal marijuana businesses that rely on the Cole memo. 

In
the future, we will not be able to deduct some of our business expenses. 

Section
280E of the Internal Revenue Code prohibits any business engaged in the trafficking of controlled substances (within the meaning of schedule
I and II of the Controlled Substances Act) from deducting their ordinary and necessary business expenses, which may force us to pay higher
effective federal tax rates than similar companies in other industries. The effective tax rate on a marijuana business depends on how
large its ratio of nondeductible expenses is to its total revenues. Therefore, our marijuana business may be less profitable than it
could otherwise be. 

We
may not be able to attract or retain any independent directors. 

Our
board of directors (the Board is not currently comprised of a majority of independent directors. We may have difficulty
attracting and retaining independent directors because, among other things, we operate in the marijuana industry. 

We
may not be able to successfully execute on our merger and acquisition strategy. 

Our
business plan depends in part on merging with or acquiring other businesses in the marijuana industry. The success of any acquisition
will depend upon, among other things, our ability to integrate acquired personnel, operations, products and technologies into our organization
effectively, to retain and motivate key personnel of acquired businesses, and to retain their customers. Any acquisition may result in
diversion of management s attention from other business concerns, and such acquisition may be dilutive to our financial results
and/or result in impairment charges and write-offs. We might also spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition
or investment targets, but not complete the transaction. 

Although
we expect to realize strategic, operational, and financial benefits as a result of our acquisitions, we cannot predict whether and to
what extent such benefits will be achieved. There are significant challenges to integrating an acquired operation into our business. 

Any
future acquisition could involve other risks, including the assumption of unidentified liabilities for which we, as a successor owner,
may be responsible. These transactions typically involve a number of risks and present financial and other challenges, including the
existence of unknown disputes, liabilities, or contingencies and changes in the industry, location, or regulatory or political environment
in which these investments are located, that our due diligence review may not adequately uncover and that may arise after entering into
such arrangements. 

21 

Laws
and regulations affecting the medical and adult use marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our
proposed cultivation and production operations and greenhouse products. 

Local,
state, and federal medical and adult use marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which
could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter certain aspects of our business plan. In addition, violations
of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt certain aspects of our business plan and result in a material adverse
effect on certain aspects of our planned operations. In addition, it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will
be directly applicable to certain aspects of our proposed cultivation and production businesses, as well as our greenhouse solutions
business. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect
additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business. 

We
may not obtain the necessary permits and authorizations to operate our proposed marijuana business. 

We
may not be able to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses, permits, authorizations, or accreditations for our proposed cultivation
and production businesses and greenhouse solutions business, or may only be able to do so at great cost. In addition, we may not be able
to comply fully with the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to the medical and adult use marijuana industry. Failure to
comply with or to obtain the necessary licenses, permits, authorizations, or accreditations could result in restrictions on our ability
to operate the medical and adult use marijuana business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

If
we incur substantial liability from litigation, complaints, or enforcement actions, our financial condition could suffer. 

Our
participation in the medical and adult use marijuana industry may lead to litigation, formal or informal complaints, enforcement actions,
and inquiries by various federal, state, or local governmental authorities against us. Litigation, complaints, and enforcement actions
could consume considerable amounts of financial and other corporate resources, which could have a negative impact on our sales, revenue,
profitability, and growth prospects. We have not been, and are not currently, subject to any material litigation, complaint, or enforcement
action regarding marijuana (or otherwise) brought by any federal, state, or local governmental authority. Certain of our operating subsidiaries,
may in the future engage in the distribution of marijuana; however, we have not been, and are not currently, subject to any material
litigation, complaint, or enforcement action regarding marijuana (or otherwise) brought by any federal, state, or local governmental
authority with respect to the business of any our subsidiaries. 

We
may have difficulty accessing the service of banks, which may make it difficult for us to operate. 

Since
the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, many banks will not except for deposit funds from businesses involved with the marijuana
industry. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry often have difficulty finding a bank willing to accept their business.
The inability to open or maintain bank accounts may make it difficult for us to operate our proposed marijuana businesses. If any of
our bank accounts are closed, we may have difficulty processing transactions in the ordinary course of business, including paying suppliers,
employees and landlords, which could have a significant negative effect on our operations. In March of this year, U.S. Congressman Ed
Perlmutter (D Colorado) introduced house bill H.R. 1595, known as the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act to allow
legally operating cannabis related businesses to utilize traditional banking services without fear of federal agencies taking legal action
against the banks or their customers. On September 25, 2019, the SAFE bill was passed with strong bipartisan support in the House of
Representatives. Many industry observers anticipate that the bill will be signed into law within the next year. 

22 

Litigation
may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

From
time to time in the normal course of our business operations, we may become subject to litigation that may result in liability material
to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required.
The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require a diversion of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity
associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are
valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. Insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities
with respect to these or other matters. A judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could adversely
affect our business and the results of our operations. 

Our
officers and directors have substantial equity ownership in the Company and substantial control over certain corporate actions. 

As
of December 31, 2022, our officers and directors owned approximately 26 of our outstanding Common Stock and thus exercise substantial
control over stockholder matters, such as election of directors, amendments to the Articles of Incorporation, and approval of significant
corporate transactions. 

If
we fail to implement and maintain proper and effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements and public reports could be impaired,
which could adversely affect our operating results, our ability to operate our business, and investors views of us. 

Our
internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of U.S. GAAP rules. Our internal controls
were adversely affected by deficiencies in the design or operation of our internal controls, which management considered to be material
weaknesses. These material weaknesses include the following: 

lack
 of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board, resulting in ineffective oversight
 in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; 

inadequate
 segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; 

ineffective
 controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes; 

beginning
 in July of 2019 the Company s executive management team began convening weekly meetings to review expenditures and provide
 cash flow analysis, and 

the
 Company intends to add additional external accounting support. On October 1, 2019, the Company established an audit committee which
 is chaired by Roger Bloss, the Company s Interim Chief Executive Officer and a Director of the Company and established a compensation
 committee which is chaired by Paris Balaouras, the Company s Chief Cultivation Officer and a Director of the Company. 

The
failure to implement and maintain proper and effective internal controls and disclosure controls could result in material weaknesses
in our financial reporting, such as errors in our financial statements and in the accompanying footnote disclosures that could require
restatements. Investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and disclosure, which could negatively impact our stock
price. 

We
do not expect that our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will
be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two
or more people, or by management override of the controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or
deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

23 

Our
insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures. 

We
will be exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products we provide. While we intend to maintain insurance for certain risks, the
amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs
resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business. It is also not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational
risks and liabilities. In particular, we may have difficulty obtaining insurance because we intend to operate in the marijuana industry.
The failure to obtain adequate insurance coverage on terms favorable to us, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. We do not have any business interruption insurance. Any business disruption or natural
disaster could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. 

If
our products are contaminated, we may have litigation and products liability exposure. 

We
source some of our products from third-party suppliers. Although we are required by Nevada law to test the products we receive from third-party
suppliers, we may not identify all contamination in those products. Possible contaminates include pesticides, molds, and fungus. If a
customer suffers an injury from our products, they may sue us in addition to the supplier and we may not have adequate insurance to cover
any such claims, which could result in a negative effect on our results of operations. 

Some
of our lines of business rely on our third-party service providers to host and deliver services and data, and any interruptions or delays
in these hosted services, security or privacy breaches, or failures in data collection could expose us to liability and harm our business
and reputation. 

Some
of our lines of business and services rely on services hosted and controlled directly by third-party service providers. We do not have
redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers and our disaster recovery
planning may not account for all eventualities. If our business relationship with a third-party provider of hosting or software services
is negatively affected, or if one of our service providers were to terminate its agreement with us, we might not be able to deliver access
our data, which could subject us to reputational harm and cause us to lose customers and future business, thereby reducing our revenue. 

We
may hold large amounts of customer data, some of which will likely be hosted in third-party facilities. A security incident at those
facilities or ours may compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of customer data. Unauthorized access to customer data
stored on our computers or networks may be obtained through break-ins, breaches of our secure network by an unauthorized party, employee
theft or misuse or other misconduct. It is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate
use of security controls by customers. Accounts created with weak passwords could allow cyber-attackers to gain access to customer data.
If there were an inadvertent disclosure of customer information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the information
we possess on behalf of our customers, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation could be damaged, and we could be subject to
claims or other liabilities. In addition, such perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of the information we collect, or breach of
our security could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customers and harm our business. 

Because
of the data we expect to collect and manage using our hosted solutions, it is possible that hardware or software failures or errors in
our systems (or those of our third-party service providers) could result in data loss or corruption, cause the information that we collect
to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant or cause us to fail to meet committed service levels.
Furthermore, our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including access to the Internet,
the failure of our network or software systems or security breaches. In addition, computer viruses or other malware may harm our systems,
causing us to lose data, and the transmission of computer viruses or other malware could expose us to litigation. We may also find, on
occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports in near real time because of a number of factors, including failures of our network
or software. If we supply inaccurate information or experience interruptions in our ability to capture, store and supply information
in near real time or at all, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose customers, or we could be found liable for damages or incur
other losses. Moreover, states in which we operate may require that we maintain certain information about our customers and transactions.
If we fail to maintain such information, we could be in violation of state laws. 

Our
business operations have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of the novel respiratory illness
coronavirus COVID-19 ). 

On
March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel respiratory illness COVID-19 a pandemic. The new strain
of COVID-19 is considered to be highly contagious and poses a serious public health threat. 

Any
outbreak of such epidemic illness or other adverse public health developments may materially and adversely affect the global economy,
our markets and our business. In the first two quarters of 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused disruptions in our grow operations,
which have resulted in delays in the shipment of products to certain of our customers and ultimately, a suspension of our operations.
A prolonged disruption or any further unforeseen delay in our operations of the growing and delivery process within any of our facilities
could continue to result in delays in the shipment of products to our customers, increased costs and reduced revenue. 

We
cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact.
If the outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled, our business operations and financial condition may be materially
and adversely affected as a result of the deteriorating market outlook for sales, the slowdown in regional and national economic growth,
weakened liquidity and financial condition of our customers or other factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors
beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties in the regions where we conduct
business, cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

24 

We
face potential business disruptions and related risks resulting from the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In
December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. The COVID-19 outbreak has grown
into a global pandemic that has impacted Asia, United States, Europe and other countries throughout the world. Financial markets have
been experiencing extreme fluctuations that may cause a contraction in available liquidity globally as important segments of the credit
markets react to the development. The pandemic may lead to a decline in business and consumer confidence. The global outbreak of COVID-19
continues to rapidly evolve. As a result, businesses have closed and limits have been placed on travel. The extent to which COVID-19
may impact our business, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and
social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions
taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease. 

We
are monitoring the potential impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, and if COVID-19 continues to spread globally, including in the United States,
we may experience disruptions that could severely impact the Company s grow opportunities along with sales, including: 

the
 pandemic has reduced foot traffic in the stores where our products are sold that remain open, and the global economic impact of the
 pandemic has reduced consumer demand for our products generally; 

the
 uncertainty that our contractors, suppliers, and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for
 an unknown period of time; 

the
 impact of social distancing at commercial and retail facilities; 

delays
 in receiving approval from local regulatory authorities in the completion of the Company s Tiny Home community; 

the
 pandemic has reduced foot traffic in the stores where our products are sold that remain open, and the global economic impact of the
 pandemic has reduced consumer demand for our products generally; and 

the
 majority of our retail customers have been unable to sell our products in their stores due to government-mandated closures and have
 temporarily reduced orders for our products; 

Quarantines,
shelter-in-place and similar government orders, or the perception that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of
business operations could occur, related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases could impact personnel at third-party suppliers in
the United States and other countries, or the availability or cost of materials, which would disrupt our supply chain. Any manufacturing
supply interruption of materials could adversely affect our ability to conduct ongoing and future research and testing activities. 

The
spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, may materially affect us economically. While the potential economic impact
brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption
of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition,
a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common
stock. 

25 

Risks
Related to an Investment in Our Securities 

We
expect to experience volatility in the price of our Common Stock, which could negatively affect stockholders investments. 

The
trading price of our Common Stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some
of which are beyond our control. The stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been
unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies with securities traded in those markets. Broad market and industry
factors may seriously affect the market price of companies stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance.
All of these factors could adversely affect your ability to sell your shares of Common Stock or, if you are able to sell your shares,
to sell your shares at a price that you determine to be fair or favorable. 

Our
Common Stock is categorized as penny stock, which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares of Common
Stock due to suitability requirements. 

Our
Common Stock is categorized as penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9, which generally defines penny stock 
to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per
share, subject to certain exceptions. The price of our Common Stock is significantly less than 5.00 per share and, therefore, is considered
 penny stock. This designation imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other
than established customers and accredited investors. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer buying our securities to disclose
certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably
suitable to purchase the securities given the increased risks generally inherent in penny stocks. These rules may restrict the ability
and/or willingness of brokers or dealers to buy or sell our Common Stock, either directly or on behalf of their clients, may discourage
potential stockholders from purchasing our Common Stock, or may adversely affect the ability of stockholders to sell their shares. 

Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder s ability to buy and
sell our Common Stock, which could depress the price of our Common Stock. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require a broker-dealer to have reasonable
grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer before recommending an investment to a customer. Prior to recommending
speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information
about the customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives, and other information. Under interpretations of these
rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some
customers. Thus, the FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our Common Stock,
which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares of Common Stock, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares of Common
Stock, and thereby depress our price per share of Common Stock. 

Our
Common Stock may not be eligible for listing or quotation on any national securities exchange. 

We
do not currently meet the initial quantitative listing standards of any national securities exchange. We cannot assure you that we will
be able to meet the initial listing standards of any national securities exchange in the future, or, if we do meet such initial listing
standards, that we will be able to maintain any such listing. Until our Common Stock is listed on a national securities exchange, which
event may never occur, we expect that it will continue to be eligible and quoted on the OTC Markets Pink Marketplace. However,
investors may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our Common Stock. Further, the national securities
exchanges are adopting so-called seasoning rules that will require that we meet certain requirements, including prescribed
periods of time trading over the counter and minimum filings of periodic reports with the SEC, before we are eligible to apply for listing
on such national securities exchanges. In addition, if we fail to meet the criteria set forth in SEC regulations, various requirements
would be imposed by law on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors.
Consequently, such regulations may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our Common Stock, which may further affect its liquidity.
This would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. 

26 

The
elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers, and employees under Nevada law and the existence of indemnification
rights for our obligations to our directors, officers, and employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage
lawsuits against our directors, officers, and employees. 

Our
Articles of Incorporation contain a provision permitting us to eliminate the personal liability of our directors to us and our stockholders
for damages for the breach of a fiduciary duty as a director or officer to the extent provided by Nevada law. We may also have contractual
indemnification obligations under any future employment agreements with our officers or agreements entered into with our directors. The
foregoing indemnification obligations could result in us incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage
awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and the resulting costs may also discourage
us from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing
of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise
benefit us and our stockholders. 

We
may issue additional shares of Common Stock or preferred stock in the future, which could cause significant dilution to all stockholders. 

Our
Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 95,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock,
with a par value of 0.001 per share. As of December 31, 2022, we had 78,591,667 shares of Common Stock and 0 shares of Preferred Stock,
outstanding; however, we may issue additional shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock in the future in connection with a financing
or an acquisition. Such issuances may not require the approval of our stockholders. Any issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock,
or equity securities convertible into our Common Stock, including but not limited to, Preferred Stock, warrants, and options, will dilute
the percentage ownership interest of all stockholders, may dilute the book value per share of our Common Stock, and may negatively impact
the market price of our Common Stock. 

Anti-takeover
effects of certain provisions of Nevada state law hinder a potential takeover of us. 

Nevada
has a business combination law that prohibits certain business combinations between Nevada corporations and interested stockholders 
for three years after an interested stockholder first becomes an interested stockholder, unless the corporation s
board of directors approves the combination in advance. For purposes of Nevada law, an interested stockholder is any person
who is (i) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares
of the corporation or (ii) an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the three previous years was the beneficial
owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition
of the term business combination is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential
acquirer to use the corporation s assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests
of the corporation and its other stockholders. 

The
effect of Nevada s business combination law is potentially to discourage parties interested in taking control of us from doing
so if they cannot obtain the approval of our Board. Both of these provisions could limit the price investors would be willing to pay
in the future for shares of our Common Stock. 

Because
we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our Common Stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares
unless they sell them. 

We
intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends
on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Declaring and paying future dividends, if any, will be determined by our Board, based
upon earnings, financial condition, capital resources, capital requirements, restrictions in our Articles of Incorporation, contractual
restrictions, and such other factors as our Board deems relevant. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive
a return on their shares unless they sell them. There is no assurance that stockholders will be able to sell shares when desired or for
prices that they deem acceptable.

The
Company s principal office is located at 5730 Sky Pointe Dr. Suite 102, Las Vegas, NV 89130. In January 2021, the Company sold
its commercial office building located at 1300 South Jones Boulevard, Las Vegas, NV 89146. 

The
Company held a triple net leasehold interest, through its former subsidiary Red Earth LLC Red Earth ), in a 17,298 square
foot building located at 2310 Western Avenue, Las Vegas, Nevada (the Western lease ). The lease was for an initial term
of 10 years, with a 12-month rent abatement. The commencement date of the lease was June 29, 2017. The lease included two options to
extend, each for an additional 5 years. The lease granted the Company an option to purchase the property on or after the 25 th month
of the lease and continuing through the 60 th month of the lease for the sum of 2,607,880. On August 26, 2021, the Company
and the Company s Chief Cultivation Officer and previous owner of Red Earth, Paris Balaouras, entered into a Termination Agreement.
Under the terms of the Termination Agreement, the Purchase Agreement, dated December 15, 2017, entered into between the Company and Red
Earth was terminated as of the date of the Termination Agreement resulting in the return of ownership of Red Earth to Mr. Balaouras.
As such, the Company no longer holds any interest in the Western lease. 

In
August of 2018, the Company executed a letter of intent LOI for the acquisition of all of the membership units of Farm
Road, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company Farm Road ). Farm Road is the owner of five parcels of farmland in the Amargosa
Valley of Nevada totaling 260 acres and the concomitant 180 acre-feet of water rights. The total purchase price for the acquisition of
Farm Road was One million dollars 1,000,000), as follows: a deposit of 50,000 in cash and 50,000 of the Company s restricted
common stock upon execution of the LOI, to be held in escrow until closing, 150,000 in cash payable at closing and a promissory note

Effective
August 1, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to lease an approximately 17,000 sq. ft. commercial building in Pahrump, NV. The
lease is for a term of ten years at an initial monthly rent of 10,000 per month with rent increases each August 1 st during
the term of the lease equal to the Consumer Price Index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor for CPI W (Urban
Wage Earners and Clerical Workers) for Las Vegas, Nevada. The Company paid the property owner a security deposit in the amount of 20,000.
While the Company took possession of the premises on August 1, 2019, the monthly rent commenced on October 1, 2019. The Company has an
option, exercisable between July 1, 2020 and July 1, 2024, to purchase the property for 1,800,000. The leasehold has previously been
utilized as a fully licensed State of Nevada marijuana cultivation facility. On November 29, 2019, the building suffered significant
damage after a windstorm swept through the town of Pahrump. The storm caused structural damage as well as damage to the plumbing and
electrical supply to the building, making the facility unusable. Pursuant to the terms of the lease, the inability to occupy and utilize
the facility relieves us of any obligation to pay rent. As of the date of this filing, repairs to the building have not yet commenced.
It was the Company s intention to move its marijuana processing into this facility upon receipt of all required regulatory approvals.
The Company has no intention of occupying the leased space. 

Item
3. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, the Company may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
When the Company is aware of a claim or potential claim, it assesses the likelihood of any loss or exposure. If it is probable that a
loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company will record a liability for the loss. In addition
to the estimated loss, the liability includes probable and estimable legal cost associated with the claim or potential claim. Litigation
is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm the Company
business.

Tierney
Arbitration 

On March 9, 2021, Terrence Tierney Claimant ), the Company s
former President and Secretary, who was terminated by the Company for Cause on August 7, 2020, filed for arbitration with the American
Arbitration Association for: (i) breach of contract, (i) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and (iii) NRS
608 wage claim. Mr. Tierney demanded payment in the amount of 501,085 for unpaid base pay and unpaid deferred business compensation (which
was not earned nor due), expenses paid on behalf of the Company, accrued vacation and severance pay. On April 7, 2021, the Company made
payment of unpaid base pay against the wage claim in the amount of 62,392, inclusive of 59,583 for wages and 2,854 for accrued vacation
plus 8,307.60 for statutory penalties. As such, the Company posits that any compensation claims that Claimant may have had have been
paid in full and that the Company otherwise has no liability. The Company filed a counterclaim in the action declaring that Tierney breached
the contract of employment, committed fraud, malfeasance and other nefarious acts causing substantial damage to the Company with estimated
monetary damages well in excess of any monetary claim made by Tierney. On May 4, 2022, the Arbitrator issued a ruling concluding that
the Arbitrator did not have jurisdiction over Claimant s statutory wage claim under NRS 608. On September 19, 2022, Claimant filed
a complaint in state court seeking compensation under NRS 608.020. The Company asserts that the 2-year statute of limitations bars Claimant s
complaint, and further asserts that Claimant has been paid in full pursuant to the payments issued to Claimant on April 7, 2021. The arbitration
proceeded to trial on January 9-12, 2023 and the Arbitrator issued her award on March 7, 2023, awarding Claimant 401,360.61 in damages,
offset by 350,000.00 awarded to the Company for its counter-claims, with a net damage award to Claimant in the sum of 51,360.61.

The
following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with
the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. 

Company
Background 

MJ
Holdings, Inc. (OTCPK: MJNE) is a highly-diversified holding company providing cultivation management, asset and infrastructure development
 currently concentrated in the Las Vegas market. It is the Company s intention to grow its business and provide a 360-degree
spectrum of infrastructure, including, cannabis cultivation, production of cannabis related products, management services, dispensaries
and consulting services. The Company intends to grow its business through joint ventures with existing companies possessing complementary
subject matter expertise, acquisition of existing companies and through the development of new opportunities. The Company intends to
 prove the concept profitably in the rapidly expanding Las Vegas market and then use that anticipated success as a template
for replicating the concept in other developing states through a combination of strategic partnerships, acquisitions and opening new
operations. 

The
Company was incorporated on November 17, 2006, as Securitas EDGAR Filings, Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada. Prior to the formation
of Securitas EDGAR Filings Inc., the business was operated as Xpedient EDGAR Filings, LLC, a Florida Limited Liability Company, formed
on October 31, 2005. On November 21, 2005, Xpedient EDGAR Filings LLC amended its Articles of Organization to change its name to Securitas
EDGAR Filings, LLC. On January 21, 2009, Securitas EDGAR Filings LLC merged into Securitas EDGAR Filings, Inc., a Nevada corporation.
On February 14, 2014, the Company amended and restated its Articles of Incorporation and changed its name to MJ Holdings, Inc. 

On
November 22, 2016, in connection with a plan to divest the Company of its real estate business, the Company submitted to its stockholders
an offer to exchange (the Exchange Offer its common stock for shares in MJ Real Estate Partners, LLC, MJRE a newly-formed LLC formed for the sole purpose of effecting the Exchange Offer. On January 10, 2017, the Company accepted for exchange
1,800,000 shares of its Common Stock in exchange for 1,800,000 shares of MJRE s common units, representing membership interests
in MJRE. Effective February 1, 2017, the Company transferred its ownership interests in the real estate properties and its subsidiaries,
through which the Company held ownership of the real estate properties, to MJRE. MJRE also assumed the senior notes and any and all obligations
associated with the real estate properties and business, effective February 1, 2017. 

Operational
highlights: 

260
 acres of farmland for the purpose of cultivating additional marijuana (the 260 Acres purchased in January of 2019.
 The Company intends to utilize the state-of-the-art Cravo cultivation system for growing an additional five acres of
 marijuana on this property. The Cravo system will allow multiple harvests per year and should result in higher annual
 yields per acre. The land has more than 180-acre feet of permitted water rights, which will provide more than sufficient water to
 markedly increase the Company s marijuana cultivation capabilities. This facility, upon receipt of its business license in
 Nye County and its final inspection by the Cannabis Compliance Board CCB ), is expected to become operational in the
 summer of 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company elected to relocate all of its equipment utilized on the Acres
 lease to its 260 Acres adjacent to the Acres lease. The Company will utilize the 260 Acres for its own harvest along with additional
 harvests under any Cultivation and Sales Agreements. 

Cultivation
 and Sales Agreements entered into for multiple grows on the Company s 260 Acres located in the Amargosa Valley of Nevada.
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into separate Cultivation and Sales Agreements, whereby the
 Company shall retain certain independent growers to provide oversight and management of the Company s cultivation and sale
 of products at its 260 Acres. The independent growers shall pay to the Company a royalty of net sales revenue with a minimum royalty
 after two years. As of the date of this filing, the Company is waiting on its business license in Nye County and its final inspection
 by the Cannabis Compliance Board before it can commence its operations under the Agreement. 

a
 nearby commercial trailer and RV park (THC Park Tiny Home Community) was purchased in April of 2019 to supply necessary
 housing for the Company s farm employees. After the Company s 2018 harvest, it came to realize that it would need to
 find a more efficient method of housing and to bring its cultivation team to its facilities. The Company purchased the 50-acre plus
 THC Park for 600,000 in cash and 50,000 of the Company s restricted common stock. At present, the Company s construction
 and completion of this community is approximately seventy-five present complete. The impact of COVID-19 in obtaining inspections
 and permitting has significantly delayed the completion of this community. The Company has elected to cease any renovations or additions at its Tiny
Home Community but will continue to rent out those units that have been leased. 

31 

an
 agreement to acquire a cultivation license and production license, both currently located in Nye County Nevada. On February 5, 2021, the Company
(the Purchaser executed a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement MIPA3 with MJ Distributing, Inc. (the
 Seller to acquire all of the outstanding membership interests of MJ Distributing C202, LLC and MJ Distributing P133, LLC,
each the holder of a State of Nevada provisional medical and recreational cultivation license and a provisional medical and recreational
production license. In consideration of the sale, transfer, assignment and delivery of the Membership Interests to Purchaser, and the
covenants made by Seller under the MIPA3, Purchaser agreed to pay a combination of cash, promissory notes, and stock in the amount of
One-Million-Two-Hundred-Fifty Thousand Dollars 1,250,000.00) in cash and/or promissory notes and 200,000 shares of the Company s
restricted common stock, all of which constitutes the consideration agreed to herein for (the Purchase Price ), payable
as follows: (i) a non-refundable down payment in the amount of 300,000 was made on January 15, 2021, (ii) the second payment in the amount
of 200,000 was made on February 5, 2021, (iii) a deposit in the amount of 310,000 was paid on February 22, 2021 210,000 was a pre-payment
against future compensation due under the MIPA3), (iv) 200,000 was deposited on June 24, 2021, (v) 200,000 shall be deposited on or
before June 12, 2021, and (vi) 250,000 shall be deposited within five (5) business days after the CCB provides notice on its agenda that
the Licenses are set for hearing to approve the transfer of ownership from the Seller to the Purchaser. On April 12, 2022, the CCB issued
an Adult-Use Production License to MJ Distributing P133, LLC and an Adult-Use Cultivation License to MJ Distributing C202, LLC. The Company
is currently awaiting the transfer approval from the CCB. 

The
Company may also continue to seek to identify potential acquisitions of revenue producing assets and licenses within legalized cannabis
markets that can maximize shareholder value. 

The
Company may face substantial competition in the operation of cultivation facilities in Nevada. Numerous other companies have also been
granted cultivation licenses, and, therefore, the Company anticipates that it will face competition from these other companies. The Company s
management team has experience in successfully developing, implementing, and operating marijuana cultivation and related businesses in
other legal cannabis markets. The Company believes its experience in outdoor cultivation provides it with a distinct competitive advantage
over its competitors and it will continue to focus on this area of its operations. 

32 

Acquisition
of Red Earth 

On
December 15, 2017, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Red Earth, LLC, a Nevada limited liability
company Red Earth established in October 2016, in exchange for 52,732,969 shares of its Common Stock and a promissory
note in the amount of 900,000. The acquisition was accounted for as a Reverse Merger , whereby Red Earth was considered
the accounting acquirer and became its wholly owned subsidiary. Upon the consummation of the acquisition, the now former members of Red
Earth became the beneficial owners of approximately 88 of the Company s Common Stock, obtained controlling interest of the Company,
and retained certain of its key management positions. In accordance with the accounting treatment for a reverse merger 
or a reverse acquisition , the Company s historical financial statements prior to the reverse merger will be replaced
with the historical financial statements of Red Earth prior to the reverse merger in all future filings with the SEC. Red Earth is the
holder of a Nevada Marijuana Establishment Certificate for the cultivation of marijuana. 

On
or about May 7, 2021, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, Red Earth, LLC (the Subsidiary ), received an inquiry
from the State of Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board CCB regarding the transfer of ownership of the Subsidiary from its
previous owners to the Company. The CCB has determined that the transfer was not formally approved, thus a Category II violation. 

The
consolidated financial statements after completion of the reverse merger included: the assets, liabilities, and results of operations
of the combined company from and after the closing date of the reverse merger, with only certain aspects of pre-consummation stockholders 
equity remaining in the consolidated financial statements. In February of 2019, the Company repurchased, from the Company s largest
shareholder, 20,000,000 of the 26,366,484 shares of common stock that this shareholder originally received in connection with the Reverse
Merger - for a total purchase price of 20,000. 

On
July 27, 2021, the Subsidiary entered into a Stipulation and Order for Settlement of Disciplinary Action (the Stipulation Order with the CCB. Under the terms of the Stipulation Order, the Subsidiary has agreed to present to the CCB, by not later than August 31,
2021, a plan pursuant to which the ownership of the Subsidiary will be returned to the original owners. The Parties to the Stipulation
Order resolved the matter without the necessity of taking formal action. The Subsidiary agreed to pay a civil penalty of 10,000, which
was paid on July 29, 2021. 

On
August 1, 2021, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding and Agreement for Technical Services and Short-Term Funding (the
 Agreement with Red Earth, LLC (hereinafter, Red Earth ), an entity controlled by its Chief Cultivation Officer,
Paris Balaouras. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company will provide a short-term loan (the Loan to Red Earth for
expenses related to the activation and operation of Red Earth s cultivation license. The Loan shall bear interest at 12 per annum
and increase to 18 upon default. In addition, the Company shall provide Red Earth pre-opening technical services at a cost of 5,000
to 10,000 per month. As of December 31, 2022, the amount due the Company under the short-term loan is 212,469 and the amount of technical services income (misc. income) recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 100,000. 

On
August 26, 2021, the Company and the Company s Chief Cultivation Officer and previous owner of Red Earth, Paris Balaouras, entered
into a Termination Agreement. Under the terms of the Termination Agreement, the Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ),
dated December 15, 2017, entered into between the Company and Red Earth was terminated as of the date of the Termination Agreement resulting
in the return of ownership of Red Earth to Mr. Balaouras. Neither party shall have any further obligation to one another pursuant to
the terms of the Purchase Agreement. On September 2, 2021, the Company received approval of the Termination Agreement from the CCB. Please
 see Note 8 Intangible Assets and Note 17 Gain on Disposal of Subsidiary for further information.

Critical
Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates 

The
Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ). The preparation
of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases
its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

An
accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that
are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in
the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. The Company
believes that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation
of the consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue
Recognition 

On
January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers using the modified retrospective method. Since the Company had not previously recognized any revenue there was no impact
upon adoption of ASC 606 on its consolidated financial statements. The new revenue standard was applied prospectively in the Company s
consolidated financial statements from January 1, 2018 forward and reported financial information for historical comparable periods will
not be revised and will continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect during those historical periods. Revenues are
recognized when control of the promised goods or performance obligations for services is transferred to the Company s customers,
in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services. 

34 

Income
Taxes 

Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
A valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is established when management considers it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

Tax
benefits from an uncertain tax position are only recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements
from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon
ultimate resolution. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as incurred as a component of income tax
expense. The Company has not recognized any tax benefits from uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented.

 In
 April 2018, the Company entered into a management agreement with Acres Cultivation, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (the
 Licensed Operator that holds a license for the legal cultivation of marijuana for sale under the laws of the State
 of Nevada. In January of 2019, the Company entered into a revised agreement, which replaced the April 2018 agreement, with the Licensed
 Operator in order to be more stringently aligned with Nevada marijuana laws. The material terms of the agreement remain unchanged.
 The Licensed Operator is contractually obligated to pay over to the Company eighty-five (85 percent of gross revenues defined as
 gross proceeds from sales of marijuana products minus applicable state excise taxes and local sales tax. The agreement is to remain
 in force until April 2026. In April 2019, the Licensed Operator was acquired by Curaleaf Holdings, Inc., a publicly traded Canadian
 cannabis company. On January 21, 2021, the Company received a Notice of Termination, effective immediately, from Acres Cultivation,
 LLC. The Company does not anticipate that it will generate any further revenue under the Acres relationship. The Company will not
 generate any further revenue under the Acres relationship.

 Product
 sales from Company inventory. As part of the termination of the Acres Cultivation, LLC Cultivation and Sales Agreement, the Company
 was given cannabis available for resale. Sales in 2021 include product sold to third parties and product given in exchange for rent.
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the lack of revenue from product sales is largely attributable to a complaint filed by the
 Company against one of its third-party storage facilities. Please see Note 4 Inventory for further
 information. 

(iv) 
 On
 July 11, 2022, the Company purchased MJH Research, Inc. MJH through a stock exchange agreement. MJH is a Florida
 corporation whose operations center around providing consulting services for growing techniques, management and cultivation of crops,
 as well as licensing support, production and asset and infrastructure development. 

Operating
Expenses 

Direct cost of revenue was 0 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared
to 341,626 for the year ending December 31, 2021, resulting in a decrease of 341,626. The decrease was largely attributable to the decrease
in product sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to the litigation with one of the Company s storage facilities.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2022. Based
upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer concluded that its disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022. 

Evaluation
of Internal Controls and Procedures 

The
Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined by
Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Its internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of its
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Internal
control over financial reporting has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, the Company has evaluated
the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as required by Securities Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(c). In making its assessment, the Company has utilized the criteria set forth by the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company concluded that based on its evaluation, the
Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022. 

37 

In
connection with the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, due to
resource constraints, material weaknesses became evident to management regarding its inability to generate all the necessary disclosures
for inclusion in its filings with the Securities and Exchanges Commission due to the lack of resources and segregation of duties. The
Company lacked sufficient personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in GAAP to meet the demands for
a public company, including the accounting skills and understanding necessary to fulfill the requirements of GAAP-based reporting. This
weakness causes it to not fully identify and resolve accounting and disclosure issues that could lead to a failure to perform timely
internal control and reviews. In addition, the Company does not have any independent outside director on the Company s Board of
Directors and lacks documentation of its internal control processes. The Company intends to add additional external accounting support.
During 2019, the Company established an audit committee and compensation committee. 

The
Company is neither an accelerated filer nor a large-accelerated filer, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, and there is
not otherwise included in this Annual Report an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not required to be attested by the Company s registered
public accounting firm pursuant to Item 308(b) of Regulation S-K. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December
31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
During 2023, as its business operations expand, the Company plans to hire additional employees and engage outside professionals to address
the material weaknesses identified above.

the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements referred

Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit
included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

Going
Concern

from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion

laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Revenue
Recognition Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements. 

Description
of the Critical Audit Matter 

The
Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. As this is the first year that the Company has earned revenue,
we considered this to be a critical audit matter due to judgments required by management regarding revenue recognition. 

How
the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

Our
principal audit procedures related to revenue recognition included the following, among others: 

Evaluated
 management s revenue recognition policies and reviewed underlying documents for reasonableness
 of the application of ASC 606. 
 
 Obtained
 an understanding of the process utilized by management in determining when performance obligations
 are satisfied. 
 
 Substantively
 tested revenue transactions to an appropriate coverage based on risk assessments. 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Level
1: The preferred inputs to valuation efforts are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, 
with the caveat that the reporting entity must have access to that market. Information at this level is based on direct observations
of transactions involving the same assets and liabilities, not assumptions, and thus offers superior reliability. However, relatively
few items, especially physical assets, actually trade in active markets. 

Level
2 : FASB acknowledged that active markets for identical assets and liabilities are relatively uncommon and, even when they do exist,
they may be too thin to provide reliable information. To deal with this shortage of direct data, the board provided a second level of
inputs that can be applied in these situations. 

Level
3: If inputs from levels 1 and 2 are not available, FASB acknowledges that fair value measures of many assets and liabilities are less
precise. The board describes Level 3 inputs as unobservable, and limits their use by saying they shall be used to

Step
2 Identify Performance Obligations in the Contract Upon execution of a contract, the Company identifies as performance
obligations each promise to transfer to the customer either (a) goods or services that are distinct, or (b) a series of distinct goods
or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. To the extent a contract includes
multiple promised goods or services, the Company must apply judgement to determine whether the goods or services are capable of being
distinct within the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance
obligation. 

Step
3 Determine the Transaction Price When (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, the Company shall recognize as
revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the performance obligation. The contract terms are used to determine
the transaction price. Generally, all contracts include fixed consideration. If a contract did include variable consideration, the Company
would determine the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price based on expected value method.
Variable consideration would be included in the transaction price, if in the Company s judgement, it is probable that a significant
future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract would not occur. 

Step
4 Allocate the Transaction Price After the transaction price has been determined, the next step is to allocate the transaction
price to each performance obligation in the contract. If the contract only has one performance obligation, the entire transaction price
will be applied to that obligation. If the contract has multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the performance
obligations based on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) at contract inception. 

Step
5 Satisfaction of the Performance Obligations (and Recognize Revenue) Revenue is recognized when (or as) goods or services
are transferred to a customer. The Company satisfies each of its performance obligations by transferring control of the promised good
or service underlying that performance obligation to the customer. Control is the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially
all of the remaining benefits from an asset. It includes the ability to prevent other entities from directing the use of and obtaining
the benefits from an asset. Indicators that control has passed to the customer include: a present obligation to pay; physical possession
of the asset; legal title; risks and rewards of ownership; and acceptance of the asset(s). Performance obligations can be satisfied at
a point in time or overtime. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, the majority of the Company s revenue was derived from its newly acquired subsidiary, MJH Research,
Inc. through a services contract. The revenue was recognized at the time the services were provided. The Company s remaining revenue
is derived from its rental property in Nye County, Nevada. The Revenue created from the rental revenue is completely derived from short
term operating leases and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Rental revenue recognition commences when
the leased space is available for use by the lessee. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2021, t he majority of the Company s revenue was derived under
the agreements, Consulting Agreement and Equipment Lease Agreement, entered into with Acres Cultivation, LLC. Revenue derived from consulting
services fees are recognized over the term of the arrangement as services are provided. Revenue is presented net of discounts, fees and
other related taxes. Revenue derived from equipment leases is recognized when the lease agreement is entered into and control
of the equipment has passed to the customer. The Company s remaining revenue is derived from its rental property in Nye County,
Nevada.

The
Company recognized lease liabilities, with corresponding ROU assets, based on the present value of unpaid lease payments for existing
operating leases longer than twelve months. The ROU assets were adjusted per ASC 842 transition guidance for existing lease-related balances
of accrued and prepaid rent, and unamortized lease incentives provided by lessors. Operating lease cost is recognized as a single lease
cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Variable lease payments
for common area maintenance, property taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as expense in the period when the changes in
facts and circumstances on which the variable lease payments are based occur. The Company has elected not to separate lease and non-lease
components for all property leases for the purposes of calculating ROU assets and lease liabilities.

Goodwill
and Intangibles 

Goodwill
is recorded when the cost of acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Intangible assets other
than goodwill are recorded at fair value at the time acquired or at cost, if applicable. Intangible assets that do not have indefinite
lives are amortized in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed. If the pattern of economic
benefit cannot be reliably determined, the intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the legal or
estimated life. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter
using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment. 

In
performing the annual impairment test, the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value
and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. For goodwill, the Company first assesses
qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its 
carrying amount, and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative test is required
only if the Company concludes that it is more -likely-than-not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its 
carrying amount. For quantitative testing, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying
amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying
amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting
unit. 

Fair
values are determined using established business valuation techniques and models developed by the Company, estimates of market participant
assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and discount rates to value estimated cash flows. Changes in economic and operating
conditions, actual growth below the assumed market participant assumptions or an increase in the discount rate could result in an impairment
charge in a future period. 

Acquisitions 

Upon
acquisition of a business, the Company uses the income, market or cost approach (or a combination thereof) for the valuation as appropriate.
The valuation inputs in these models and analyses are based on market participant assumptions. Market participants are considered to
be buyers and sellers unrelated to the Company in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. 

Fair
value estimates are based on a series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.
Management values property, plant and equipment using the cost approach supported where available by observable market data, which includes
consideration of obsolescence. Management values acquired intangible assets using the relief from royalty method or excess earnings method,
forms of the income approach supported by observable market data for peer companies. The significant assumptions used to estimate the
value of the acquired intangible assets include discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of future cash flows (such
as revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates). Acquired inventories are marked to fair value for valuation of
the total purchase price. For certain items, the carrying value is determined to be a reasonable approximation of fair value based on
information available to the Company.

respectively. During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis on the MJH Research, Inc.
acquisition and its goodwill
balance based on assessed potential indicators of impairment, including recent disruptions to its business plan resulting from the
COVID-19 pandemic, the increasing uncertainty of near-term demand requirements, supply constraints and financing constraints. The
impairment assessment and valuation method require the Company to make estimates and assumptions regarding future operating results,
cash flows, changes in working capital and capital expenditures, selling prices, profitability, and the cost of capital. As a result
of the goodwill impairment evaluation, the Company determined that the fair value of the MJH Research, Inc. acquisition was below
carrying value, including goodwill, by .
This change was primarily due to changes in the timing and amount of expected cash flows resulting from lower projected revenues,
profitability and cash flows. Consequently, during the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company recorded a impairment
charge for the partial impairment of the MJH Research, Inc. acquisition goodwill. The Company does not anticipate that it will generate any further revenue through MJH Research, Inc. in the foreseeable
future.

18 Income Taxes (continued) 

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company s
deferred tax assets for federal and state income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: 

Other intangibles

 - 
 
 Deferred expenses

Net deferred tax assets 
 - 
 - 

A
valuation allowance is required to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will
not be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.
A full review of all positive and negative evidence needs to be considered. The Company has established a valuation allowance against
all its deferred tax assets. 

On
December 22, 2017, H.R. 1 (the Act was enacted and included broad tax reforms. The Act reduced the U.S. corporate tax
rate from to effective January 1, 2018. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately 
and credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitations due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 and similar state provisions. The annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before
utilization. The Company has not performed a Section 382 study as of December 31, 2022. 

The
Company files income tax returns in the U.S. The Company is not currently under examination in any of these jurisdictions and all its
tax years remain open to examination due to net operating loss carryforwards. 

The
Company uses the more likely than not criterion for recognizing the income tax benefit of uncertain income tax positions
and establishing measurement criteria for income tax benefits. Although it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits
may increase or decrease within the next twelve months due to tax examination changes, settlement activities, expirations of statute
of limitations, or the impact on recognition and measurement considerations related to the results of published tax cases or other similar
activities, the Company does not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months. During the
year ended December 31, 2022, no interest or penalties were required to be recognized relating to unrecognized tax benefits. In the event
the Company should need to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax liabilities, this amount will be recorded
as an accrued liability and an increase to income tax expense. 

As
the Company operates in the legal cannabis industry, the Company is subject to Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code IRC which prohibits businesses engaged in the trafficking of controlled substances (within the meaning of Schedule I and II of the CSA) from
deducting normal business expenses associated with the sale of cannabis, such as payroll and rent, from gross income (revenue less cost
of goods sold). Section 280E, therefore, has a significant impact on the retail side of cannabis, but a lesser impact on cultivation
and manufacturing operations. Section 280E was originally intended to penalize criminal market operators, but because cannabis remains
a Schedule I controlled substance for U.S. Federal purposes, the Internal Revenue Service IRS has subsequently applied
Section 280E to state-legal cannabis businesses. The effective tax rate on a cannabis business depends on how large its ratio of non-deductible
expenses is to its total revenues. In the states that the Company operates in that align their tax codes with Section 280E, it is also
unable to deduct normal business expenses for state tax purposes. This results in permanent differences between ordinary and necessary
business expenses deemed non-allowable and a higher effective tax rate than most industries. Cannabis businesses operating in states
that align their tax codes with the IRC are also unable to deduct normal business expenses for state tax purposes. The non-deductible
expenses shown in the effective rate reconciliation above is comprised primarily of the impact of applying Section 280E to the Company s
businesses that are involved in selling cannabis, along with other typical non-deductible expenses such as lobbying expenses. 

The
IRS has invoked Section 280E in tax audits against various cannabis businesses in the U.S. that are permitted under applicable state
laws. Although the IRS issued a clarification allowing the deduction of certain expenses, the scope of such items is interpreted very
narrowly, and the bulk of operating costs and general administrative costs are not permitted to be deducted. While there are currently
several pending cases before various administrative and federal courts challenging these restrictions, there is no guarantee that these
courts will issue an interpretation of Section 280E favorable to cannabis businesses. Further, there are several pieces of legislation
being considered by the U.S. Congress that could change the interpretation of Section 280E by removing its applicability to the legalized
cannabis industry.
