 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements The following report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are statements that predict or describe future events or trends and that do not relate solely to historical matters. All of our projections in this annual report are forward-looking statements. You can generally identify forward-looking statements as statements containing the words appears, believe, expect, hope, may, will, anticipate, intend, estimate, project, assume or other similar expressions. Certain factors that might cause such a difference include the following: changes in general economic conditions; including changes that may influence group conference and guests vacation plans; changes in travel patterns; changes in consumer tastes in destinations or accommodations for group conferences and vacations; changes in Rental Pool participation by the current condominium owners; our ability to continue to operate the Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club, or the Resort under our management contracts; and the resale of condominiums to owners who elect neither to participate in the Rental Pool nor to become members of the Resort. You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements because the matters they describe are subject to known (and unknown) risks, uncertainties and other unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our forward-looking statements are based on the limited information currently available to us and speak only as of the date on which this report was filed with the Securities Exchange Commission. Our continued internet posting or subsequent distribution of this dated report does not imply continued affirmation of the forward-looking statements included in it. We undertake no obligation, and we expressly disclaim any obligation, to issue any updates to our forward-looking statements, even if subsequent events cause our expectations to change regarding the matters discussed in those statements. Future events are inherently uncertain. Moreover, it is particularly difficult to predict business activity levels at the Resort with any certainty. Accordingly, our projections in this annual report are subject to particularly high uncertainty. Our projections should not be regarded as legal promises, representations or warranties of any kind whatsoever. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and harmful to your interests.

 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Background Salamander Innisbrook, LLC (the Company was organized on June 14, 2007, by Salamander Farms, LLC under the laws of the state of Florida for the purpose of owning and operating Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club (the Resort ). The Company, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Salamander Innisbrook Securities, LLC and Salamander Innisbrook Condominium, LLC, are hereinafter referred to as we , us , our . On July 16, 2007, we purchased the Resort, three condominiums, which became Salamander Innisbrook Condominiums, LLC, and all of the equity interests in Golf Host Securities, Inc. from Golf Trust of America, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Resort is a full service 72-hole destination golf and conference facility located near Tampa, Florida. The Resort features 1,216 condominium rooms, all of which are owned by third parties or affiliates. Approximately 296 condominium owners (representing 295 hotel rooms) participate in a rental pool (the Rental Pool we operate. Rental Pool Condominiums Condominium ownership is a realty subdivision in which the individual lots are deemed apartment units. Instead of owning a plot of ground, the condominium owners own the space where their condominium units are located. This leaves substantial properties in interest which are not individually owned, such as the underlying land, driveways, parking lots, building foundations, exterior walls and roofs, garden areas and utility lines. These areas are termed common property or common elements. Each condominium owner has an undivided fractional interest in the common property. The condominium owners at the Resort have established an Association of Condominium Owners (the Association ), to administer and maintain this common property and to conduct the business of the condominium owners. In particular, the Association is responsible for maintaining insurance on the real property, upkeep of the structures, maintenance of the grounds, electricity for the common areas, water/sewer and security services. The Association assesses fees to defray these expenses and to establish necessary reserves. An assessment, if not timely paid, may result in a lien being placed upon the unit of a delinquent condominium owner. Each condominium owner must pay ad valorem property taxes, contents insurance, interior maintenance and other matters independent of the other unit owners. These expenses are incurred by each owner of condominium units whether or not the unit participates in the Rental Pool at the Resort. With respect to governing the affairs of the Association, the participating condominium owners are accorded one vote per condominium unit owned. State statutes also impact the way in which the Association s affairs are administered. Markets and Marketing The Resort is located in Palm Harbor, Florida and is a destination golf resort that appeals to group convention business and leisure travelers within all market segments. The Resort caters to corporate meeting planners and sports enthusiasts within a variety of industries, the majority of which are located in central and eastern United States. The Resort markets through most of the typical channels utilizing e-commerce, print media, third party representation firms, travel agents and wholesalers. The Resort provides condominium accommodations, four dining locations, room service, over 65,000 square feet of banquet and catering space, 72 holes of golf, golf instruction, a full-service spa and fitness center, tennis center and recreational entertainment to members, business meeting attendees, group meeting guests, leisure guests and their families. The Resort offers room-only rates, golf packages, and family vacation packages. Larger golf or conference groups typically involve contractual agreements. Accordingly, we do not believe that the loss of a single conference or even a few conferences of average size would have a significant adverse impact on our business taken as a whole. The Resort s accommodations are condominium units that are owned by third parties or us. These units are sold by registered securities brokers, including Golf Host Securities, Inc., which is one of our subsidiaries.

 Seasonality The Florida resort industry is seasonal in nature and historically the Resort s business levels are stronger in the winter and spring months as guests come from the northeast and other colder regions to enjoy the warm weather. In contrast, there is a decline in business levels during the summer months as the hot summer weather makes Florida less appealing for group golf outings and vacation destination golfers. The Resort uses seasonal pricing (peak, shoulder and off-peak) to maximize revenues. The Resort may also experience reduced bookings as a result of hurricane-related concerns. PGA TOUR Event The Valspar Championship, a nationally televised, annual PGA TOUR event, was contested on Innisbrook s Copperhead course April 29 May 2, 2021. This was a capacity restricted event by the PGA TOUR due to lingering COVID 19 concerns. The TOUR restricted attendance to 12,000 patrons per day. Further, there were mandated elimination of group gatherings, masking guidelines and spacing requirements. The 2022 Valspar Championship was contested at Innisbook s Copperhead course March 17-20, 2022 without any COVID related restrictions. Further, the tournament dates returned the event to the Florida Swing where four tournaments are contested on consecutive weekends in the state. There is a long-term agreement between the PGA TOUR, Copperhead Charities and Innisbrook through the 2025 event to contest the event on the Copperhead course. This coincides with the current agreement between Valspar and the PGA TOUR that expires after the 2025 event. Attendance estimates are expected to be roughly 30,000 patrons per day. Intellectual Property The Resort has registered service marks and domain names that are necessary for the Resort to effectively conduct business. Service marks include Innisbrook #955489, registered March 13, 1973, and the Innisbrook shield logo #955488 registered March 13, 1973. The operations of the Resort are not considered to be dependent upon the availability of raw materials, nor any adverse effects that may result from the duration of patents, licenses, franchises or concessions. Competition Conveniently located near the Florida Gulf Coast and Tampa International Airport, the Resort is located within 900 acres of a dramatically landscaped setting. The Resort competes using a unique price/value strategy through its offering of spacious accommodations, high levels of customer service, award-winning golf, and one of the largest conference facilities in the southeastern United States. The Resort s major competitors are other similar golf and conference-oriented resorts in the southeastern United States. Research and Development We have no research and development expenses. Environmental Matters Operation of the golf courses at the Resort involves the use and storage of various hazardous materials such as herbicides, pesticides, fertilizers, motor oils and gasoline. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in its property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of hazardous substances. As of May 05, 2023, we are not aware of any violations of these laws, ordinances and regulations. Government Regulation The Resort is subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA of 1990. The ADA has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities , but generally requires public facilities such as clubhouses and recreation areas to be accessible to people with disabilities. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. We are responsible for compliance costs incurred at the Resort. The condominiums in the Rental Pool are residential properties and are not subject to ADA.

 Employees At December 31, 2022, we had 414 employees; 306 full-time and 108 part-time. We also periodically engage casual laborers as needed. Code of Ethics See Part III, Item 10 for discussion of our Code of Business Conduct. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Not required for Smaller Reporting Company. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES The Resort is situated on approximately 900 acres of land located in the northern portion of Pinellas County, Florida, near the Gulf of Mexico. It is approximately 9 miles north of Clearwater and approximately 20 miles west of Tampa. There are 938 condominium units, 36 of which are strictly residential, with the balance eligible for Rental Pool participation. Of the 902 remaining eligible units, approximately 250 participate in the Rental Pool. See additional discussion in Item 1 under the caption Rental Pool Condominiums. These condominium units are leased by us from the condominium owners and used as hotel accommodations for the Resort. We also own three condominium units, all of which participate in the Rental Pool in the same fashion as all other Rental Pool participants. Approximately 20 of the units have lockout master bedroom units, which allow the rental of the condominium unit as two hotel rooms. As a result of the potential use of lockout master bedroom units, the total number of rooms at the resort is 1,218 and the average number of units participating in the Rental Pool at any one time is equivalent to approximately 295 hotel rooms. The Resort complex includes 72 holes of golf, practice ranges, three clubhouses with retail, golf, and food and beverage outlets, three conference and exhibit buildings, a full-service spa and fitness center, six swimming pools including a themed water attraction, a recreation facility, a tennis facility, and numerous administrative and support structures. These amenities are owned by the Company and have undergone substantial renovation and improvements since we purchased the Resort in 2007. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS At December 31 2021, we were involved in certain litigation arising from a full-service construction contract we previously entered (as agent for and on behalf of the Rental Pool participants) with AMH Construction, Inc. AMH in the amount of 3,420,670. The litigation arose from our decision to terminate the contract with AMH for breach of contract, including AMH s failure to complete the renovation work in accordance with the contract schedule. On April 18, 2019, we served a demand letter to AMH asserting damages of 4,423,070 for the additional costs incurred by the Participating Owners and return of deposits made for work that was not performed. On July 13, 2022, we and AMH entered into a settlement agreement with certain amounts to be paid over a two-year period, and included a signed a confessed judgment in the amount of 4,012,154. Payments began on August 1, 2022 and were supposed to continue through December 1, 2024; however, on December 15, 2022, AMH filed for Chapter 7 (also commonly known as liquidation bankruptcy. We received total payments of approximately 165,000 prior to such bankruptcy filing. We are working with our legal counsel to determine next steps. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES None.

 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES We are a single member limited liability company and do not have any stock. Our membership interests are not publicly traded. There are 902 deeded condominium units allowing Rental Pool participation by their owners, of which three are owned by us. The condominium units that are leased to us for Rental Pool participation, are deemed to be securities. These units are hereinafter referred to as Rental Pool Securities. These securities are deemed securities pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, but there is no market for such securities other than sales through the normal real estate market. Because the Rental Pool Securities are real estate related, no dividends have been paid or will be paid to their owners. However, the Rental Pool lease agreements provide that the Rental Pool participants are entitled to a contractual distribution paid quarterly in exchange for our right to use their condominium units in the Rental Pool. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Not required for Smaller Reporting Company. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following accounting policies are considered critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These and other accounting policies require that estimates be made based on assumptions and judgment, which can affect the reporting of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingencies in our consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results may differ from changes in these estimates and assumptions. Revenue Recognition Revenues are derived from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, hotel, food and beverage operations, retail sales, golf course operations and commissions on real estate transactions. With the exception of initiation fees and membership dues, all revenues net of any sales and other taxes collected are recognized as products are delivered or services are performed. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account under the new revenue recognition standard. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our revenue is transactional, and the contracts performance obligation is generally satisfied at the time of the transaction. Revenues from performance obligations satisfied over time include membership dues, annual fees and initiation fees. The membership initiation fees at the Resort are nonrefundable and are initially recorded when received as deferred revenue and amortized over the average life of a membership which, based on historical information, is deemed to be ten years for full golf members and five years for resort and executive memberships. Membership dues and annual fees are recognized over the applicable membership period (three months to one year depending on type of membership). Intangible Assets We evaluate our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or at an interim date if a significant event occurs or circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important, and which could indicate impairment, include the following: (I) significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; and (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends.

Table of Contents 
 Our intangible assets consist of: (i) a water contract; and (ii) our trademark and trade name. The valuation of the water contract is based on the projected annual savings associated with having this contract. The valuation of the trademark and trade name is derived from the residual revenue streams from Resort revenues that is attributed to the Innisbrook trade name. We attribute an indefinite life to both of these intangibles. During the year ending December 31, 2022, we evaluated our intangible assets, and determined that the carrying balances of such assets were recoverable. Impairment of Other Long-Lived Assets We review our other long-lived assets for impairment if a significant event occurs or circumstances arise that indicate the assets may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying values of the assets with their estimated future undiscounted cash flows. In reviewing impairment of our long-lived assets, we review the recent operating and pricing trends with the financial performance of the Resort in the aggregate for material variances from our expectations of the Resort s revenues. At December 31, 2022, we believe the carrying values of our other long-lived assets are recoverable. Loss Contingencies We estimate loss contingencies in accordance with FASB ASC 450-20 Loss Contingencies, which states that a loss contingency shall be accrued by a charge to operations if both of the following conditions are met: (a) information available before the consolidated financial statements are issued or are available to be issued indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Results of Operations 

Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 Inc/(dec) Chg Resort revenues: Room revenues 8,853,581 20.0 6,967,712 20.1 1,885,869 27.1 Other revenues 35,343,422 80.0 27,641,314 79.9 7,702,108 27.9 Total revenues 44,197,003 100.0 34,609,026 100.0 9,587,977 27.7 Costs and expenses: Operating costs and expenses 17,987,886 40.7 17,365,673 50.2 622,213 3.6 General and administrative 22,686,634 51.3 14,974,490 43.3 7,712,144 51.5 Depreciation and amortization 2,563,774 5.8 2,592,004 7.5 (28,230) -1.1 Total costs and expenses 43,238,294 97.8 34,932,167 100.9 8,306,127 23.8 Operating income (loss) 958,709 2.2 (323,141) -0.9 1,281,850 -396.7 Gain on forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program loan 2,000,000 5.8 3,394,500 9.8 (1,394,500) -41.1 Interest expense (422,265) -1.2 (348,771) -1.0 (73,494) 21.1 Net income 2,536,444 5.7 2,722,588 7.9 (186,144) -6.8 During 2022 overall resort revenues increased by 9,587,977 or 27.7 compared with the prior year. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Total costs and expenses increased year-over-year by 8,306,127 or 23.8 which is attributable to inflation and the increase in revenues across the same period. Our revenues and results of operations improved considerably in 2022 as activity at the Resort increased due to certain restrictions imposed by the COVID 19 pandemic were relaxed. In April 2020, we received a Paycheck Protection Program loan PPP loan of 3,394,500. At December 31, 2020, the loan had an interest rate of 1 and a term of 5 years, however under the program, the loan, and related accrued interest, was eligible to be forgiven by the Small Business Administration SBA for costs we incurred for payroll, rent, utilities, and other allowable expenses in 2020. In 2020, we used the full amount received from the PPP loan for eligible expenses and in 2021 received notice that the entire PPP loan

Table of Contents 
 had been forgiven by the SBA. As such, we recognized a gain on the extinguishment of the debt in the amount of the indebtedness in our 2021 consolidated statement of operations. In June 2021, we received a second PPP loan of 2,000,000 that had an interest rate of 1 and a term of 5 years. The loan and related accrued interest were eligible for forgiveness by the SBA assuming we used the proceeds for eligible costs (i.e. payroll, rent, utilities, and other allowable expenses). In 2021, we used the full amount received from the PPP loan for eligible expenses and in 2022 received notice that the entire second PPP loan had been forgiven. As such, we recognized a gain on the extinguishment of the debt in the amount of the indebtedness in our 2022 consolidated statement of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash generated from operating activities approximated 3,406,300 and 1,076,600 in 2022, and 2021, respectively. After accounting for the decline in net income in 2022 compared to 2021 of approximately 200,000, the increase in cash generated by operations was approximately 2,300,000 (which change resulted primarily from the following): The gain on forgiveness of debt (which did not generate cash) was approximately 1,394,000 less in 2022 than it was in 2021 Net cash outflows arising from affiliate receivables and payables were approximately 840,000 less in 2022 compared to 2021. We used cash of approximately 1,426,800 and 930,800 for investing activities in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in purchases of property and equipment of approximately 653,000. We used cash of approximately 803,700 in 2022 for financing activities and generated cash from such activities of approximately 1,080,500 in 2021. The difference of approximately 1,884,000 resulted primarily from proceeds received from a 2,000,000 paycheck protection loan in 2021. We are obligated under a note payable that requires monthly payments of principal (approximately 73,000) and interest. On July 5, 2022, the loan was amended whereby it will be paid via monthly principal payments of 73,051 commencing on August 5, 2022 and continuing thereafter until July 5, 2034 at which time the balance will be paid. The loan is collateralized by our real and personal property, the assignment and/or subordination of leases and our management agreement with an affiliate and guarantees by certain affiliates. We believe that our cash on hand and additional cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet this and other obligations (both capital and operating) for the next twelve months. Legal Entity Structure Salamander Innisbrook, LLC is a single member limited liability company with Salamander Farms, LLC as the sole member. Income Tax Status With the exception of an entity owned by Salamander Innisbrook Securities, LLC for which income taxes have been minimal the Company and its subsidiaries are single member limited liability companies and therefore the results of our operations flow through to our member for inclusion in its income tax returns. Accordingly, no provision or liability for federal or state income taxes has been included in our consolidated financial statements presented in this report. We have adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . Under this topic, we are required to evaluate each of our tax positions to determine if they are more likely than not to be sustained if the taxing authority examines the respective position. A tax position includes an entity s tax status, as a pass-through entity, and the decision not to file a tax return. We have evaluated each of our tax positions and have determined that no provision or liability for income taxes is necessary. We evaluate the validity of our conclusions regarding uncertain income tax positions on an annual basis to determine if facts or circumstances have arisen that might cause us to change our judgment regarding the likelihood of a tax position s sustainability under examination. Our member files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the State of Virginia. Environmental Matters None.

We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or unconsolidated financial partnerships of the type often referenced as structured finance or special purpose entities, i.e., unconsolidated entities established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities, nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide additional funding to any such entities. Accordingly, we believe we are not materially exposed to any market, credit, liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Commitments The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022:

 (1) Amounts include principal payments only (2) Projected interest payments are based on the outstanding principal amounts and interest rates at December 31, 2022 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. The carrying value of variable rate debt financing reflected in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022, approximates fair value as the changes in their associated interest rates reflect the current market and credit risk is similar to when the loans were originally obtained. We are obligated under a note payable with interest at the SOFR rate plus 2.30 per annum adjusted monthly. The loan is collateralized by our real and personal property and guarantees of certain affiliates. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the note payable consisted of the following:

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 15d -15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be reported in our SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. At December 31, 2022, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, at December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Management s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the framework stated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered certified public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION Land Development and Sale Contract On April 13, 2021, we entered into an Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of Real Property with Toll Brothers, Inc. for the sale and residential development of approximately 53 acres of land along the northern boundary of the property. The sale is contingent upon approval of a land use plan amendment and an amendment to the RPD master plan for Innisbrook from Pinellas County and other governmental agencies. We filed a plan amendment application with Pinellas County on December 15, 2021.

On May 24, 2022, our application for an amendment to our Land Use Plan and an amendment to the RPD master plan was unanimously approved for transmission to the State of Florida by the Board of County Commissioners of Pinellas County. We are continuing through the regulatory approval process.

The operation of the Rental Pool is tied closely to the Resort operations. The Rental Pool Master Lease Agreement provides for a quarterly distribution of a percentage of the room revenues to participating condominium owners Participants ), as defined in the agreements (see Note 1 of the Rental Pool Lease Operation financial statements).

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Rental Pool as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and changes in participants fund balances for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Rental Pool s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Rental Pool s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Rental Pool in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Rental Pool is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Rental Pool s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

 INNISBROOK RENTAL POOL LEASE OPERATION SUPPLEMENTAL NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2022 and 2021 of the Adjusted Gross Revenues on the first million, between million and million, and above million. Adjusted Gross Revenues are defined as Gross Revenues less agent s commissions, audit fees, occupancy fees or when the unit is used for Rental Pool Comps or as a model, linen replacements, and credit card fees. Each participant receives a fixed occupancy fee, based upon apartment size, for each day the unit is occupied. After allocation of occupancy fees and the payment of general Rental Pool expenses, the balance is allocated proportionally to the Participants, based on the Participation Factor as defined in the Agreement. Additionally, occupancy fees are paid by the Resort to Participants as rental fees for complimentary rooms unrelated to the Rental Pool operations. Associate room fees are also paid by the Resort to Participants for total room revenues earned from the rental of condominiums by Company employees. Under the terms of the Agreement, each owner may elect to participate in the Rental Pool for the following year by signing and executing an Annual Lease Agreement (the ALA ). In 2022 and 2021, amounts available to Participants under the Agreement approximated and , respectively, of which approximately and was owed as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The balances owed, along with the incentives discussed in the following paragraph, were paid by the Company in 2023 and 2022, respectively. On August 20, 2018, the Second Addendum to the Master Lease Agreement became effective. The addendum defined the Turn-Key renovation, the Customization of certain units that did not require a full renovation and provided for an Incentive to be paid by the Company to the participants. The Incentive provides for a quarterly payment to each participant, beginning on January 1, 2019 and ending on December 31, 2023, so long as the unit continues to participate in the Rental Pool. Incentive payments due as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, totaled and , respectively. On June 13, 2019, the Third Addendum to the Master Lease Agreement became effective. The addendum provided with two options for funding of the cost overruns created by the default of the AMH contractor. The first option provided for the Company to fund the cost overruns in exchange for the participant s dedication of the unit to the Rental Pool as evidenced by a Memorandum of Lease recorded against the title of such participant s unit in the land records of Pinellas County. The second option provided an additional incentive equal to the cost overrun amount in the form of quarterly payments, adjusted annually, resulting in a reimbursement of of the total amount in 2019, in 2020, in 2021, in 2022, and the remainder in 2023. The additional incentive is included in Incentives under adjustments to net income distribution on the statement of operations distribution fund. Nature of Accounts and Fund Balances - The Rental Pool consists of the Distribution Fund and the Maintenance Escrow Fund. The Distribution Fund s balance sheet primarily reflects amounts receivable from the Company for the Rental Pool distribution payable to Participants and amounts due to the Maintenance Escrow Fund. The operations of the Distribution Fund reflect the calculation of pooled earnings, management fees and adjustments, as defined. The Maintenance Escrow Fund, which is managed by the LAC reflects the accounting for certain escrowed assets of the Participants and, therefore, has no operations. It consists primarily of amounts escrowed on behalf of Participants or amounts due from the Distribution Fund to meet minimum escrow requirements, fund the carpet care reserve, maintain the interior of the units, and fund renovations of the units. The Innisbrook Rental Pool Trust was established on February 1, 2002 to create a Trust, which holds certain assets maintained in such escrow accounts.

 of the Occupancy Fees earned by each Participant are deposited in the Participant s Maintenance Escrow Fund account. Beginning in 2011, by mutual agreement between the LAC and the Resort, until it is determined that the fund requires replenishment, both the occupancy fee (Paragraph 7.3 of the MLA) and the carpet care reserve (Paragraph 1.6 of the MLA) deposit amounts will be . This account provides funds for payment of amounts that are due from Participants under the Agreement for maintenance and refurbishment services. Should a Participant s balance fall below that necessary to provide adequate funds for maintenance and replacements, the Participant is required to restore the escrow balance to a defined minimum level. The MLA provides for specific fund balances to be maintained, by unit type, size and age of refurbishment, as defined in the Agreement. Under the MLA, a percentage of the occupancy fees are deposited into the carpet care reserve in the Maintenance Escrow Fund, which bears the expenses of carpet cleaning for all Participants. This percentage is estimated to provide the amount necessary to fund carpet cleaning expenses and may be adjusted annually. The amounts expended for carpet care were approximately for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The LAC invests the maintenance escrow funds on behalf of the Participants and in compliance with restrictions in the Agreements. The LAC consists of nine Participants elected to advise the Resort owner in Rental Pool matters and negotiate amendments to the lease agreement. Income earned on these investments is allocated proportionately to Participants Maintenance Escrow Fund accounts and paid quarterly.
