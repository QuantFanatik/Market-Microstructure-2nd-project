We are also the exclusive United States Multi-Level Marketing MLM distributor of Usborne Publishing Limited Usborne children s books.

Table of Contents 

(b) Financial Information about Our Segments 

We sell children s books, educational toys and games and other related products (collectively referred to as products or books through two business segments, which we refer to as divisions or sales channels : 

Direct Sales Division PaperPie This division sells our books and products through independent brand partners direct to the customer. Our Brand Partners sell our products in various ways, including hosting home parties, through social media collaboration platforms on the internet, hosting book fairs with school and public libraries and through other events. This division had approximately 24,600 active Brand Partners as of February 28, 2023. 

Publishing Division EDC Publishing or Publishing This is our trade division which markets through commissioned trade representatives who call on retail book, toy and specialty stores along with other retail outlets. This division also has in-house representatives marketing by telephone and email to these customers and potential customers. This division markets to approximately 4,000 retail outlets. In addition to exhibiting at national trade and regional bookselling shows, our products are featured in agency showrooms in AmericasMart Atlanta, Dallas Market Center, and Minneapolis Mart. Under the contracted terms in our new distribution agreement, the Company no longer had the rights to distribute Usborne s products to retail customers effective November 15, 2022, at which date Usborne planned to engage a different distributor to supply their products to retail accounts. The November 15, 2022 transition date, at Usborne s request, was extended until their new supplier can start distribution during 2023.

(c) Narrative Description of Business 

Products 

EDC s current catalog contains approximately 2,000 titles, with new additions added four times per year across all lines of our products. Additionally, throughout the year, a similar number of titles that do not have sufficient sales are identified as out of print and these titles are no longer re-printed or included in future catalogs. The Company sells through the remaining quantities of these out of print titles through their normal sales channels at normal pricing and has not historically participated in the publishing industry s remainder market. Many of our products are interactive in nature, including our touchy-feely board books, activity books and flashcards, adventure and search books, art books, sticker books, foreign language books, learning manipulatives and toys. We also have a broad line of internet-linked books which allow readers to expand their educational experience by referring them to relevant non-Company websites. Our books also include science and math titles, as well as chapter books and novels. Many of our Kane Miller books were originally published in other countries, in their native languages, and we translate them to common American English and have exclusive rights to publish the titles in the United States. Certain Kane Miller agreements include North American rights and these titles are also sold into Canada. Our SmartLab Toys and Learning Wrap-Ups imprints are owned product lines that are sold domestically and internationally, including the sale of foreign distribution rights to specific customers. 

Seasonality 

Sales for both divisions are greatest during the fall due to the holiday season. 

Competition 

While we have the exclusive rights to sell Kane Miller books, Learning Wrap-Ups, SmartLab Toys and are the exclusive United States Multi-Level Marketing MLM distributor of Usborne books, we face competition from other publishers selling on the internet and directly to our customer base. Our PaperPie division competes in recruiting and retaining brand partners, which continuously receive opportunities to work for other direct selling companies, as well as new non-traditional employment opportunities, especially in the gig marketplace that provide part-time supplemental income. We also compete with other publishers in the school and library book fair market, of which Scholastic Corporation is the largest.

Table of Contents 

Our Publishing division faces competition from U.S. and international publishing companies that sell online and through the same retail bookstores, toy stores, and gift and novelty stores that offer a variety of non-book products. 

Employees 

As of April 26, 2023, 138 full-time employees worked at our Tulsa, OK, San Diego, CA, Layton, UT and Seattle, WA facilities. Of these employees, approximately 56 work in our distribution warehouse in Tulsa, OK. 

Company Reports 

Pursuant to Section 13 or 15 of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing electronically or otherwise furnishing it to the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), we make available, free of charge, on our website (www.edcpub.com) copies of our Annual Reports and Quarterly Reports. Our website also includes an internet link to the federal SEC website that contains additional public reports, including Current Reports on Form 8-K, amendments to those reports filed or furnished to the SEC and reports of holdings of our securities filed by our officers and directors under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. These reports will be provided electronically, free of charge, upon request. 

Employee Retention Credit 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ), which, among other things, included a provision related to the Employee Retention Credit. The Company applied the provisions of the CARES Act as applicable. In fiscal 2024, the Company applied for employee retention credits for Q1, Q2 and Q3 wages paid in calendar year 2021. In connection with the CARES Act, the Company adopted a policy to recognize the employee retention credit when realized under Accounting Standards Codification ASC 450-30, Gain Contingencies . Accordingly, the total requested credits of 3.6 million are not recorded in the Company s financial statements until the credits are received, as the Company is not certain the credits will be issued.

Management Summary 

We are the owner and exclusive publisher of Kane Miller children s books; Learning Wrap-Ups, maker of educational manipulatives; and SmartLab Toys, maker of STEAM-based toys and games. We are also the exclusive United States Multi-Level Marketing MLM distributor of Usborne Publishing Limited Usborne children s books. Significant portions of our inventory purchases are concentrated with Usborne. Our distribution agreement with Usborne includes annual minimum purchase volumes along with specific payment terms, which, if not met or if payments are not received timely, may result in termination of the agreement. During fiscal 2023, the Company did not meet the minimum purchase volumes and certain payments were not received timely. No notification of termination has been received and Usborne continues to accept and fulfill purchase orders from the Company. Should termination of the agreement occur, the Company will be allowed, at a minimum, to sell through their remaining Usborne inventory over the twelve months following the termination date. 

We sell our products through two separate divisions, PaperPie and Publishing. These two divisions each have their own customer base. The PaperPie division markets our complete line of products through a network of independent brand partners using a combination of home shows, internet party events and book fairs. The Publishing division markets Kane Miller, Learning Wrap-Ups and SmartLab Toys on a wholesale basis to various retail accounts. All other supporting administrative activities are recognized as other expenses outside of our two divisions. Other expenses consist primarily of the compensation for our office, warehouse and sales support staff as well as the cost of operating and maintaining our corporate offices and distribution facility.

PaperPie Division 

Our PaperPie division uses a multi-level direct selling organizational structure to market our products using independent sales representatives Brand Partners located throughout the United States. The customer base of PaperPie consists of individual purchasers, as well as schools and public libraries. Revenues are primarily generated through book showings in individual homes, on social media collaboration platforms, through book fairs with school and public libraries and other in-person events. 

An important factor in the continued growth of the PaperPie division is the addition of new brand partners and the retention of existing Brand Partners. Current active Brand Partners (defined as those with sales during the past six months) are primarily responsible for recruiting new brand partners. PaperPie makes it easy to recruit by providing joining incentives to new brand partners including discounted products and cash bonus awards based on exceeding certain sales criteria. In addition, our PaperPie division provides our Brand Partners with an extensive operational handbook, valuable training, and an individual website they can customize and use to generate sales. The Company also provides a back-office operations platform that allows Brand Partners to track their individual and team business results.

Brand Partners 

Team Leaders 

Advanced Leaders 

Senior Leaders 

Executive Leaders

Directors 

Senior Directors 

Upon signing up, sales representatives begin as Brand Partners . Brand Partners receive weekly commissions from each sale they make; the commission rate they receive on each sale is determined by the order type under which the sale is made. In addition, Brand Partners receive a monthly sales bonus once their total sales reach an established monthly goal and other awards (called Level Perks for meeting other individual sales and recruiting goals for the month. Brand Partners who recruit a specified number of other Brand Partners into their downline become Team Leaders . These downline recruits are known as their "Central Group". Upon reaching this Team Leader level, Brand Partners become eligible to receive monthly override payments which are calculated on sales made by their Central Group and downlines up to two levels below. Team Leaders that recruit and promote other Team Leaders, and meet other established criteria, are eligible to become Advanced Leaders . 

Once Advanced Leaders promote a second level Brand Partner, add additional recruits and meet other established criteria, they become Senior Leaders , Executive Leaders , Senior Executive Leaders , Directors or Senior Directors . One-time cash bonus payments are made to Advance Leaders and higher at each promotion level. Executive Leaders and higher receive an additional monthly override payment based upon the sales of their executive group. Directors and higher receive an additional bonus payment if they promote a Team Leader from their Central Group. The maximum override payment a leader can receive is calculated on their Central Group and three levels below. 

During fiscal year 2023, internet sales continued to be the largest sales channel within our PaperPie division. The use of social media and party plan platforms, such as those available on Facebook, continue to be popular sales tools. These platforms allow Brand Partners to present and customers to attend online purchasing events from any geographical location.

Table of Contents 

Customers internet orders are primarily received via the Brand Partner s customized website, which is hosted by the Company. Brand Partners contact hosts or hostesses (collectively hostess who then provide a list of contacts to invite to an online party. During the online party, the Brand Partner answers attendees questions and provides product recommendations. These attendees then select desired products and place orders via the Brand Partner s customized website. Internet orders are processed through a standard online shopping cart checkout and the Brand Partner receives sales credit and commission on the transaction. All internet orders are shipped directly to the end customer. The hostess earns discounted products based on the total sales from the attendees at the online party. Brand Partners use the list of contacts provided by the hostess as additional contacts for future hostess and recruiting opportunities. 

In-person parties also occur when Brand Partners contact hostesses to hold book shows in their homes. The Brand Partner assists the hostess in setting up the details for the show, makes a presentation at the show and takes orders for the products. The hostess earns discounted products based on the total sales at the party, including internet orders for those customers who can only attend via online access. These orders are typically shipped to the hostess who then distributes the products to the end customer. Customer specials are also available when customers, or their party, order above a specified amount. As with online parties, home shows often provide an excellent opportunity for recruiting new brand partners. 

PaperPie net revenues also includes sales to schools and libraries through PaperPie Learning, a separate program for Brand Partners which requires them to pass certain qualifications and complete training requirements. The PaperPie Learning program includes book fairs which are held with an organization as the sponsor. The Brand Partner provides promotional materials to introduce our products to parents, who then turn in their orders at a designated time. The book fair program generates discounted products for the sponsoring organization. 

PaperPie also generates revenues through various fundraiser programs directed toward schools and community organizations. Reach for the Stars is a pledge-based reading incentive program that provides cash and products to the sponsoring organization and products for the participating children. An additional fundraising program, Cards for a Cause , offers our Brand Partners the opportunity to help members of the community by sharing proceeds from the sale of specific items. Organizations sell variety boxes of greeting-type cards and donate a portion of the proceeds to help support their related causes. 

Publishing Division 

Our Publishing division operates in a market that is highly fragmented, with many types of retail companies engaged in selling children s books and toys. The Publishing division s customer base includes national book chains, regional and local bookstores, toy and gift stores, school supply stores and museums. To reach these markets, the Publishing division utilizes a combination of commissioned sales representatives and an in-house sales group located at our headquarters.

Publishing uses a variety of methods to attract potential new customers and maintain current customers. Our employees attend many of the national trade shows held by the book and toy selling industry each year, allowing us to contact potential buyers who may be unfamiliar with our products. Our marketing strategy targets toy and specialty stores, in addition to bookstores and museum gift shops, through print media advertising in trade publications. In some instances, our products are featured in promotions and catalogs by participation in co-ops with national chain retailers. 

Publishing s sales representatives actively target the smaller independent book and gift store customers. This market has seen continued growth due to a resurgence in the opening of local bookstores, toy stores, and specialty stores across the U.S., coupled with the efforts of both our in-house and outside sales representatives to increase sales to local and independent businesses. The Company shifted its focus toward independent stores as national chain stores saw a change in buying programs and purchasing slowed with COVID-19. Our semi-annual, full-color, 128-page catalogs are mailed to approximately 4,000 customers and potential customers. See Publishing Operating Results for discussion of our updated distribution agreement with Usborne.

Non-Segment Operating Results 

Total operating expenses not associated with a reporting segment were 14.9 million for fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, compared to 17.8 million for the same period a year ago. Operating expenses decreased 2.9 million primarily as a result of a reduction in labor expenses of 2.5 million, with our warehouse payroll having the largest reduction, and a 0.9 million decrease in freight-handling costs, both associated with a decrease in gross sales, plus a 0.2 million decrease in warehouse rent for reduced inventory levels. These expense reductions were offset by a 0.3 million increase in depreciation expense primarily related to the addition of the new pick-pack-ship lines placed into service in fiscal year 2022, a 0.3 million increase in property taxes and insurance costs, and a 0.1 million increase in expenses related to the purchase of SmartLab Toys and the addition of the Seattle, WA office location. 

Interest expense increased 1.3 million, to 2.2 million for fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, compared to 0.9 million reported for fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, due to increased borrowings with our lenders primarily associated with inventory and increases in floating interest rates. 

Other income decreased 0.6 million, to 1.3 million for fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, compared to 1.9 million reported for fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, due to 0.3 million of recovered losses in fiscal 2022 associated with a shipping vessel incident in fiscal 2021 that did not repeat in the current fiscal year, 0.2 million of startup costs recognized from the acquisition of SmartLab Toys and 0.1 million in other various changes. 

Income taxes decreased 3.8 million, to a tax benefit of 0.9 million for fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, from a tax expense of 2.9 million for the same period a year ago. This decrease was primarily related to a decrease in taxable income for the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year. The effective tax rate increased by 0.8 , to 26.9 for fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, as compared to 26.1 for fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, primarily due to sales mix fluctuations between states. Our tax rates are higher than the federal statutory rate of 21 due to the inclusion of state income and franchise taxes.

PaperPie net revenues decreased 54.5 million, or 42.2 , to 74.5 million for fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, when compared with net revenues of 129.0 million reported for fiscal year ended February 28, 2022. The average number of active Brand Partners in fiscal year 2023 was 28,000, a decrease of 16,900, or 37.6 , from 44,900 in fiscal year 2022. The Company reports the average number of active Brand Partners as a key indicator for this division. Our Brand Partner numbers have declined due to Brand Partners returning to full-time employment, as well as families experiencing children returning to the classroom, therefore requiring less learning from home materials than they had in the prior year. We also saw new Brand Partner recruiting negatively impacted by the recent change in our distribution agreement with Usborne Publishing Limited. The new agreement created a level of uncertainty with our Brand Partners until we were able to effectively communicate the continuation of our relationship within the Direct Sales division. Further, sales were impacted in our fiscal fourth quarter as we rebranded our direct sales division from Usborne Books More UBAM to PaperPie. Our Brand Partners were challenged with updating their individual marketing materials, training videos and personal business websites to the new brand. The time spent updating these business items reduced our Brand Partners available time to generate sales, most clearly identified in the first two weeks of January 2023. In addition, sales during fiscal 2023 continued to be negatively impacted by economic factors that include recent record inflation, resulting in high fuel cost and food price increases that continue to impact the disposable income of our customers. We expect this impact on sales to continue as inflationary pressures persist. 

PaperPie gross margin decreased 41.9 million, or 45.6 , to 49.9 million for fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, from 91.8 million reported for fiscal year ended February 28, 2022. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased 4.3 to 66.9 for fiscal year 2023 when compared to 71.2 for fiscal year 2022. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues is attributed to higher discounts being offered to induce sales and a change in the mix of order types received impacting margins by approximately 1.0 million, rising ocean freight costs on inbound inventory totaling approximately 1.2 million, which increased cost of goods sold, and reduced purchasing volume discounts/rebates totaling approximately 1.0 million. 

Total PaperPie operating expenses decreased 26.7 million, or 39.6 , to 40.7 million during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, when compared with 67.4 million reported for fiscal year ended February 28, 2022. Operating and selling expenses decreased 6.3 million, to 12.5 million for fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, from 18.8 million reported in the same period a year ago. These decreases were due to a 7.5 million decrease in shipping costs associated with the decrease in volume of orders shipped from lower sales, offset by a 1.2 million increase in accruals for Brand Partner incentive trip expenses and convention expenses. Sales commissions decreased 18.7 million, to 25.1 million during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, when compared to 43.8 million reported in the same period a year ago primarily due to the decrease in net revenues. General and administrative expenses decreased 1.7 million, to 3.1 million during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, when compared with 4.8 million reported for fiscal year ended February 28, 2022. This decrease was due to 1.0 million of decreased credit card transaction fees associated with decreased sales volumes, a 0.4 million decrease in promotions and marketing expenses associated with decreased Brand Partner counts, and a 0.3 million decrease in payroll and various other expenses.

Operating income of our PaperPie division decreased 15.2 million, or 62.3 , to 9.2 million for fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, as compared to 24.4 million reported for fiscal year ended February 28, 2022. Operating income for the PaperPie division as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended February 28, 2023, was 12.3 , compared to 18.9 for the year ended February 28, 2022, a change of 6.6 . Operating income as a percentage of net revenues changed from the prior year primarily due to the decrease in net revenues caused by higher discounts and lower transportation revenue, the increase in cost of goods sold resulting from higher inbound freight costs along with fewer rebates and discounts associated with purchase volumes and the increase in accrued expenses for the Company s Brand Partners related to the annual incentive trip and convention.

Our Publishing division s net revenues remained consistent at 13.3 million for fiscal years ended February 28, 2023 and 2022. During fiscal 2023, we entered into a new distribution agreement with Usborne. Under the contracted terms in our new distribution agreement, the Company no longer had the rights to distribute Usborne s products to retail customers after November 15, 2022, at which time Usborne was planning to use a different distributor to supply retail accounts with their products. The November 15, 2022 transition date, at Usborne s request, was extended until their new supplier can start distribution in 2023. Usborne s products sold within the Publishing division accounted for 83.1 , or 23.2 million, of gross sales during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2023. 

Gross margin remained consistent, increasing 0.1 million, to 6.2 million for fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, from 6.1 million reported for fiscal year ended February 28, 2022. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues increased 0.3 , to 46.4 for fiscal year 2023, compared to 46.1 reported the same period a year ago due to a change in customer mix. Customers receive varying discounts due to higher sales volumes and contract terms. 

Operating expenses increased 0.5 million, to 3.0 million for fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, from 2.5 million reported for fiscal year ended February 28, 2022. The increase in operating expenses resulted from the full year inclusion of Learning Wrap-Ups office staff and related expenses in fiscal year 2023. Learning Wrap-Ups was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. 

Operating income for the segment decreased 0.4 million, or 11.1 , to 3.2 million for fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, from 3.6 million reported during the same period last year. The decrease in operating income resulted primarily from the increase in operating expenses attributable to a full year impact of Learning Wrap-Ups office staff and related expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

EDC has a history of profitability and positive cash flow. We typically fund our operations from the cash we generate. During periods of loss, like fiscal year 2023, EDC will reduce purchases and sell through inventory to generate cash flows. The Company expects to reduce current excess inventory levels and use the cash proceeds to pay down the line of credit and portions of the term debt. Available cash has historically been used to pay down outstanding bank loan balances, for capital expenditures, to pay dividends and to acquire treasury stock. We utilize a bank credit facility and other term loan borrowings to meet our short-term cash needs, as well as fund capital expenditures, when necessary. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, our revolving bank credit facility loan balance was 10.6 million with 4.4 million in available capacity.

During fiscal year 2023, we experienced positive cash flows from operations of 58,500. These cash flows resulted from: 

net loss of 2,504,900 

Adjusted for: 

depreciation and amortization expense of 2,478,700 

share-based compensation expense, net of 907,800 

provision for inventory allowance of 715,900 

Offset by: 

deferred income taxes of 678,100 

Positively impacted by: 

decrease in inventories, net of 9,086,900 

decrease in accounts receivable of 732,100 

Negatively impacted by: 

decrease in accounts payable of 8,547,900 

decrease in accrued salaries, commissions, and other liabilities of 1,578,000 

decrease in income taxes payable of 241,900 

increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 233,200 

decrease in deferred revenues of 78,900 

Cash used in investing activities was 1,755,800 for capital expenditures, consisting of 852,500 of software upgrades to our proprietary systems that our Brand Partners use to monitor their business and place customer orders, 766,400 associated with the purchase of SmartLab Toys, 132,000 of other assets associated with the Company s rebrand of the PaperPie sales division and 4,900 of other various changes. 

Cash provided by financing activities was 2,025,200, which was comprised of net proceeds from term debt of 36,000,000 and cash received in treasury stock transactions of 63,400, offset by payments on term debt of 25,900,100, net payments on the line of credit of 7,089,000, payments of 870,700 for dividends declared in fiscal 2022 and paid in fiscal 2023 and payments of debt issuance costs of 178,400. 

We continue to expect the cash generated from our operations, specifically from the reduction of excess inventory, and cash available through our line of credit with our Lender will provide us the liquidity we need to support ongoing operations. Cash generated from operations will be used to purchase inventory in order to expand our product offerings and to pay down existing debt. 

On August 9, 2022, the Company repaid in full all outstanding indebtedness and terminated all commitments and obligations under its Amended and Restated Loan Agreement dated February 15, 2021 (as amended), between the Company and MidFirst Bank. The Company s payment to MidFirst Bank, including interest, was approximately 45.0 million, which satisfied all the Company s debt obligations with MidFirst Bank. The Company did not incur any early termination penalties as a result of the repayment of indebtedness or termination of the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, which provided Term Loan #1, Advancing Term Loan #1, Advancing Term Loan #2 and the Revolving Loan. 

On August 9, 2022, the Company executed a new Credit Agreement Loan Agreement with BOKF, NA Bank of Oklahoma or the Lender ). The Loan Agreement established a fixed rate term loan in the principal amount of 15,000,000 (the Fixed Rate Term Loan ), a floating rate term loan in the principal amount of 21,000,000 (the Floating Rate Term Loan together with the Fixed Rate Term Loan, collectively, the Term Loans ), and a revolving promissory note in the principal amount up to 15,000,000 (the Revolving Loan ).

Features of the Loan Agreement include: 

(i) 

Term Loans on 20-year amortization with 5-year maturity date of August 9, 2027 

(ii) 

Revolving Loan maturity date of August 9, 2023 

(iii) 

Fixed Rate Term Loan bears interest at a fixed rate per annum equal to 4.26 

(iv) 

Floating Rate Term Loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to Term SOFR Rate + 1.75 (effective rate was 6.28 at February 28, 2023) 

(v) 

Revolving Loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to Term SOFR Rate + 2.50 (effective rate was 7.03 at February 28, 2023) 

(vi) 

Revolving Loan allows for Letters of Credit up to 7,500,000 upon bank approval (none were outstanding at February 28, 2023) 

The Loan Agreement also contains provisions that require the Company to maintain a minimum fixed charge ratio and limit any additional debt with other lenders. The Company was in violation of the minimum fixed charge ratio covenant as of February 28, 2023, for which the Company obtained a written waiver of compliance from the Lender. Available credit under the current 15,000,000 revolving line of credit with the Lender was 4,365,500 at February 28, 2023. 

On December 22, 2022, the Company executed the First Amendment to our Credit Agreement with the Lender. This amendment clarified the definition of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio to exclude dividends paid prior to November 30, 2022, and placed restrictions on acquisitions and cash dividends. 

On May 10, 2023, the Company executed the Second Amendment to our Credit Agreement with the Lender. This amendment waived the fixed charge ratio default which occurred on February 28, 2023. The Second Amendment also added a cumulative maximum level of fiscal year to date inventory purchases through the expiration of the Revolving Loan Agreement, increased the borrowing rate on the Company s Revolving Loan to Term SOFR Rate + 3.5 , reduced the revolving commitment from 15,000,000 to 14,000,000, effective May 10, 2023, and further reduced the revolving commitment to 13,500,000, effective July 15, 2023, among lesser items. 

The Company does not expect to meet the fixed charge ratio, outlined in the Credit Agreement, during fiscal year 2024. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, not meeting this ratio could represent an Event of Default. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, should an Event of Default occur, the Lender will have the right to accelerate the maturities of the Fixed Rate Term Loan and Floating Rate Term Loan. As an Event of Default is expected, and no waiver of the Event of Default is guaranteed to be received by the Lender, the long-term portions of the Fixed Rate Term Loan and Float Rate Term Loan have been reclassified as current liabilities. 

The following table reflects aggregate current maturities of term debt, excluding the Revolving Loan, during the next fiscal year as follows:

In April 2008, our Board of Directors amended our 1998 stock repurchase plan, establishing that we may purchase up to an additional 1,000,000 shares of Company common stock as market conditions warrant. In February 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase plan to replace the amended 2008 plan. Under the new 2019 plan, the Company is authorized to purchase up to 800,000 shares of Company common stock, which represented approximately 9 of the outstanding shares as of February 28, 2023, of which 514,594 remains available to purchase as of February 28, 2023. Management has no plans to repurchase any outstanding shares until the Company returns to profitability. 

Risks and Uncertainties 

In accordance with ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), the Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued.

Table of Contents 

As an Event of Default is expected associated with the Loan Agreement, and there is no guaranty that the Event of Default will be waived by BOKF, NA, there is sufficient uncertainty that, should the bank choose to accelerate the maturities of the Fixed Rate Term Loan and Floating Rate Term Loan, the Company could continue as a going concern. Management has plans to enter into a new financing agreement by August 9, 2023, with BOKF, NA or another lender, that will allow it to operate without default and reclassify the non-current portions of the Fixed Rate Term Loan and Floating Rate Term Loan as long-term liabilities. 

Contractual Obligations 

We are a smaller reporting company and are not required to provide this information. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of February 28, 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Seasonality 

The Company experiences increased sales in the Fall season. Historically, we have experienced an increase in inventory during the Summer in anticipation for the Fall increase in sales. In addition, new titles are typically released twice a year, in the Spring and Fall, which increases our inventory in the months preceding these scheduled releases. We do not expect inventory to increase in fiscal year 2024 as we continue to sell down excess inventory. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our valuation of inventory, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, allowance for sales returns, long-lived assets and deferred income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 

Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Historically, however, actual results have not differed materially from those determined using required estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes accompanying the financial statements included elsewhere in this report. However, we consider the following accounting policies to be more significantly dependent on the use of estimates and assumptions. 

Share-Based Compensation 

We account for share-based compensation whereby share-based payment transactions with employees, such as stock options and restricted stock, are measured at estimated fair value at the date of grant. For awards subject to service conditions, compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. Awards subject to performance conditions are attributed separately for each vesting tranche of the award and are recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for each tranche. Forfeitures are recognized when they occur. Any cash dividends declared after the restricted stock award is issued, but before the vesting period is completed, will be reinvested in Company shares at the opening trading price on the dividend payment date. Shares purchased with cash dividends will also retain the same restrictions until the completion of the original vesting period associated with the awarded shares. 

The restricted share awards under the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2019 LTI Plan and 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2022 LTI Plan contain both service and performance conditions. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense only for the portion of the restricted share awards that are considered probable of vesting. Shares are considered granted, and the service inception date begins, when a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions between the Company and the employees has been established. The fair value of these awards is determined based on the closing price of the shares on the grant date. The probability of restricted share awards granted with future performance conditions is evaluated at each reporting period and compensation expense is adjusted based on the probability assessment. 

During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized 0.9 million and 1.0 million, respectively, of compensation expense associated with the shares granted.

Revenue Recognition 

Sales associated with product orders are recognized and recorded when products are shipped. Products are shipped FOB-Shipping Point. PaperPie s sales are generally paid at the time the product is ordered. Sales which have been paid for but not shipped are classified as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. Sales associated with consignment inventory are recognized when reported and payment associated with the sale has been remitted. Transportation revenue represents the amount billed to the customer for shipping the product and is recorded when the product is shipped. 

Estimated allowances for sales returns are recorded as sales are recognized. Management uses a moving average calculation to estimate the allowance for sales returns. We are not responsible for a product damaged in transit. Damaged returns are primarily received from the retail customers of our Publishing division. This damage occurs in the stores, not in shipping to the stores, and we typically do not offer credit for damaged returns. It is industry practice to accept non-damaged returns from retail customers. Management has estimated and included a reserve for sales returns of 0.2 million for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2023 and February 28, 2022. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

We maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and a reserve for vendor share markdowns, when applicable (collectively allowance for doubtful accounts ). An estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, customers financial conditions and current economic trends. Management has estimated and included an allowance for doubtful accounts of 0.2 million and 0.3 million for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2023 and February 28, 2022, respectively. 

Inventory 

Our inventory contains approximately 2,000 titles, each with different rates of sale depending upon the nature and popularity of the title. Almost all of our product line is saleable as the products are not topical in nature and remain current in content today as well as in the future. Most of our products are printed in China, Europe, Singapore, India, Malaysia and Dubai typically resulting in a four to eight-month lead-time to have a title printed and delivered to us. 

Certain inventory is maintained in a noncurrent classification. Management continually estimates and calculates the amount of noncurrent inventory. Noncurrent inventory arises due to occasional purchases of titles in quantities in excess of what will be sold within the normal operating cycle, due to the minimum order requirements of our suppliers. Noncurrent inventory is estimated by management using an anticipated turnover ratio by title, based primarily on historical trends. Inventory in excess of 2 years of anticipated sales is classified as noncurrent inventory. These inventory quantities have additional exposure for storage damages and related issues, and therefore have higher obsolescence reserves. Noncurrent inventory balances prior to valuation allowances were 5.1 million and 2.4 million at February 28, 2023 and February 28, 2022, respectively. Noncurrent inventory valuation allowances were 0.4 million at February 28, 2023 and February 28, 2022. 

Brand Partners that meet certain eligibility requirements may request and receive inventory on consignment. We believe allowing our Brand Partners to have consignment inventory greatly increases their ability to be successful in making effective presentations at home shows, book fairs and other events; in summary, having consignment inventory leads to additional sales opportunities. Approximately 8.5 of our active Brand Partners have maintained consignment inventory at the end of fiscal year 2023. Consignment inventory is stated at cost, less an estimated reserve for consignment inventory that is not expected to be sold or returned to the Company. The total cost of inventory on consignment with Brand Partners was 1.5 million and 1.4 million at February 28, 2023 and February 28, 2022, respectively. 

Inventories are presented net of a valuation allowance, which includes reserves for inventory obsolescence and reserves for consigned inventory that is not expected to be sold or returned to the Company. Management estimates the inventory obsolescence allowance for both current and noncurrent inventory, which is based on management s identification of slow-moving inventory. Management has estimated a valuation allowance for both current and noncurrent inventory, including the reserve for consigned inventory, of 0.9 million at February 28, 2023 and February 28, 2022.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

An evaluation was performed of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(a) as of February 28, 2023. This evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer). 

Based on that evaluation, these officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to them, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported in accordance with the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report on Form 10-K, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13(a) through 15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Based on our evaluation under the 2013 COSO Framework and applicable SEC rules, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February 28, 2023. 

This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this annual report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Educational Development Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Educational Development Corporation (the Company) as of February 28, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of February 28, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the auditing standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Liquidity and Management's Plans 

While the Company received a waiver for the fixed charge ratio default that occurred on February 28, 2023, the borrowing and purchasing capacity was restricted and management's forecast indicated that the Company will not be in compliance in future periods as described in Note 9. These conditions, among others in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt over the Company's ability to meet its obligations over the next twelve months. Management has evaluated these conditions and concluded that its plans have alleviated the substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue for at least the next twelve months. 

To assess their ability to meet obligations as they come due and assess future compliance with debt covenants for at least twelve months from the issuance date of the financial statements, the Company has forecasted future financial results which requires significant judgment and estimation. Additionally, there is significant judgment and increased level of audit effort involved in determining that it is probable that management's plans will be effectively implemented and alleviate substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue beyond the next twelve months.

Table of Contents 

Our audit procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included, among others: 

Reading and evaluating management's plans for dealing with the adverse effects of the conditions and events. 

Obtaining the Company's amended debt agreement and assessing whether the terms were appropriately considered on the Company's debt covenant compliance. 

Evaluating the reasonableness of management's significant assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of the forecast. 

Comparing the forecast to budgets provided to the board of directors, to historical results, to recent trends used in other audit areas and to subsequent actual results. 

Evaluating the adequacy of the disclosure included in the notes to the financial statements.
