7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following discussion highlights the principal factors that have affected our financial condition and results of operations as well as
our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements
and the related notes included in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please see Cautionary Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these forward-looking
statements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Accounting
policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results of operations
and that require management s subjective judgments are described below to facilitate a better understanding of our business activities.
Management bases its judgments on its experience and assumptions which it believes are reasonable and applicable under the circumstances. 

We
consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that
require the most subjective judgment: 

Valuation
of investments and credit facility allowances: Management relies on estimates of projected cashflows as support for the amounts
disclosed in the Company s financial statements as investments and valuation allowances taken against respective investments. The projections are based on the best estimates available,
however these estimates are subject to potential changes in market conditions, interest rates and market liquidity
considerations. 

6 

Going Concern: Management relies on estimates of projections
to support the going concern assumption and relies on the basis that the Company will continue to be financially supported by related
party entities until such time as the Company generates sufficient cashflow to support its expense requirements or completes an external
capital raising.

prejudice proceedings.

expenses of Timothy Cook for the period to December 2023. This amount is estimated to be 46,800.

of Newpoint Financial Corp. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Newpoint Financial Corp. (the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the
related statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then
ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has no revenue, has generated net losses during the current and preceding years, and has an
accumulated deficit of 1,872,038 as of December 31, 2022, all of which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on receiving continued support from related companies,
raising capital and generating revenue from operations. Management s evaluation of these events and conditions and its plans regarding
those matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to those charged with governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to
the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the
critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they
relate. 

Valuation
of Investment in Common Stock and Allowance for Credit Facility Receivable 

As
discussed in notes 4 and 5 to the financial statements, the Company owns shares of common stock in a privately held company and has also
entered into a credit facility agreement to provide funding to this company for which it has a credit facility receivable as of December
31, 2022. In connection therewith, the 2022 financial statements reflect an impairment of the investment and a valuation allowance against
the receivable. 

We
identified management s determination with regard to the valuation of the Company s investment in the common stock of the
privately held entity, along with management s evaluation as to the realizability and collectability of the credit facility receivable
as a critical audit matter because of (1) the lack of readily determinable market information available to value the investment in the
common shares; (2) the limited financial data and information that was available to management to assess the financial net worth and
resources of the company to repay the receivable; and (3) the inherently subjective nature of management s judgement as to establishing
an appropriate carrying value for the investment and the collectability of the receivable. These matters required significant audit effort
to assess, and a high degree of auditor judgement to evaluate, the reasonableness of management s estimates related to its determination
as to the net carrying amount of the investment in common stock and the credit facility receivable as of December 31, 2022. 

Management s
evaluation and determination of the fair value of the Company s investment in the common stock of a privately held company and
judgment as to any potential impairment of such investment, along with the determination of a valuation allowance of the credit facility
receivable for the same privately held company requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the relevant
investment valuation and receivable allowance amounts. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates
and assumptions was complex and required a high degree of auditor judgement. 

Our
audit procedures to address these matters included the following: 

Evaluated management s
 assessment and analysis which resulted in a full valuation of the investment in common stock and the allowance for the credit facility
 receivable as of December 31, 2022. 

Obtained and reviewed the
 terms of the contractual agreements between the Company and the privately held company regarding the common stock holding and the
 amounts loaned by the Company under the credit facility. 

Requested from management
 available financial information for the privately held company and evaluated the nature, completeness and timeliness of the information
 provided. 

Obtained confirmation from
 the privately held company as to the amount owed to the Company as of December 31, 2022. 

Assessed and evaluated
 the appropriateness of the disclosures included in the Company s financial statements.

OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders of Newpoint Financial Corp. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Newpoint Financial Corp. (the Company) as of December 31, 2021, and the related statements
of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31,
2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described
in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has no revenues, has incurred net losses during the current and preceding years, and
has an accumulated deficit of 532,090 as of December 31, 2021. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
on raising capital and ultimately achieving profitable operations. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described
in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated
or required to be communicated to the board of directors and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

We
determined the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is a critical audit matter due to the estimation and uncertainty
regarding the Company s available capital and the risk of bias in management s judgments and assumptions in their determination. 

 Our
audit procedures related to the Company s assertion on its ability to continue as a going concern included the following: 

We
 performed testing procedures such as analytical procedures to identify conditions and events that indicated there was substantial
 doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

We
 reviewed and evaluated management s plans for dealing with the adverse effects of these conditions and events. 

We
 inquired of Company management and reviewed Company records to assess whether there are additional factors that contribute to the
 uncertainties disclosed. 

We
 assessed whether the Company s determination that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern
 was adequately disclosed.

best estimates of the current risk factors involved. These risk factors remain elevated given the lack of clarity regarding the future
projections for Novea. 

On
August 20, 2021, we entered into a Class A Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Citadel Risk Holdings, Inc. CRHI ). Under
the purchase agreement, the Company agreed to purchase from CRHI shares of Class A Common Stock of CRHI, over a ten year period,

The
Company s net operating loss carry forwards was

there is no current tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

The
net increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was 
 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company
evaluates its valuation allowance on an annual basis based on projected future operations. When circumstances change and this causes
a change in management s judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets, the impact of the change on the valuation allowance
is reflected in current operations.

We
did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for the year ended December 31, 2022 or December
31, 2021 due to the operating losses experienced during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. When it is more likely
than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through future income the Company must allow for this future tax benefit. We provided a
full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset, consisting of net operating loss carry forwards, because management has determined
that it is more likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carry forward period.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC defines the term disclosure controls and procedures to mean a company s
controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that
it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its chief executive and chief financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company
maintains such a system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required to disclose in the
reports it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC s
rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to its chief executive officer to allow
timely decisions regarding disclosure. 

9 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The
management of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and related financial information appearing
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The management of the Company is also responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and l5d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A
company s internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our
assets; 

Provide
reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance
with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and
directors; and 

Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Management,
including the Chief Executive Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent
all error and all fraud. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further,
over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. 

Management
has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based upon the
framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
2013 Framework. Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company had material weaknesses
in its internal control over financial reporting. 

Specifically,
management identified the following material weaknesses at December 31, 2022: 

As of December
31, 2022 there were material weaknesses in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting with regard to properly classifying
expenses to the appropriate expense accounts and in determining whether certain expenses were reimbursable from related party entities,
as well as in capturing and recording all year-end liabilities as part of its cut off procedures. 

As of December 31, 2022, there was a lack of segregation of duties, in that we had an insufficient amount of people to support the
payment function and respective accounting-related duties. 

As of December 31, 2022, there were no independent directors and no independent audit committee. 

As a result of the material weakness described above, management has concluded
that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting, involving the preparation and reporting
of our financial statements presented in conformity with GAAP, were not effective. 

We
understand that remediation of material weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls is a continuing work in progress due to the
issuance of new standards and promulgations. However, remediation of any known deficiency is among our highest priorities. Our management
will periodically assess the progress and sufficiency of our ongoing initiatives and make adjustments as and when practical and necessary. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of
the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report.

Section
145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a corporation may indemnify directors and officers as well as other employees
and individuals against expenses including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
various actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative other than an action by or in the right
of the corporation, a derivative action, if they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, if they had no reasonable cause to
believe their conduct was unlawful. A similar standard is applicable in the case of derivative actions, except that indemnification only
extends to expenses including attorneys fees incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such actions, and the statute
requires court approval before there can be any indemnification where the person seeking indemnification has been found liable to the
corporation. The statute provides that it is not exclusive of other indemnification that may be granted by a corporation s certificate
of incorporation, bylaws, agreement, a vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

Company s bylaws provides that it will indemnify, to the extent permitted by its certificate of incorporation, its officers and
directors and, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, may indemnify its employees and agents.

any
 breach of the director s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders; 

acts
 or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law 

payments
 of unlawful dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; or

 transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. 

The
Company s Certificate of Incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, none of our directors
will be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Any repeal or modification

of stockholders. A vote by the holders of a majority of the Company s outstanding shares is required to effectuate certain fundamental
corporate changes such as a merger or an amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation. 

Holders
of the Company s common stock are entitled to share in an dividends that the Board of Directors, in its discretion, declares from
lega11y available funds. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each outstanding share entitles its holder to participate
pro rata in all assets that remain after payment of liabilities and after providing for each class of stock, if any, having preference
over the common stock. The Company s common stock has no pre-emptive rights, no conversion rights, and there are no redemption
provisions applicable to the Company s common stock.
