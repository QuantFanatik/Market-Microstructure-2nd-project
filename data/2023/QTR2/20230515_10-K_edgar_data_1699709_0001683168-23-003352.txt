PART I 

Item 1. Business 

The Company was incorporated as Soldino Group
Corp. on January 25, 2017 under the laws of the State of Nevada, United States of America. On November 15, 2018, the Company changed its
name to Yijia Group Corp. The Company is in good standing in the State of Nevada and in any jurisdiction where it is qualified to do business. 

Starting from July 30, 2021, the Company commenced
its operation in the rendering of business consulting service to domestic and international customers. The Company provides consulting
services to its clients with regards to funding and other financial matters. 

Revenue Stream 

 The Company currently earns revenues from monthly
consulting fees received from its two consulting clients. 

The terms of the Company s consulting agreements
are separately negotiated depending on the scope of the consulting services requested. 

Consulting Agreements 

 On July 30, 2021, the Company entered into a consulting
agreement, effective August 2, 2021, with Care 365 LLC. The term of the consulting agreements is for an initial term of three months.
Unless terminated in writing prior to the end of the period, the consulting agreement shall renew for successive three month periods by
either party. During the term of the consulting agreement, the Company shall receive a monthly consulting fee of 10,000. 

On July 30, 2021, the Company entered into a
consulting agreement, effective August 2, 2021, with SBV Workforce Management. The term of the consulting agreements is for an
initial term of three months. Unless terminated in writing prior to the end of the period, the consulting agreement shall renew for
successive three month periods by either party. During the term of the consulting agreement, the Company shall receive a monthly
consulting fee of 5,000. 

Market Strategy 

 The business consulting service industry is highly
competitive. The Company will utilize the past business experience and relationships developed by its sole officer and director to identify
and pursue new consulting opportunities. 

Number of Employees 

 Other than our sole officer, the Company currently
has no full-time employees. We currently have people ready to fill positions as soon as they are needed in both office staff and work
force roles. 

Research and Development 

 We have not incurred any research and development
costs in the fiscal years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022. 

Insurance 

 We do not maintain insurance and do not intend
to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have insurance, if we are made a party to any action, we may not have sufficient
funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations. 

Government Regulation 

 We will be required to comply with all regulations,
rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to export and import of work wear and operation of any facility
in any jurisdiction in which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that government regulation will have a material impact on
the way we conduct our business. We do not need to receive any government approvals to conduct our business. However, we will have to
comply with all applicable export and import regulations should we recommence our operations.

Market Information 

 During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023,
our common stock was quoted on the OTC under the symbol YJGJ with no bid and no trading of our common stock. There can be no assurance
that a public trading market will develop or be sustained in the future. Without an active public trading market, you may not be able
to liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. If a market does develop, the price for our securities may be highly volatile
and may bear no relationship to our actual financial condition or results of operations. The many risks associated with an investment
in our company, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. Also, because there is no price for our common
stock, many brokerage firms may not affect transactions in the common stock. 

Number of Holders 

 As of May 2, 2023, 5,871,250 issued and outstanding
shares of common stock were held by a total of seven shareholders of record. 

Dividends 

 No cash dividends were paid on our shares of common
stock during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023. 

Transfer Agent and Registrar 

 The transfer agent and registrar for
the Company s common stock is Action Stock Transfer Corporation at 2469 E. Fort Union Blvd, Suite 214 Salt Lake City, UT 84121.
The telephone number is: (801) 274-1088. 

Equity Compensation Plan Information 

 We do not have any equity compensation plans and
accordingly we have no shares authorized for issuance under an equity compensation plan. 

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 

 We did not sell any equity securities which were
not registered under the Securities Act during the year ended April 30, 2023 that were not otherwise disclosed on our quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q or our current reports on Form 8-K filed during the year ended April 30, 2023. 

Purchase of our Equity Securities by Officers
and Directors 

 We did not purchase any of our shares of common
stock or other securities during our fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended April 30, 2023. 

Other Stockholder Matters 

 None. 

Item 6. Selected Financial Data

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Forward-looking statements 

 Statements made in this Form 10-K that are not
historical or current facts are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 (the Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified
by the use of terms such as may, will, expect, believe, anticipate, estimate, 
 approximate or continue, or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to
the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future.
However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual
results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected.
We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 

Financial information contained in this report
and in our financial statements is stated in United States dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles. 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. Some of the information contained
in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for
our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. 

We qualify as an emerging growth company 
under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long
as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; provide an auditor attestation with respect to management s report on the
effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting; comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional
information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); submit certain executive compensation
matters to shareholders advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency and disclose certain executive
compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation
to median employee compensation. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage
of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. 

We have elected to take advantage of the benefits
of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such
new or revised accounting standards. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest
of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed 1 billion, (ii) the date that we become
a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market
value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed
second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three
year period. Even if we no longer qualify for the exemptions for an emerging growth company, we may still be, in certain circumstances,
subject to scaled disclosure requirements as a smaller reporting company. For example, smaller reporting companies, like emerging growth
companies, are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis under Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K or auditor attestation
of internal controls over financial reporting.

Going Concern 

 The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company incurred a net loss of 24,227 for the year ended April 30, 2023 and an accumulated
deficit of 123,910. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Results of operations 

 Currently, we commenced our operation in the rendering
of business consulting service to domestic and international customers. On July 30, 2021, we entered into two consulting agreements with
non-affiliates to provide business consulting services. Under the consulting agreements, we receive consulting fees of 5,000 and 10,000
per month, respectively. The initial term of the consulting agreements was for an initial three months period. Unless terminated
in writing prior to the end of the period, the consulting agreements automatically renew every three months. As of April 30, 2023, the
consulting agreements have not been terminated. 

Prior
to these consulting agreements, we were a shell company (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange
Act). As of July 31, 2021, the Company was no longer a shell company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Since the date of these consulting agreements, the Company is reporting more than nominal revenue in its periodic
reports. 

We expect we will require additional capital to
meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt
securities.

Operating expenses 

 We incurred operating expenses of 62,227 and
 133,367 for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These operating expenses consisted primarily of costs relating to
the registration of the Company s common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission and ongoing reporting costs,

 We reported a net income of 24,227 for the year
ended April 30, 2023, while we incurred a net income of 139,682 for the year ended April 30, 2022. 

Liquidity and capital resources 

 As of April 30, 2023 and 2022, our total assets

As of April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2022, we had
cash and cash equivalents of 8,728 and 0, respectively. 

We have never paid dividends on our Common Stock.
Our present policy is to apply cash to investments in product development, acquisitions or expansion; consequently, we do not expect to
pay dividends on Common Stock in the foreseeable future.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

For the year ended April 30, 2023, we have not
generated positive cash flows from operating activities. Net cash flows used in operating activities was 18,375, which primarily consisted
of a net loss of 24,227 and an increase in accrued liabilities and other payables of 5,852. 

For the year ended April 30, 2022, net cash flow
provided by operating activities was 4,061, which primarily consisted of a net income of 139,682 and an increase in accrued liabilities
and other payables of 17,428, offset by a gain from forgiveness of related party debts of 153,049. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

For the year ended April 30, 2023, net cash flow
provided by financing activities was 4,000 from the proceeds from a related party. 

For the year ended April 30, 2022, net cash flow
provided by financing activities was 19,042 from the proceeds from a related party. 

Our cash balance is 8,728 as of April 30, 2023.
We believe our cash balance is insufficient to fund our operations for any period of time. Management anticipates that the Company will
be dependent, in the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself
so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances
that the Company will be successful. 

Limited operating history; need for additional
capital 

There is no historical financial information about
us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in a start-up stage of operations and have generated limited revenues since
inception. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the
establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases
in services and products. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and shareholders of
Yijia Group Corp. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Yijia Group Corp (the Company as of April 30, 2023, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity,
and cash flows for the year ended April 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). 

In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the year ended April 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Consideration of the Company s Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company had
loss from operations of 24,227 for the year ended April 30, 2023, and a net working capital deficiency of 59,215 as of April 30, 2023,
these factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters
are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern without future profitability. Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent,
in the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it will
be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. 

In light of management s efforts, there
are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going
concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets
and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to
the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern.

In April 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, which
included Topic 260 Earnings Per Share . This guidance clarifies and reduces diversity in an issuer s accounting
for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options due to a lack of explicit guidance in the FASB Codification.
The ASU 2021-04 is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2021-04 on its financial statements.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation
of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled
reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based
on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred
income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of April 30, 2023 and 2022. All tax years since
inception remains open for examination only by taxing authorities of US Federal and state of Nevada. 

The Company has a net operating loss carryforward
for tax purposes totaling and as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, expiring through 2041. There is a limitation on the amount
of taxable income that can be offset by carryforwards after a change in control (generally greater than a 50 change in ownership). Temporary
differences, which give rise to a net deferred tax asset, are as follows:

Item 9A Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

 The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Company s Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The Company s management, with the participation
of our principal executive and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial
officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective. 

Management s Report on Internal Controls
over Financial Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and
with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023 using the criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tread way
Commission COSO ). 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies
that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

1. 
 We do not have an Audit Committee While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities. 

2. 
 We did not maintain appropriate cash controls As of April 30, 2023, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company s bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in their bank accounts. 

3. 
 We did not implement appropriate information technology controls As at April 30, 2023, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. 

21 

Accordingly, the Company concluded that these
control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company s internal controls. 

As a result of the material weaknesses described
above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30,
2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 

System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

 Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that
is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of April 30, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

 There was no change in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting during the quarterly period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Inc., a public company from 2008 to 2001. Mr. Sytner obtained a bachelor of arts degree in education from Yeshiva College in 1971 and
from the University of Scranton in 1973. 

Family Relationship 

 There are no family relationships between any
of our directors, executive officers and proposed directors or executive officers. 

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 

 To the best of our knowledge, our director and
executive officer has not, during the past ten years: 

1. 
 been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offences); 

2. 
 had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or business association of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years prior to that time; 

3. 
 been subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his involvement in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment, banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity; 

4. 
 been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated; 

5. 
 been the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated (not including any settlement of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or 

6. 
 been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29)), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 

23 

Compliance with Section 16(A) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 

 Our common stock is not registered pursuant to
Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Accordingly, our executive officers and
directors and persons who own more than 10 of a registered class of our equity securities are not subject to the beneficial ownership
reporting requirements of Section 16(1) of the Exchange Act. 

Board Committees 

 We have not yet established Compensation, Audit,
and Nominations and Corporate Governance committees nor do we have an Audit Committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of
Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act. Currently, the functions of these committees are performed by our entire Board of
Directors. We hope to establish these committees and appoint an Audit Committee financial expert as our business develops. 

Code of Ethics 

 We have not adopted a Code of Business Conduct
and Ethics. 

Corporate Governance 

 There have been no changes in any state law or
other procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. In addition to having no nominating committee
for this purpose, we currently have no specific audit committee and no audit committee financial expert. Based on the fact that our current
business affairs are simple, any such committees are excessive and beyond the scope of our business and needs. 

Directorships 

 None 

Indemnification 

 The Company shall indemnify to the fullest extent
permitted by, and in the manner permissible under the laws of the State of Nevada, any person made, or threatened to be made, a party

or officer of the Company, or served any other enterprise as director, officer or employee at the request of the Company.

Changes in Control 

 There are no present arrangements or pledges of
our securities that may result in a change in control of the Company. 

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions, and Director Independence. 

The Company has been provided free office space
by its stockholder. The management determined that such cost is nominal and did not recognize the rent expense in its financial statements. 

From time to time, the stockholder and director
of the Company advanced funds to the Company for working capital purpose. Those advances are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on
demand. 

25 

Apart from the transactions and balances detailed
elsewhere in these accompanying financial statements, the Company has no other significant or material related party transactions during
the years presented. 

Director Independence 

 We have adopted standards for director independence
that correspond to NASDAQ listing standards and SEC rules. An independent director means a person who is not an officer
or employee of the Company or its subsidiaries, or any other individual having a relationship that, in the opinion of the Board, would
interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. To be considered independent,
the Board must affirmatively determine that neither the director, nor any member of his or her immediate family, has had any direct or
indirect material relationship with the Company within the previous three years. In addition, to be considered independent 
under SEC rules, each member of the Audit Committee may not accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory
fee from us, other than compensation for his or her services as a director. 

The Board considered relationships, transactions
and/or arrangements with each of the directors and concluded that none of the non-employee directors, or any of his or her immediate family
members, has any relationship with us that would impair his or her independence. The Board has determined that each member of the Board,
is not an independent director under applicable NASDAQ listing standards and SEC rules. 

Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services 

Our Board of Directors has not yet adopted pre-approval
policies and procedures but considers all matters brought before it. We expect to adopt such policies and procedures after the formation
of our Audit Committee. 

The aggregate professional fees paid to our registered
public accounting firm for its annual audit and quarterly reviews during the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:
