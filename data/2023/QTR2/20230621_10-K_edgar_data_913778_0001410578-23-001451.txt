Table of Contents 
 Description of Business The Fund s principal business is to invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (the Operating Partnerships each of which will own or lease and will operate an apartment complex exclusively or partially for low- and moderate-income tenants. Each Operating Partnership in which the Fund invests owns apartment complexes, which are completed, newly-constructed, under construction or rehabilitation, or to-be constructed or rehabilitated, and which are expected to receive government assistance. Each apartment complex is expected to qualify for the low-income housing tax credit under Section 42 of the Code (the Federal Housing Tax Credit ), providing tax benefits over a period of ten to twelve years in the form of tax credits which investors may use to offset income, subject to certain strict limitations, from other sources. Some apartment complexes may also qualify for the historic rehabilitation tax credit under Section 47 of the Code (the Rehabilitation Tax Credit ). Section 236 (f) (ii) of the National Housing Act, as amended, and Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended, each provide for the making by HUD of rent supplement payments to low income tenants in properties which receive other forms of federal assistance such as tax credits. The payments for each tenant, which are made directly to the owner of their property, generally are in such amounts as to enable the tenant to pay rent equal to 30 of the adjusted family income. Some of the apartment complexes in which the Fund has invested are receiving their rent supplements from HUD. HUD has been in the process of converting rent supplement assistance to assistance paid not to the owner of the apartment complex, but directly to the individuals. At this time, the Fund is unable to predict whether Congress will continue rent supplement programs payable directly to owners of apartment complexes. As of March 31, 2023 the Fund had invested in 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 20, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 21, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 22, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 23, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 24, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 25, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 26, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 27, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 28, 1 Operating Partnership on behalf of Series 29, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 30, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 31, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 32, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 33, 1 Operating Partnership on behalf of Series 34, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 35, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 36, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 37, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 38, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 39, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 40, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 41, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 42, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 43, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 44, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 45 and 3 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 46. A description of these Operating Partnerships is set forth in Item 2 herein. The business objectives of the Fund are to: (1) Provide current tax benefits to investors in the form of Federal Housing Tax Credits and, in limited instances, a small amount of Rehabilitation Tax Credits, which an investor may apply, subject to strict limitations, against the investor s federal income tax liability from active, portfolio and passive income; (2) Preserve and protect the Fund s capital and provide capital appreciation and cash distributions through increases in value of the Fund s investments and, to the extent applicable, equity buildup through periodic payments on the mortgage indebtedness with respect to the apartment complexes; (3) Provide tax benefits in the form of passive losses which an investor may apply to offset his passive income (if any); and (4) Provide cash distributions (except with respect to the Fund s investment in some non-profit Operating Partnerships) from capital transaction proceeds. The Operating Partnerships intend to hold the apartment complexes for appreciation in value. The Operating Partnerships may sell the apartment complexes after a period of time if financial conditions in the future make such sales desirable and if such sales are permitted by government restrictions. Employees The Fund does not have any employees. Services are performed by the general partner and its affiliates and agents retained by them.

Table of Contents 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors As used in this Item 1A, references to we, us and our mean the Fund. An investment in our BACs and our investments in Operating Partnerships are subject to risks. These risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in our BACs, and the amount of proceeds available for distribution to our limited partners, if any, on liquidation of our investments. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business operations. The ability of limited partners to claim tax losses from their investment in us is limited. The IRS may audit us or an Operating Partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items. The amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits and tax losses allocable to the investors could be reduced if the IRS were successful in such a challenge. The alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in our BACs. Changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in our BACs and/or the value of the Operating Partnerships. Until the Operating Partnerships have completed a mandatory fifteen year Low Income Housing Tax Credit compliance period, investors are at risk for potential recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that have already been claimed. The Low Income Housing Tax Credits rules are extremely complicated and noncompliance with these rules may have adverse consequences for BAC holders. Noncompliance with applicable tax regulations may result in the loss of future Low Income Housing Tax Credits and the fractional recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits already taken. In most cases the annual amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that an individual can use is limited to the tax liability due on the person s last 25,000 of taxable income. The Operating Partnerships may be sold at a price which would not result in our realizing cash distributions or proceeds from the transaction. Accordingly, we may be unable to distribute any cash to our investors. Low Income Housing Tax Credits may be the only benefit from an investment in our BACs. Poor performance of one housing complex, or the real estate market generally, could impair our ability to satisfy our investment objectives. Each housing complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness. If an Operating Partnership failed to pay its mortgage, it could lose its housing complex in foreclosure. If foreclosure were to occur during the first 15 years of the existence of the Fund, the loss of any remaining future Low Income Housing Tax Credits, a fractional recapture of previously claimed Low Income Housing Tax Credits, and a loss of our investment in the housing complex would occur. To the extent the Operating Partnerships receive government financing or operating subsidies, they may be subject to one or more of the following risks: - difficulties in obtaining rent increases; - limitations on cash distributions; - limitations on sales or refinancing of Operating Partnerships; - limitations on transfers of interests in Operating Partnerships; - limitations on removal of local general partners; - limitations on subsidy programs; and - possible changes in applicable regulations. The value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions, including employment rates, inflation, tax, environmental, land use and zoning policies, supply and demand of similar properties, and neighborhood conditions, among others.

 No trading market for the BACs exists or is expected to develop. There is currently no active trading market for the BACs. Accordingly, limited partners may be unable to sell their BACs or may have to sell BACs at a discount. Limited partners should consider their BACs to be a long-term investment. Investors may realize taxable gain on sale or disposition of BACs. Upon the sale or other taxable disposition of BACs, investors will realize taxable income to the extent that their allocable share of the non-recourse mortgage indebtedness on the apartment complexes, together with the money they receive from the sale of the BACs, is greater than the original cost of their BACs. This realized taxable income is reduced to the extent that investors have suspended passive losses or credits. It is possible that the sale of BACs may not generate enough cash to pay the tax obligations arising from the sale. Investors may have tax liability in excess of cash. Investors eventually may be allocated profits for tax purposes which exceed any cash distributed to them. For this tax liability, the investor will have to pay federal income tax without a corresponding cash distribution. Similarly, in the event of a sale or foreclosure of an apartment complex or a sale of BACs, an investor may be allocated taxable income, resulting in tax liability, in excess of any cash distributed to him or her as a result of such event. Investors may not receive cash if apartment complexes are sold . There is no assurance that investors will receive any cash distributions from the sale or refinancing of an apartment complex. The price at which an apartment complex is sold may not be large enough to pay the mortgage and other expenses which must be paid at such time. Even if there are net cash proceeds from a sale, expenses such as accrued Fund management fees and unpaid loans will be deducted pursuant to Section 4.02(a) of the Fund Agreement. If any of these events happen, investors will not get all of their investment back, and the only benefit from an investment will be the tax credits received. The sale or refinancing of the apartment complexes is dependent upon the following material factors: - The necessity of obtaining the consent of the operating general partners; - The necessity of obtaining the approval of any governmental agency(ies) providing government assistance to the apartment complex; and - The uncertainty of the market. Any sale may occur well after the fifteen-year federal housing tax credit compliance period. We have insufficient sources of cash to pay our existing liabilities. We currently do not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our financial liabilities. Furthermore, we do not anticipate that we will have sufficient available cash to pay our future financial liabilities. Substantially all of our existing liabilities are payable to our general partner and its affiliates. Though the amounts payable to the general partner and its affiliates are contractually currently payable, we do not believe that the general partner or its affiliates will demand immediate payment of these contractual obligations in the near term; however, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. We would be materially adversely affected if the general partner or its affiliates demanded payment in the near term of our existing contractual liabilities or suspended the provision of services to us because of our inability to satisfy these obligations. All monies currently deposited, or that will be deposited in the future, into the Fund s working capital reserves are intended to be utilized to pay our existing and future liabilities. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable.

 Item 2. Properties The Fund has acquired a limited partnership interest in 5 Operating Partnerships in 3 series, identified in the table set forth below. The apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships are eligible for the Federal Housing Tax Credit. Initial occupancy of a unit in each apartment complex which initially complied with the minimum set-aside test (i.e., initial occupancy by tenants with incomes equal to no more than a designated percentage of area median income) and the rent restriction test (i.e., gross rent charged tenants does not exceed 30 of the applicable income standards) is referred to as Qualified Occupancy. The Operating Partnerships and the respective apartment complexes are described more fully in the Prospectus. The general partner believes that there is adequate casualty insurance on the properties. Please refer to Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a more detailed discussion of operational difficulties experienced by certain of the Operating Partnerships.

Critical Accounting Estimates In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity VIE in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE. The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors. A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE. Further, the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Based on this guidance, management has determined that while the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE, the Operating Partnerships should not be consolidated with the Fund because the Fund does not have the power to direct the activities of the Operating Partnerships which are significant to their performance and is therefore not a primary beneficiary of the Operating Partnerships. The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements. The Fund s balance in investment in Operating Partnerships, advances made to

 Operating Partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on the investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss. The Fund s exposure to loss on these partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying housing complexes as well as the strength of the general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors of the Fund.

 As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Fund s general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of Corporate Investment Holdings Inc., carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole. Based on that evaluation, the Fund s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information relating to any series or the Fund as a whole required to be disclosed by it in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Fund s management, including the Fund s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole. (b) Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) of each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole. The Fund s internal control system over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Fund s management regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Due to inherent limitations, an internal control system over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Fund s and each series internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, management concluded the Fund s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2023 with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the General Partner BF Garden Tax Credit Fund IV L.P. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of BF Garden Tax Credit Fund IV L.P. Series 20 through 46 (collectively, the Partnership ), in total and for each series, as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related statements of operations, changes in partners capital (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership, in total and for each series, as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal security laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits of the financial statements provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to those charged with governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. We have served as the Partnership s auditor since 1994.

 NOTE A - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Investments in Operating Limited Partnerships (Continued) years on the straight-line method. Certain operating limited partnerships have not recorded the acquisition costs as a capital contribution from the fund. These differences are shown as reconciling items in note C. As of January 1, 1999, the Fund records acquisition costs incurred after January 1, 1999 as deferred acquisition costs. These costs are amortized on the straight-line method. In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE. A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party is required to consolidate the VIE. The Fund determines whether an entity is a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary at the date of initial involvement with the entity. The Fund reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on changes in facts and circumstances. In determining whether it is the primary beneficiary, the Partnership considers the purpose and activities of the VIE, including the variability and related risks the VIE incurs and transfers to other entities and their related parties. These factors are considered in determining whether the Fund has the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and whether the Fund also has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE. If the Fund determines that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE is consolidated within the Partnership s financial statements.
