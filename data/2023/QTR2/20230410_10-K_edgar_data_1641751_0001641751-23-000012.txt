1. BUSINESS

In

(the Merger Agreement and completed a merger, whereby Brewbilt merged with and into Vet Online Supply, with BrewBilt remaining

Jeffrey

years of experience managing engineering, design, and fabrication teams that custom design and fabricate integrated stainless-steel distillation
and brewing systems for the beverage, cannabis and hemp industries. 

Our
Market Opportunity 

The
craft beer industry offers a value of 94.1 billion in the United States, yet it is still an area of the economy which offers growth
potential. As the craft beer market matures, the smaller players are being squeezed out, and the more established breweries are consolidating
and gaining market share. 

In
response to this industry trend, BrewBilt is shifting our marketing focus to larger brewing systems that are in higher demand as these
successful breweries expand their production volumes with bigger equipment. These targeted customers are less price sensitive than the
small startups and more willing to pay top dollar for the quality and reliability that BrewBilt is known for in the craft beer industry. 

BrewBilt
systems are engineered for high efficiency and consistency, which are critical factors for regional breweries and microbreweries, which
make up for 66 and 19 of US craft beer production, respectively. 

4 

There
are five distinct craft beer industry market segments: regional brewers, microbreweries, brewpubs, taprooms, and contract brewers. 

Essential
Craft Beer Industry Statistics 

As
of the writing of this information, 2022 industry numbers have not been released. 

California
had the largest output for the craft beer industry in 2021, offering 10.7 billion in total impact. Pennsylvania finished in second during
the year, with a 6.1 billion impact. They were followed by Texas 5.9 billion), New York 5.4 billion), and Florida 4.2 billion).
 The overall beer market in the United States has a value of 103.5 billion. Although the craft
beer segment has a 12.3 share of the total beer volume in the country, it represents 23.6 of the total dollar sales that were achieved
in 2021. The dollar sales of craft beer products in the United States was down 12 in 2020, which was a result of pandemic sales
being shifted from taprooms to retail for at-home consumption. However, on-site sales are already rebounding strongly in 2022. Adults
in the United States consume an average of 19.8 gallons of beer each year, according to the National Beer Wholesalers Association. About
36 of registered breweries in the United States are listed as a brewpub. That means the products they create for consumers are meant
for direct sales that occur on their premises. The average brewery with this classification will produce about 1,000 barrels of beer
each year. 95 of the breweries which are operating in the United States today produced less than 15,000 barrels of beer each year. That
classifies the operation as a microbrewery if 75 or more of the beer the company produces is sold off-site. About 40 of the sales that
occur each year for the craft beer industry happen during the months of June, July, or August. Almost 90 of adults over the age of 21
in the United States live within 10 miles of at least one brewery. Most of these operations qualify as a craft beer producer. There are
more than 950 different craft breweries operating in California right now, making it the largest source of products for the industry
today.

Overall
U.S. beer volume sales were up 10 in 2021, while craft brewer volume sales showed similar increase of 10 , small and independent brewers

Competition 

BrewBilt
competes against a number of companies, most of which are selling mass produced equipment from China made from less costly, inferior
quality Chinese steel which often is not food grade quality. While this broader market is very competitive, there continues to be little
competition and strong market demand for higher quality, custom designed, hand-crafted systems that BrewBilt produces with American labor. 

Employees
and Consultants 

As
of the date of this filing, BrewBilt has 15 employees. Our suppliers include various consultants for manufacturing, new business development
and marketing, in addition to legal and accounting support.

2. PROPERTIES

January 2018, BrewBilt began leasing an eight thousand square foot manufacturing facility located at 110 Spring Hill Dr #10, Grass Valley,
CA 95945. 

ITEM
3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The
Company was served a complaint in the County of Nevada, State of California (Case No. CU0000567). BrewBilt Manufacturing Inc. is listed
as a named defendant in this matter. The complaint involves the termination of employee Branford Samuels who was employed as a fabricator
for BrewBilt Manufacturing Inc. and California Rules of Court rule 3.110(b) states in relevant part that, [t]he complaint must
be served on all named defendants and proofs of service on those defendants must be filed with the court within 60 days of filing of
the complaint. The subject complaint was filed by plaintiff on February 7, 2023. Therefore, at this time it is speculative whether
the Company has any threat of material litigation or pending material litigation. Although though the underlying events giving rising
to the claim/cause of action occurred prior to the date of December 31, 2022, at this time, it is our current opinion that there are
no unasserted possible claims or assessments of such that are probable as it relates to the Company. In other words, with facts known
to us at this time, we opine that it is not probable (Standard 8(a)) that there are assertable legal claims against the
Company that must be disclosed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 as they do not also likely satisfy
Standard 8(b): The amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.

Penny
Stock Regulations Restrictions on Marketability 

The
SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally
equity securities with a market price of less than 5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or
quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided
by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a
standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market
for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading, (b) contains a description of the broker s or dealer s duties to the
customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of
the securities laws, (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks
and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price, (d) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary
actions, (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks, and (f) contains such
other information and is in such form, including language, type size and format, as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation. 

The
broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with (a) bid and offer quotations
for the penny stock, (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, (c) the number of shares to which
such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock, and
(d) a monthly account statement showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. 

In
addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer
must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s
written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement as to transactions involving penny stocks,
and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. 

These
disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity for our common stock once we obtain a listing on a regulated
market. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares of our common stock.

ITEM
7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).

Results
for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Revenues: 

The
Company s revenues were 1,435,844 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 774,388 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Of the total revenues, 1,087,234 was from related party BrewBilt Brewing. The increase is due to the majority of the BrewBilt Brewing
job being completed and delivered in the second and third quarter of 2022. 

Cost
of Sales: 

The
Company s cost of materials was 1,038,746 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 419,098 for the year ended December
31, 2021. The overall increase is due to the BrewBilt Brewing job that was completed in 2022. The increase in costs in relation to revenue
in 2021 was due to an increase in raw material costs as a result of supply chain issues and the continuing impact of COVID-19. In addition,
the company also had a higher number of smaller customer orders with low profit margins. COVID-19 related safety measures also resulted
in a reduction of manufacturing productivity during the year ended December 31, 2021. 

10 

Operating
Expenses : 

Operating
expenses consisted primarily of consulting fees, professional fees, salaries and wages, office expenses and fees associated with preparing
reports and SEC filings relating to being a public company. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31,
2021 were 4,075,503 and 7,661,953, respectively. Although the company had a significant increase in G A expenses in 2022, the decrease
in overall expenses was due to a reduction in share-based salaries and wages and consulting fees during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Other
Income (Expense) : 

Other
income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was (3,807,481) and (4,390,446), respectively. Other income (expense)
consisted of gain or loss on derivative valuation, gain or loss on disposal of assets, loss on conversions, debt forgiveness and interest
expense. The gain or loss on derivative valuation is directly attributable to the change in fair value of the derivative liability. Interest
expense is primarily attributable the initial interest expense associated with the valuation of derivative instruments at issuance and
the accretion of the convertible debentures over their respective terms. The fluctuation of the Company s stock price impacted
the valuation of the derivative liabilities on the convertible debt, which resulted in an increase in 2022. However, the company had
a decrease in loss of conversion of debt and an increase in debt settlement and debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31,
2022. 

Net
Loss: 

Net
loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 7,485,886 compared with 11,697,109 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decreased
loss can be explained by the decrease in share-based salaries and an increase in other income during in the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2022,
the Company has a shareholders deficit of 17,567,037 since its inception, working capital deficit of 4,200,956, negative cash
flows from operations, and has limited business operations, which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as going concern. The ability of the Company to meet its commitments as they become payable is dependent on the ability of the Company
to obtain necessary financing or achieving a profitable level of operations. There is no assurance the Company will be successful in
achieving these goals.

The
overall working capital (deficit) increased from (3,085,906) at December 31, 2021 to (4,200,956) at December 31, 2022 due to an increase
in accrued liabilities, notes payable and derivative liabilities. 

The
Company requires additional capital to fully execute its marketing program and increase revenues. Presently we are relying on short term
loans from our sole officer and director to meet operational shortfalls. There can be no assurance that continued funding will be available
on satisfactory terms. We intend to raise additional capital through the sale of equity, loans, or other short-term financing options.

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in operating activities was 385,493 compared to 1,187,502 for the year ended December 31,
2021. The variance primarily resulted from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities, an increase in operating assets and a
decrease in operating liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in investing activities was 0 compared to 185,289 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The variance in cash used in investing activity is due to a decrease in fixed assets purchases and disposals in the year ended December
31, 2022. 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022, cash from financing activities was 278,396 compared to 1,519,210 for the year ended December 31,
2021. The decrease in cash from financing activity is due to a decrease in proceeds from convertible debt, an increase in payments made
to convertible debt and long-term debt that was extinguished during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 

Significant
Accounting Policies 

Our
discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related
to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, warranty liabilities, share-based payments, income taxes and litigation. We
base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under
the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent
degree of uncertainty. Actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results
and financial position. We believe that the significant accounting policies and assumptions as detailed in Note 1 to the financial statements
contained herein may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others. 

Emerging
Growth Company 

We
qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions
from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: 

have
 an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 

comply
 with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation
 or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e.,
 an auditor discussion and analysis); 

submit
 certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; 
 and 

12 

disclose
 certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons
 of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period
provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable
to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal
year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed 1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer 
as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that
is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii)
the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BrewBilt Manufacturing, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related
statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company s significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
management s opinion, the fair value of convertible notes payable and advances payable is approximate to carrying value as the
interest rates and other features of these instruments approximate those obtainable for similar instruments in the current market. Unless
otherwise noted, it is management s opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, exchange or credit risks arising
from these financial instruments. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the balances reported for cash, accounts receivable,
prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, approximate the fair value because of their short maturities. 

since its inception, working capital deficit of , negative cash
flows from operations, and has limited business operations, which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as going concern. The ability of the Company to meet its commitments as they become payable is dependent on the ability of the Company
to obtain necessary financing or achieving a profitable level of operations. There is no assurance the Company will be successful in
achieving these goals. 

The

is recognized over the expected term on a straight-line basis. Operating leases are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets,

new standard also provides practical expedients and certain exemptions for an entity s ongoing accounting. We have elected the
short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. This means, for those leases where the initial lease term is one
year or less or for which the ROU asset at inception is deemed immaterial, we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities. Those
leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

There
are no changes in or disagreements with accountants on accounting and/or financial disclosure. 

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, under supervision and with the participation of the Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon this
evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, because of the material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting ICFR described below, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that required information to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that required information to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 14d-14(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. 

All
internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial reporting reliability and
financial statement preparation and presentation. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. 

39 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making the assessment, management
used the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework 2013. Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting
was not effective and that material weaknesses in ICFR existed as more fully described below. 

As
defined by Auditing Standard No. 5, An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that is Integrated with an Audit of
Financial Statements established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB ), a material weakness is
a deficiency or combination of deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with the assessment described above, management identified the
following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses as of December 31, 2022: 

1)
 
 Lack
of an independent audit committee or audit committee financial expert, and no independent directors. We do not have any members of the
Board who are independent directors and we do not have an audit committee. We have a single officer and director. These factors may be
counter to corporate governance practices as defined by the various stock exchanges and may lead to less supervision over management; 

2)
 
 Insufficient
 written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP
 and SEC disclosure requirements; 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

As
of December 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation,
it was concluded that during the period covered by this report, the internal controls and procedures were not effective due to deficiencies
that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting. However, management believes these weaknesses
did not have an effect on our financial results. During the course of our evaluation, we did not discover any fraud involving management
or any other personnel who play a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting. 

Due
to a lack of financial and personnel resources, we are not able to, and do not intend to, immediately take any action to remediate these
material weaknesses. We will not be able to do so until, if ever, we acquire sufficient financing and staff to do so. We will implement
further controls as circumstances, cash flow, and working capital permits. Notwithstanding the assessment that our ICFR was not effective
and that there were material weaknesses as identified in this report, we believe that our financial statements contained in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2022, fairly presents our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows
for the periods covered, as identified, in all material respects. 

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth above were the result of the scale of our operations and intrinsic to our small size.
Management also believes that these weaknesses did not have an effect on our financial results. 

This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report
in this annual report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the period covered by this report, there were no changes (including corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses) in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Biographical
Information 

Mr.
Jeffrey Lewis 

Jeffrey
Lewis is 49 years old. As the founder of BrewBilt Manufacturing, LLC, a multiple million-dollar sales and manufacturing company, he has
15+ years of experience managing engineering, design and fabrication teams that custom design and fabricate integrated stainless-steel
distillation and brewing systems for the beverage, pharmaceutical, cannabis and hemp industries. Mr. Lewis has been a part of the design
team which builds CBD cold-water and alcohol -based extraction systems in the US, and he will continue to drive his products into both
the cannabis and brewing markets. 

Mr.
Samuel L. Berry 

As
a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, Samuel Berry resides in San Diego, California. A graduate from Keene State
College in New Hampshire with a Bachelor of Science, and a graduate from Florida International University with his Master of Science,

Significant
Employees 

We
do not employ any non-officers who are expected to make a significant contribution to our business. 

41 

Committees
of the Board of Directors 

We
do not presently have a separately constituted audit committee, compensation committee, nominating committee, executive committee or
any other committee of our Board of Directors. As such, our entire Board of Directors acts as our audit committee. 

Audit
Committee Financial Expert 

Our
Board of Directors does not currently have any member who qualifies as an audit committee financial expert. We believe that the cost
of retaining such a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. Further, because we are a development stage business, we believe the
services of an audit committee financial expert are not necessary at this time. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
do not currently have a Code of Ethics applicable to our principal executive, financial and accounting officers. 

Potential
Conflict of Interest 

Since
we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been performed by
such committees are performed by our Board of Directors. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our sole director has
the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation, including his own, and audit issues that may affect management
decisions. We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our officers or sole director. 

Board
of Director s Role in Risk Oversight 

The
Board of Directors assesses on an ongoing basis the risks faced by the Company. These risks include financial, technological, competitive,
and operational risks. The Board of Directors dedicates time at each of its meetings to review and consider the relevant risks faced
at that time. In addition, since the Company does not have an Audit Committee, the Board of Directors is also responsible for the assessment
and oversight of the Company s financial risk exposures. 

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

The
table set forth below summarizes the annual and long-term compensation for services in all capacities to us payable to our officers and
directors for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Our Board of Directors may adopt an incentive stock option

13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Related
Party Transactions 

BrewBilt
Brewing Company 

BrewBilt
Brewing Company works closely with BrewBilt Manufacturing Inc., which is also located in Grass Valley, California and led by CEO Jef
Lewis. BrewBilt Manufacturing is supplying all necessary equipment to BrewBilt Brewing for its craft beer production. 

During
the years ending December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Brewbilt Brewing Company paid deposits of 485,209 and 450,000, respectively,
to BrewBilt Manufacturing for fabrication of a brewery system. As of December 31, 2022, the majority of the brewing equipment was completed
and delivered to BrewBilt Brewing. The equipment that was delivered and put into use has a sales price of 1,086,246, which was recognized
as related party revenue on the statement of operations. The Company anticipates the remaining equipment will be complete and delivered
within three months. 

Advances 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, 7,067 and 7,171, respectively, was advanced to the company by Jef Lewis. 

Other
than the foregoing, none of the following persons has any direct or indirect material interest in any transaction to which we were
or are a party since the beginning of our last fiscal year, or in any proposed transaction to which we propose to be a party: 

(A) 
 any
 of our director(s) or executive officer(s); 

(B) 
 any
 nominee for election as one of our directors; 

(C) 
 any
 person who is known by us to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, shares carrying more than 5 of the voting rights attached
 to our Common Stock; or 

(D) 
 any
 member of the immediate family (including spouse, parents, children, siblings and in-laws) of any of the foregoing persons named
 in paragraph (A), (B) or (C) above. 

Director
Independence 

For
purposes of determining director independence, we have applied the definitions set out in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2). The OTCBB on which
shares of Common Stock are quoted does not have any director independence requirements. The NASDAQ definition of Independent Officer 
means a person other than an Executive Officer or employee of the Company or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the
opinion of the Company s Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director. According to the NASDAQ definition, we have no independent directors. 

Review,
Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information
under this item.
