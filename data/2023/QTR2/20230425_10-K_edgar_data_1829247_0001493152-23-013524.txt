1. BUSINESS 

Our
Corporate History and Background 

BullFrog
AI Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 18, 2020. Our principal business address is 325 Ellington
Blvd, Unit 317, Gaithersburg, MD 20878. All of our operations are currently conducted through BullFrog AI Holdings, Inc. BullFrog
AI, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary acquired through a share exchange, has the sole purpose of housing and protecting all of the
organization s intellectual property. BullFrog AI Management, LLC is a wholly owned
subsidiary that handles all HR and payroll activities. 

Acquisition
of BullFrog AI 

In
March 2020, BullFrog AI, Inc. received an investment from TEDCO - the Technology Development Corporation of Maryland, a State of
Maryland Investment Fund pursuant to the issuance of a 200,000 convertible note with an 18-month term, 6 annual interest
rate, and a 20 discount. In June 2020, BullFrog AI Holdings, Inc. acquired BullFrog AI, Inc. pursuant to an exchange agreement
under which each share of Bull Frog AI, Inc. common stock was exchanged for a share of common stock of BullFrog AI Holdings, Inc..
Immediately prior to the share exchange, each outstanding common share of BullFrog AI, Inc. was split into 25 shares of common
stock. Share amounts in our financial statements for 2021 and 2020 have been adjusted to reflect this forward share split and shares
exchange. Pursuant to the agreement, 24,223,975 shares of the Company s common stock were issued to the shareholders of
BullFrog AI, Inc. in exchange for 100 of the outstanding stock of BullFrog AI, Inc. Upon completion of the exchange, BullFrog AI,
Inc. became the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary and the shareholders of BullFrog AI, Inc. held 100 of the common stock of
the Company. As a result, BullFrog AI Holdings, Inc. assumed a total of 330,442 in net liabilities of BullFrog AI, Inc. Both of the
entities were controlled before and after the transactions by the same controlling shareholder. This transaction is being
accounted for as a common control transaction and all entities are being presented as if the transactions took place at the
beginning of the earliest period presented. 

BullFrog
AI Corporate History 

BullFrog
AI, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on August 25, 2017. Vininder Singh is the founder, CEO and chairman of BullFrog AI. 

Our
Strategy 

We
plan to achieve our business objectives by enabling the successful development of drugs and biologics using a precision medicine approach
via our proprietary artificial intelligence platform bfLEAP. We will execute our plan by doing all or any of the following: partnering
with biopharmaceutical companies in a fee for service model to assist and enable them with their drug development programs, acquiring
rights to and rescuing drugs that have failed FDA review following pivotal Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials (we refer to this rescue
process as drug rescue ), acquiring rights to drugs that are in early stage clinical trials and have not failed FDA review, and
discovering new drugs and biologics. 

The
process for enhancing and developing late-stage failed drugs is to: 

acquire
 the rights to the failed drug from a biopharmaceutical industry company or university, 

use
 the proprietary bfLEAP AI/ML platform to determine a multi-factorial profile for a patient that would best respond to the
 drug, 

Rapidly
 conduct a clinical trial likely with a partner to validate the drug s use for the defined high-responder population;
 and 

Divest/sell
 the rescued drug asset with new information back to the pharma industry, following positive results of the clinical trial. 

We
also plan to deploy this strategy for all discovery and early stage clinical candidates. The common objective is to monetize our assets
as quickly as possible with no current plan to commercialize any asset. As part of our strategy, we will continue evolving our intellectual
property, analytical platform and technologies, build a large portfolio of drug candidates, and implement a model that reduces risk and
increases the frequency of cash flow from rescued drugs. This strategy will include strategic partnerships, collaborations, and relationships
along the entire business value chain. 

2 

We
did not produce any revenues through 2021; we generated our first revenues in late 2022 from our services related to the relationship
with a pharmaceutic company. 

To
date, we have not conducted clinical trials on any pharmaceutical drugs and our platform has not been used to identify a drug candidate
that has received regulatory approval for commercialization. However, we currently have a strategic relationship with a leading rare
disease non-profit organization for artificial intelligence/machine learning AI/ML analysis of late stage clinical data. We have acquired the rights to a series of preclinical
and early clinical drug assets from universities and entered into a strategic collaboration with a world renowned research institution
to create a HSV1 viral therapeutic platform to engineer immunotherapies for colorectal cancer. We have signed exclusive worldwide license
agreements with Johns Hopkins University for a cancer drug that targets glioblastoma (brain cancer), pancreatic cancer, and other cancers.
We have also signed an exclusive worldwide license with George Washington University for another cancer drug that targets hepatoceullar
carcinoma (liver cancer), and other liver diseases. 

Our
platform was originally developed by The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory JHU-APL ). JHU-APL uses the same technology for applications related to national defense. Over
several years, the software and algorithms have been used to identify relationships, patterns, and anomalies, and make predictions that
otherwise may not be found. These discoveries and insights provide an advantage when predicting a target of interest, regardless of industry
or sector. We have applied the technology to various clinical data sets and have identified novel relationships that may provide new
intellectual property, new drug targets, and other valuable information that may help with patient stratification for a clinical trial
thereby improving the odds for success. The platform has not yet aided in the development of a drug that has reached commercialization.
However, we have licensed one drug candidate that has completed a Phase 1 trial and a second candidate that is in the preclinical stages.
Our aim is to use our technology on current and future available data to help us better determine the optimal path for development. 

Contract
Services 

Our
fee for service partnership offering is designed for biopharmaceutical companies, as well as other organizations, of all sizes that have
challenges analyzing data throughout the drug development process. We provide the customer with an analysis of large complex data sets
using our proprietary artificial intelligence / machine learning platform called bfLEAP . This platform is designed to predict
targets of interest, patterns, relationships, and anomalies. Our service model involves a cash fee plus the potential for rights to new
intellectual property generated from the analysis, which can be performed at the discovery, preclinical, or clinical stages of drug development.
On September 28, 2022, BullFrog AI entered into a 185,000 service contract with Sapu Biosciences, LLC, a subsidiary of Oncotellic Therapeutics
(OTCQB: OTLC). The scope of the contract is focused on uncovering novel insights related to oncology clinical data for one of their candidate
programs. 

Collaborative
Arrangements 

We
will also seek to enter into collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies who have drugs that have failed late Phase 2
or Phase 3 trials. Our revenue from such collaborations will be based on achieving certain milestones as determined by each specific
arrangement. 

Acquisition
of Rights to Certain Drugs 

In
certain circumstances, we may also acquire rights to drugs that are in early stage clinical trials, use our technology to produce a successful
later stage precision medicine trial, and divest the asset. The same process may apply to the discovery of new drugs.

 Has begun the process of clinical testing but has not received regulatory approval for commercialization. 

On
January 14, 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license from George Washington University (GWU)
for rights to use siRNA targeting Beta2-spectrin in the treatment of human diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The license
covers methods claimed in three U.S. and worldwide patent applications, and also includes use of this approach for treatment of obesity,
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. This program is currently in the preclinical stage of development.
The Company has not yet initiated development activities or IND-enabling studies on this asset; however, the plan is to conduct this
work over the next 24 months. All R D to date on this candidate has been conducted by the licensor of the technology, George Washington
University. 

Non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition in which excess lipids, or fat, build up in the liver. This condition, which is more common
in people who have obesity and related metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes, affects as many as 24 of adults in the US and is
associated with risk of progression to more serious conditions, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with associated liver
inflammation and fibrosis, and HCC. Evidence in animal models of obesity suggest that a protein called 2-spectrin
may play a key role in lipid accumulation, tissue fibrosis, and liver damage, and targeting expression or activity of this protein may
be a useful approach in treating NASH and liver cancer (Rao et al., 2021). 

In
February 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for
the use of an improved formulation of Mebendazole for the treatment of any human cancer or neoplastic disease. This formulation shows
potent activity in animal models of different types of cancer and has been evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial in patients with high-grade
glioma (NCT01729260). The trial, an open-label dose-escalation study, assessed the safety of the improved formulation with adjuvant temozolomide
in 24 patients with newly diagnosed gliomas. Investigators observed no dose-limiting toxicity in patients receiving all but the highest
tested dose (200mg/kg/day). Four of the 15 patients receiving the maximum tested dose of 200mg/kg/day experienced dose-limiting toxicity,
all of which were reversed by decreasing or eliminating the dose given. There were no serious adverse events attributed to mebendazole
at any dose during the trial. The Company is currently formulating a strategy to find a partner to conduct additional clinical trials
with this asset to enable evaluation of safety in humans. 

We
are able to leverage our drug rescue business by leveraging a powerful and proven AI/ML platform (trade name: bfLEAP initially
derived from technology developed at JHU-APL. The bfLEAP analytics platform
is a potentially disruptive tool for analysis of pre-clinical and/or clinical data sets, such as the robust pre-clinical and clinical
trial data sets being generated in translational R D and clinical trial settings. The input data for bfLEAP can include raw
data (preclinical and/or clinical readouts), categorical data, sociodemographic data of patients, and various other inputs. Thus, the
bfLEAP platform is capable of capturing the human experience of patients in an unbiased manner, and contextualizing
it against other disparate data sources from patients (e.g. molecular data, physiological data, etc.) for less biased and more meaningful
conclusions (i.e. more ethical AI/ML). It is also uniquely scalable the bfLEAP platform is able to perform analysis on
large, high-volume data sets (i.e. big data and also able to analyze highly disparate short and wide data
as well. In terms of visualization, bfLEAP is able to integrate with most commonly used visualization tools for graph analytics. 

We
believe the combination of a) scalable analytics (i.e., large data or short/wide data), b) state-of-the-art algorithms, c)
unsupervised machine learning, and d) streamlined data ingestion/visualization makes bfLEAP one of the most flexible and
powerful new platforms available on the market. 

4 

Our
Platform Technology 

We
will continue to evolve and improve bfLEAP , either in-house or with development partners like JHU-APL. The bfLEAP 
platform is based on an exclusive, worldwide license granted by JHU. 

We
plan to leverage our proprietary AI/ML platform developed over several years at one of the top innovation institutions in the world which
has already been successfully applied in multiple sectors. In terms of underlying intellectual property, we have secured a worldwide
exclusive license from JHU-APL for the technology this license covers 3 issued patents, as well as 1 new provisional patent application,
non-patent rights to proprietary libraries of algorithms and other trade secrets, and also includes modifications and improvements. In
addition, we have a unique business model designed to reduce risk and increase the frequency of cash flow. 

The
Company has recently licensed new technology from JHU-APL to evolve the bfLEAP platform to bfLEAP
2.0. This new and improved platform will enable more robust analysis of data with faster and higher precision prediction of the most
important variables for identifying patient response to a drug. 

Going
forward, the Company will continue to evolve the platform and either develop or acquire new capabilities and technologies. These development
efforts may be in house or in collaboration with an existing or new technology partners. The Company plans on hiring talent in data science
and software development to bolster its in house capabilities. 

Summary
for CATIE Schizophrenia Case Study 

The Company worked with the Lieber Institute for Brain Development to analyze data from the landmark CATIE trials. The CATIE trials were the largest
trials ever conducted for anti-psychotic medications. BullFrog analyzed CATIE data from ~200 schizophrenia patients, with a library of
almost 1 million genetic data points for each patient, more than 200 non-genetic attributes per patient, and 4 different medications
used in the trial. For each of the four medications used, bfLEAP analysis revealed new, previously unknown relationships between
individual genetic variants and negative patient symptoms. The genetic loci identified represent potential druggable targets, as well
as potential stratifying criteria for future clinical trials in schizophrenia. 

We
performed another analysis on the data using our new advanced clustering algorithms bfLEAP 2.0 but focused on one particular drug named
Olanzapine. Our bfLEAP 2.0 analytical results identified previously unknown, multi-dimensional associations among newly identified
genetic variants, drug clearance, clinical trial sites, and clinical outcome variables in schizophrenia patients. 

5 

FIGURE
1 bfLEAP Analytical Map 

Each
green node represents a different sampling of the data, and arrows point to attributes (blue nodes) which were found to be key indicators
according to that sampling. Attribute importance is determined by how many samplings identify that attribute as an indicator (i.e., number
of incoming arrows to each blue node). 

6 

Identification
of clustered multi-variate associations (e.g., novel genetic variants, drug clearance, substance abuse) could help us 1) identify novel
drug targets, 2) predict which patients are most likely to respond, and 3) identify modifiable factors that could contribute to better
outcomes. 

Summary
for Cardiovascular Case Study 

The Company worked with an international collaborator in cardiovascular devices to analyze data from an ongoing clinical trial for a new device.
BullFrog analyzed data from ~55 patients, with a library of almost 15,000 unique attributes of data for each patient. The data also included
adverse events, and key demographic information. For this collaborator, bfLEAP analysis was able to provide ground truth for the
company - confirming multiple correlations and non-correlations within the data. In terms of actionable output, the analytical results
confirmed at least two demographic co-variates for the ongoing trial, and also provided a starting point for deeper physiological and
molecular studies. 

Our
Supply Chain and Customer Base 

We
have launched our businesses using funds from our initial public offering and through our partnerships and relationships. We have a strategic
relationship with FSHD Society, a leading non-governmental organization, for AI/ML analysis of clinical trial data for patients with
a rare neuromuscular disorder. We also have several other developing strategic relationships in the project design phase. The Company
has executed a joint development deal for a biologics discovery phase opportunity that is directed toward targeted cancer therapeutics.
The Company has also obtained exclusive worldwide rights to a Phase 2 ready glioblastoma drug and a discovery phase hepatocellular carcinoma
drug from universities. Since we intend to conduct late-stage clinical trials with partners on rescued therapeutic assets, there will
be a requirement of drug product or other significant services to plan and execute our clinical development programs. The success of
our partnered clinical development programs will require adequate availability of raw materials and/or drug product for our R D and
clinical trials, and, in some cases, may also require establishment of third-party arrangements to obtain finished drug product that
is manufactured appropriately under industry-standard guidelines, and packaged for clinical use or sale. Since we are a digital biopharmaceutical
company, our clinical development programs will also require, in some cases, establishment of third-party relationships for execution
and completion of clinical trials. 

Our
Market Opportunity 

One
aim of our business is to rescue drugs that have failed in phase 3 clinical trials by using our technology to analyze all
available data with the goal of designing a precision medicine clinical trial that will have a better chance of being successful. The
graphic below illustrates the estimated market opportunity for these failed drugs. The top arrow shows the number of failed phase 3 trials

Identification
of candidates with potential for rescue may be challenging and require significant resources, and once these assets are identified the
Company may find it challenging to license them under favorable terms in order to create value for shareholders. Subsequent development
of these assets for clinical testing may require significant effort and resources. Ultimately, these assets must undergo rigorous clinical
testing and approval by FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in other countries in order to be marketed. A key part of our strategy
is to partner our R D programs. In addition, we do not intend on commercializing drugs and instead will seek to divest each drug
asset to a company that will commercialize the drug. The Company may receive future royalties in come transactions.

On
February 7, 2018, we entered into a License Agreement (the License Agreement with JHU-APL, a Maryland limited liability company JHU ). Pursuant to the License Agreement, JHU-APL granted the
Company exclusive rights to intellectual property of JHU related to analytical services for applications in biological and chemical derived
pharmaceutical therapeutics. The License Agreement provides for the grant of an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license by JHU
to the Company, with the right to sublicense, in order to conduct research using the patent rights and know-how and to develop and commercialize
products in the field using the patent rights and know-how. In consideration of the rights granted to the Company under the License Agreement,
the Company granted JHU received a warrant equal to five (5 percent of the then fully diluted equity base of the Company, which was
diluted following our public offering. Under the terms of the License Agreement, the Company is required to use commercially reasonable
efforts to meet certain development milestones and minimum net sales milestones, and JHU will be entitled to eight (8 percent of net
sales for the services provided by the Company in which the JHU license was utilized, as well as fifty (50 percent of all sublicense
revenues received by the Company. In addition, the Company is required to pay JHU an annual maintenance fee of 1,500. The Company is
also obligated to make minimum annual payments. These minimum annual payments to JHU were amended on September 3, 2020 to 20,000 in
calendar year 2022, 80,000 in calendar year 2023, 300,000 in calendar year 2024, and 300,000 in calendar year 2025 and each year thereafter,
which may be offset against royalties paid by the Company for the year in which the minimum annual royalty becomes due. 

The
License Agreement will, unless sooner terminated, continue in each country until the date of expiration of the last to expire patent
included within the patent rights in that country, or if no patents issue, then for 10 years. The License Agreement may be terminated
by the Company upon 60 days written notice in its discretion. The License Agreement may also be terminated by JHU if the Company
is in material breach of the License Agreement and fails to cure such breach within a 60-day cure period commencing upon notice. A material
breach by the Company may include a delinquency with respect to payment or the failure by the Company to timely achieve a specified milestone. 

We
also have exclusive, worldwide licenses to other intellectual property from JHU that are being held as trade secrets related to our algorithm
libraries, pattern recognition, shallow-and-wide data sets, and time series correlation. We anticipate that new intellectual property
(patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, etc.) will be generated through the course of executing our strategic development projects,
and also through the course of improving, modifying, and scaling our bfLEAP platform. In October 2021, we amended the agreement
with JHU-APL to include additional advanced AI technology. Currently, the latest patent grant date was in March 2021. 

On
July 8, 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from JHU-APL for the additional technology
(the 2022 License Agreement ). This license provides additional intellectual property rights including patents,
copyrights and knowhow to be utilized under the Company s bfLEAP analytical AI/ML platform. Under the terms of the 2022
License Agreement, JHU will be entitled to eight (8 percent of net sales for the services provided by the Company to other parties
and 3 for internally development drug projects in which the JHU license is utilized. The 2022 License Agreement also contains
tiered sub licensing fees that start at 50 and reduce to 25 based on revenues. In addition, the Company is required to pay JHU an
annual maintenance fee of 1,500. Minimum annual payments are set to be 30,000 for 2022, 80,000 for 2023, and 300,000 for 2024
and beyond, all of which are creditable by royalties. The financial terms of the new license agreement replace the original terms
and are not duplicative. 

George
Washington University - Beta2-spectrin siRNA License 

On
January 14, 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from GWU for rights to use siRNA targeting Beta2-spectrin in the treatment of human diseases, including HCC. The license
covers methods claimed in three US and worldwide patent applications, and also includes use of this approach for treatment of obesity,
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. This program is currently in the preclinical stage of development.
The Company has not yet initiated development activities or IND-enabling studies on this asset; however, the plan is to conduct this
work over the next 24 months. All R D to date on this candidate has been conducted by the licensor of the technology, George Washington
University. The term of the agreement began on January 14, 2022 and ends on the expiration date of the last patent to expire or 10 years
after the first sale of a licensed product if no patents have issued. The license can be terminated by the licensee upon 60 days 
written notice, or by the licensor if the Company is more than 30 days late in paying amounts owed to the licensor and does not make
payment upon demand, or in the event of any material breach of the license that is not cured within 45 days. 

Non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition in which excess lipids, or fat, build up in the liver. This condition, which is more common
in people who have obesity and related metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes, affects as many as 24 of adults in the US and is
associated with risk of progression to more serious conditions, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with associated liver
inflammation and fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Evidence in animal models of obesity suggest that a protein called 2-spectrin
may play a key role in lipid accumulation, tissue fibrosis, and liver damage, and targeting expression or activity of this protein may
be a useful approach in treating NASH and liver cancer (Rao et al., 2021). 

11 

In
consideration of the rights granted to the Company under the license agreement, GWU received a 20,000 License Initiation Fee. Under
the terms of the License Agreement, GWU will be entitled to a three percent (3 royalty on net sales subject to quarterly minimums once
the first sale has occurred subsequent to regulatory approval, as well sublicense or assignment fees in the event the Company sublicenses
or assigns their rights to use the technology. The Company will also reimburse GWU for previously incurred and ongoing patent costs.
The Sublicense and Assignment fee amounts decline as the Company advances the clinical development of the licensed technology. The license
agreement also contains milestone payments for clinical development through the approval of an NDA and commercialization. 

Aggregate
payments made to GWU to date include the 20,000 License Initiation Fee and an additional 6,550 to reimburse the licensor for past patent
costs. Aggregate future milestone costs could reach 860,000 if the drug successfully completes clinical trials and is the subject of
a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. FDA. Future milestones on sales revenue are limited to 1M on the first 20M in net sales. 

Johns
Hopkins University Mebendazole License 

On
February 22, 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license from JHU for
the use of an improved formulation of Mebendazole for the treatment of any human cancer or neoplastic disease. This formulation shows
potent activity in animal models of different types of cancer, and has been evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial in patients with high-grade
glioma (NCT01729260). The trial, an open-label dose-escalation study, assessed the safety of the improved formulation with adjuvant temozolomide
in 24 patients with newly diagnosed gliomas. Investigators observed no dose-limiting toxicity in patients receiving all but the highest
tested dose (200mg/kg/day). Four of the 15 patients receiving the maximum tested dose of 200mg/kg/day experienced dose-limiting toxicity,
all of which were reversed by decreasing or eliminating the dose given. There were no serious adverse events attributed to mebendazole
at any dose during the trial. The Company is currently formulating a strategy to conduct additional clinical trials with this asset to
enable evaluation of safety in humans. 

The
license covers six (6) issued patents and one (1) pending application, with the term of the agreement beginning on February 22, 2022
and ending on the date of expiration of the last to expire patent. The license can be terminated by the licensee upon 90 days 
written notice, or by the licensor in the event of any material breach of the license that is not cured within 30 days. In consideration
of the rights granted to the Company under the license agreement, JHU will receive a staggered Upfront License Fee of 250,000, with
the first 50,000 payment due within 30 days of the effective date. The Company will also reimburse JHU for previously incurred and ongoing
patent costs. Under the terms of the license agreement, JHU will be entitled to three- and one-half percent (3.5 royalty on net sales
by the Company. In addition, the Company is required to pay JHU minimum annual royalty payments of 5,000 for 2023, 10,000 for 2024,
 20,000 for 2025, 30,000 for 2026 and 50,000 for 2027 and each year after until the first commercial sale after which the annual minimum
royalty shall be 250,000. The license agreement also contains milestone payments for clinical development steps through the approval
of an NDA and commercialization. Aggregate payments made to date include the initial 50,000 upfront fee and an additional 79,232.53
to reimburse the licensor for past patent costs. Aggregate future milestone costs could reach 1,500,000 if the drug successfully completes
Phase II and III clinical trials and is approved for sale and marketing by the US FDA. Future milestones on sales revenue are 1M on
the first 20M in sales revenue, 2M in the first year cumulative sales revenue exceeds 100M, 10M in the first year cumulative sales
revenue exceeds 500M, and 20M in the first year cumulative sales revenue exceeds 1B. 

JHU
 Mebendazole Prodrug License 

On
October 13, 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license from JHU and
the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry (IOCB) of the Czech Academy of Sciences for rights to commercialize N-substituted
prodrugs of mebendazole that demonstrate improved solubility and bioavailability. The license covers prodrug compositions and use for
treating disease as claimed in multiple US and worldwide patent applications. The term of the agreement began on October 13, 2022and
continues until the date of expiration of the last to expire patent, or for 20 years from the effective date of the agreement if no patents
issue. The license can be terminated by the Company upon 90 days written notice, or by the licensor in the event of any material
breach of the license that is not cured by the Company within 30 days. 

12 

In
consideration for the rights granted to the Company under the License Agreement JHU and IOCB will receive a staggered upfront license
fee of 100,000. The Company will also reimburse JHU and IOCB for previously incurred patent costs totaling 33,265 and will be responsible
for reimbursing licensors for future patent costs. Under the terms of the License Agreement, the licensors will be entitled to a four
percent (4 royalty on net sales subject to annual minimums upon first commercial sale of a licensed product, as well sublicense or
assignment fees in the event the Company sublicenses or assigns their rights to use the technology. The Sublicense fee amount declines
as the Company advances the clinical development of the licensed technology. The Company is required to pay minimum annual royalties
(MAR) beginning in year 4 of the agreement. The MAR for year 4 will be 5,000, increasing to 10,000 in year 5, 20,000 in year 6, 30,000
in year 7, and 50,000 in year 8 and subsequent years. The Company will be responsible for milestone payments for patent issuance of
up to 50,000 and clinical development milestones up to and including approval of an NDA totaling up to 2.3M. The Company will be required
to pay a commercial milestone of 1M once sales reach 20M in the US, 2M when sales in the US reach 100M, 10M when US sales reach
 500M, and 20M when US sales exceed 1B. 

Competition 

The
pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis
on proprietary products. The immuno-oncology, neuroscience, and rare disease segments of the industry in particular are highly competitive.
While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide competitive advantages, we face potential
competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, academic
institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. 

Many
of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical
studies, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved medicines than we do. Mergers and acquisitions
in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller
number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel
and in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary
to or necessary for our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through
collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 

The
key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety,
convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, if any, the level of generic
competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 

Our
commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, are more
effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any medicines we may develop. Our competitors
also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their medicines more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result
in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete
may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic medicines. There are many
generic medicines currently on the market for certain of the indications that we are pursuing, and additional generics are expected to
become available over the coming years. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant
premium over competitive generic medicines. 

Any
product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become
available in the future. If the product candidates of our priority programs are approved for the indications for which we are currently
planning clinical trials, they will compete with the drugs discussed below and will likely compete with other drugs currently in development. 

bfLEAP

The
analytics industry and application of AI in healthcare is growing rapidly. Competition exists along the entire continuum of the drug
development process from discovery to commercialization and beyond. We believe the weakness of the industry is the quality of the data
and we believe bfLEAP provides several competitive advantages, that will position the Company for success, First, bfLEAP is highly scalable
and can process data from small to extremely large complex data sets without the need for additional code being developed. Second, it
is adept at processing and analyzing incomplete data and making predictions that we do not believe other technologies are capable of
doing. Finally, bfLEAP has the ability to extract the most important features for analysis out of extremely large complex data sets using
unsupervised machine learning algorithms, thereby greatly simplifying complex problems. Since data quality is a problem that exists in
the healthcare industry, we see these as major differentiators. The ability to make predictions, find relationships and patterns and
anomalies in extremely large complex data sets has been demonstrated by the Applied Physics Lab in other applications and sectors. Finally,
the algorithms used by bfLEAP are proprietary and protected, having been developed at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab. We
believe most of the competitors rely on open source algorithms and we also believe that we have already demonstrated our superiority
via the August 2021 publication in DeepAI.org. 

13 

Government
Regulation 

The
FDA does not currently require approval of AI technologies used to aid in therapeutics, but that could change in the future. The FDA
will regulate any clinical trials conducted by the Company. 

Our
clinical development programs will, in some cases, require regulatory review of preclinical and/or clinical data by the FDA or other
governing agencies, and subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations. The results
of the clinical trials that we conduct will be evaluated by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. The comments and approvals that are
obtained are expected to lead to milestone payments under the collaborative agreement. Accordingly, our ability to navigate the regulatory
process is extremely important to the success of the Company. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in this process due to
primarily focusing on drug candidates that already have some level of success in clinical trials. Previous success of a particular candidate
in trials combined with our precision medicine approach to clinical trial design using our bfLEAP platform, will de-risk the development
process and improve the chances for success. 

Government
Regulation and Product Approval 

Government
authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions extensively regulate,
among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling,
advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products.
The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent
compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and
financial resources. 

FDA
Approval Process 

In
the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD C
Act) and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture,
storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and
import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety
of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications (NDAs), warning or untitled letters,
product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and
criminal prosecution. 

Pharmaceutical
product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory
and animal tests, the submission to FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND) which must become effective before clinical
testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each
indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the
actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 

Preclinical
tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics
and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements,
including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to FDA as part of an IND along with other information,
including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical
tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period
after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If FDA has neither commented on
nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration
of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials
must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international
standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors;
as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness
criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to FDA
as part of the IND. 

14 

Clinical
trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase
1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics,
pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually
involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance
and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a drug demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an
acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy
and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the
overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, FDA requires
two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory
evidence may be sufficient in rare instances, such as where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency
and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a
disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. 

After
completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing
of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation
of data relating to the product s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA
is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an
approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee for each prescription product. These fees are typically increased annually. Sponsors
of applications for drugs granted Orphan Drug Designation are exempt from these user fees. 

FDA
may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside
advisory committee typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts for review, evaluation and a recommendation
as to whether the application should be approved. FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows
such recommendations. 

Before
approving an NDA, FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, FDA will inspect
the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good
manufacturing practices (cGMPs) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and
effective in the indication studied. 

Fast
Track Designation 

FDA
is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening
disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for
the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for
a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. FDA must determine
if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor s request. 

If
a submission is granted Fast Track Designation, the sponsor may engage in more frequent interactions with FDA, and FDA may review sections
of the NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule
for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, FDA s time period goal for
reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. While we may seek Fast Track Designation, there
is no guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining any such designation. Even if we do obtain such designation, we may not experience
a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. A Fast Track Designation does not ensure that
the product candidate will receive marketing approval or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. Additionally,
Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by FDA if FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical
trial process. 

Post-Approval
Requirements 

Once
an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, FDA closely regulates the post-approval
marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored
scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved
indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 

Adverse
event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. FDA also may require post-marketing
testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or FDA may place conditions on
an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and
labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required
to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced
inspections by FDA, during which the Agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers
must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory
authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters
problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 

15 

Generic
Competition 

In
seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant s
product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA s Approved
Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn,
be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). An ANDA provides for
marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been
shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence
testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness
of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the listed drug and
can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 

The
ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA s Orange Book.
Specifically, the applicant must certify that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired;
(iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv)
the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product (a Paragraph IV certification). The ANDA applicant may also
elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding
the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents
or certifies that the listed patents will not be infringed by the new product, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the
listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification, the NDA
and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45
days of the receipt of a such certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration
of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 

Exclusivity 

Upon
NDA approval of a new chemical entity (NCE) that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any
ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph
IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus,
no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication
to the package insert, can be the subject of a three-year period of exclusivity if the application contains reports of new clinical investigations
(other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the sponsor that were essential to approval of the application. FDA cannot
approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change during the period of exclusivity. 

Patent
Term Extension 

After
NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is
calculated as half of the drug s testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase
(the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years). The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant
did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years, and only one patent can
be extended. For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An
interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension
granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office must
determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions
are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted. 

Other
Healthcare Laws 

In
the United States, biotechnology company activities are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition
to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General and the Office for Civil Rights), the U.S. Department of Justice
(DOJ) and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, research, sales, marketing and
scientific/educational grant programs have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal
false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and similar
state laws, each as amended, as applicable. 

16 

Also,
many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other
state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 

Data
privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which business is conducted may also be applicable.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations,
imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA requires
covered entities to limit the use and disclosure of protected health information to specifically authorized situations and requires covered
entities to implement security measures to protect health information that they maintain in electronic form. Among other things, HITECH
made HIPAA s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities
that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also
created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business
associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce
the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws
govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant
ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Insurance
Coverage and Reimbursement 

Significant
uncertainty exists as to the insurance coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval.
In the United States, sales of any product candidates for which regulatory approval for commercial sale is obtained will depend in part
on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities
and health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. The process for determining whether
a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will
pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might
not include all of FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A payor s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does
not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly
from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us
to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and
adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.

OVERVIEW 

Bullfrog
AI Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 6, 2020. Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc. is the parent company of Bullfrog
AI, Inc. and Bullfrog AI Management, LLC, which were incorporated in Delaware and Maryland, in 2017 and 2021, respectively. Operations
are currently conducted through BullFrog AI Holdings, Inc., which began operations on February 6, 2020. We are a company focused specifically
on advanced Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML) analysis of complex data in the advancement of medicine. Our AI/ML platform
(trade name: bfLEAP was created from technology originally developed at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory
(JHU-APL). 

In
February 2018, BullFrog AI Holdings secured the original exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license from JHU-APL for the
technology. The license covers three (3) issued patents, one (1) new provisional patent application, non-patent rights to
proprietary libraries of algorithms and other trade secrets including modifications and improvements. We entered into a license
agreement in July 2022 that provides the Company with new intellectual property and also encompasses
most of the intellectual property from the February 2018 license. Our objective is to utilize our for a precision medicine approach
toward drug development with biopharmaceutical collaborators, as well as our own internal clinical development programs. We believe
the bfLEAP platform is ideally suited for evaluating pre-clinical and clinical trial data generated in translational research
and clinical trial settings that lead to faster, less expensive drug approvals. 

Our
aim is to improve the odds of success in each stage of developing medicine, ranging from early pre-clinical through late-stage clinical
development. Our ultimate objective is to utilize bfLEAP to enable the success of ongoing clinical trials or rescue late-stage
failed drugs (i.e., Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial failures) for development and divestiture; although, we will also consider collaborations
for earlier stage drugs. We hope to accomplish this through strategic acquisitions of current clinical stage and failed drugs for in-house
development, or through strategic partnerships with biopharmaceutical industry companies. 

On
July 8, 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license from JHU-APL for the additional technology.
The new license provides additional intellectual property rights including patents, copyrights and knowhow to be utilized under the Company s
bfLEAP analytical AI/ML platform. In consideration of the new license, the Company issued to JHU-APL 39,879 shares of common stock.
In September 2020 and October of 2021, the Company executed amendments to the original license which represents improvements and new
advanced analytics capabilities. In consideration of the rights granted to the Company under the original License Agreement, the Company
granted JHU 178,571 warrants exercisable to purchase shares of common stock at 2.10 per share. Under the terms of the new License Agreement,
JHU will be entitled to eight (8 percent of net sales for the services provided by the Company to other parties and 3 for internally
development drug projects in which the JHU license was utilized. The new license also contains tiered sub licensing fees that start at
50 and reduce to 25 based on revenues. In addition, the Company is required to pay JHU an annual maintenance fee of 1,500. Minimum
annual payments are set to be 30,000 for 2022, 80,000 for 2023, and 300,000 for 2024 and beyond, all of which are creditable by royalties. 

We
will continue to evolve and improve bfLEAP , either in-house or with development partners like JHU-APL. We plan to leverage our proprietary AI/ML platform developed over several years at one of the top innovation institutions
in the world which has already been successfully applied in multiple sectors. 

19 

We
have begun to ramp our business using funds from our initial public offer offering and through our partnerships and relationships.
We currently have a strategic relationship with a leading rare disease non-profit organization for AI/ML analysis of late-stage
clinical data. We have also acquired the rights to a series of preclinical and early clinical drug assets from universities, as well
as a strategic collaboration with a world-renowned research institution to create a HSV1 viral therapeutic platform to engineer
immunotherapies for a variety of diseases. We have signed exclusive worldwide License Agreements with JHU for a
cancer drug that targets glioblastoma (brain cancer), pancreatic cancer, and others. We have also signed an exclusive worldwide
license from George Washington University for another cancer drug that targets hepatoceullar carcinoma (liver cancer), and other
liver diseases. Additionally, we intend to gain access to later-stage clinical assets through partnerships or the acquisition of
rights to failed therapeutic candidates for drug rescue. In certain circumstances, we intend to conduct late-stage clinical trials
in an effort to rescue therapeutic assets that previously failed. In these cases there will be a requirement for a drug supply and
regulatory services to conduct clinical trials. The success of our clinical development programs will require finding partners to
support the clinical development, adequate availability of raw materials and/or drug product for our R D and clinical trials,
and, in some cases, may also require establishment of third-party arrangements to obtain finished drug product that is manufactured
appropriately under (GMP) industry-standard guidelines, and packaged for clinical use or sale. Since we are a company focused on
using our AI technology to advance medicines, any clinical development programs will also require, in all cases, partners and the
establishment of third-party relationships for execution and completion of clinical trials. Over the next 24 months, the Company
expects to spend approximately 2.1 million on service offering products, preclinical IND enabling activities and on R D to
enable future clinical trials evaluating our drug assets for new disease indications. 

Our
Strategy 

The
Company has a unique strategy designed to reduce risk and increase the frequency of cash flow. The first part of the strategy is to generate
revenues through strategic relationships with biopharma companies. These relationships will be structured as a combination of fees and
intellectual property based on the specific scope of the engagement. The objective of these engagements will be to uncover valuable insights
to reduce the risk and/or increase the speed of the drug development process which can be achieved through manual or automated integration
into the client s work flow or analysis of discrete data sets. 

In
the future, the second part of our strategy involves acquiring the rights to clinical stage drugs, using our bfLEAP technology to design
a precision medicine trial, conduct the trial with a partner, and sell the asset. This approach may also apply to earlier phases in the
drug development process such as discovery and preclinical. In any case, the objective is to create near term value and exit and monetize
as quickly as possible, preferably within approximately 30 months. 

Results
of Operations 

For
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 

In
late 2022, the Company recognized its first service revenues of 10,000 related to an analysis contract with a small pharmaceutical
company. The Company previously had not recorded any revenues. Through the end of 2022, the Company has an accumulated deficit of
approximately 4,399,000. Net loss from operations in 2022 was approximately 2,455,000 versus 555,000 in 2021. The 2022 increase
reflects the full year costs of engaging advisors and consultants and other costs associated with preparing the Company for its
initial public offering including the costs related to auditing the Company s past and current financial statements. Cash used
in operations in 2022 was approximately 911,000 versus approximately 382,000 in 2021 and net cash inflows from financing
activities in 2022 was approximately 967,000 versus approximately 387,000 in 2021. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

In
2021, we received net proceeds of approximately 387,000, primarily from the sale of a SAFE note 150,000) and a convertible promissory
note 99,900) and three unsecured promissory notes 49,000) to a related party. In addition, in July and December 2021, the Company
sold convertible bridge notes to two unrelated parties and received net proceeds of approximately 88,000. In the period ended December
31, 2022 the Company received net proceeds from the sale of Convertible Bridge Notes of approximately 1,016,000 and repaid the unsecured
promissory notes sold in 2021 in the amount of 49,000. 

Through
2021, the Company primarily operated with only one full time employee and a series of consultants. During this period, the primary activities
included: technology evaluation, acquisition and validation, capital acquisition and business development activities which in general,
have readied the Company for contract services while exploring strategic partnering and asset acquisition. The majority of this was paid
to employees and consultants as compensation. In 2021, the Company used approximately 382,000 on operating activities including approximately
 203,000 in salaries and approximately 150,000 on professional services and fees directly related to preparation for the intended IPO.
The Company also made payments totaling 25,000 under two evaluation/option agreements for the two drug development programs licensed
in 2022. In 2022, three consultants engaged by the Company became part time employees and the Company now has four employees. For the
year ended December 31, 2022, the Company used approximately 911,000 on operating activities versus approximately 382,000 for the same
period in 2021. The 2022 cash use included approximately 548,000 in salaries, approximately 634,000 in consulting and professional
fees including legal, accounting and auditing fees as well as consulting fees for operational activities and approximately 609,000 in
technology license fees, patent cost reimbursements and minimum annual royalties which has been recorded as a research development
expense. 

20 

Through
December 31, 2022, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately 4,399,000 and funded its operations through the sale of common
stock and debt. We anticipate that our expenses will increase in the future to support our service offerings, clinical and pre-clinical
research and development activities associated with strategic partnering and collaborations as we well as acquired product candidates
and the increased costs of operating as a public company. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of
additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, among other expenses. Additionally, we anticipate increased
costs associated with being a public company including expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange
listing and Securities and Exchange Commission requirements, insurance, and investor relations costs. 

The
Company s current operations include BullFrog AI, Inc. and BullFrog Management, LLC, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of BullFrog
AI Holdings, Inc., which is a holding company that depends upon the sale of its securities and cash generated through its subsidiaries
to fund consolidated operations. 

Through
December 31, 2022, the Company received net proceeds of approximately 1,016,000 from the sale of convertible promissory notes and warrants. 

On February 16, 2023, the Company completed
its initial public offering of 1,297,318 units (each, a Unit, collectively, the Units at a price of
 6.50 per unit for a total of approximately 8.4 million of gross proceeds to the Company. Each Unit consists of one share of the
Company s common stock, one tradeable warrant (each, a Tradeable Warrant, collectively, the Tradeable
Warrants to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of 7.80 per share, and one non-tradeable warrant (each,
a Non-tradeable Warrant, collectively, the Non-tradeable Warrants together with the Tradeable Warrants,
each, a Warrant, collectively, the Warrants to purchase one share of the Company s common stock
at an exercise price of 8.125. The offering closed on February 16, 2023. 

In
connection with and prior to the consummation of the initial public offering, the Company effected a reverse split of its
outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 1:7 - 1 share of new common stock for 7 shares of then outstanding common stock.
Also in connection with the initial public offering, a SAFE and convertible loan agreement held by a related party converted into
55,787 shares of post reverse split common stock. Additionally, all outstanding convertible bridge notes and accrued interest
through November 30, 2022 were converted into 276,289 shares common stock and 276,289 warrants to purchase common stock (post
reverse stock split) were issued to the Convertible Bridge Note holders at conversion. The convertible bridge note conversions and
the warrant exercise pricing was determined using a 25 million dollar company valuation immediately before the initial public
offering. 

Between
April 5 and April 13, 2023, the holders of warrants exercised 436,533 (post reverse stock split) warrants for common stock at
various exercise prices and the Company received proceeds of approximately 1,495,000. 

In
the absence of revenues in 2023 management believes the company s capital resources are sufficient to fund planned operations for
substantially longer than 12 months from the date of this filing. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

In
Footnote 2 of our Audited Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 found elsewhere in this filing, we included a discussion
of the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. There has been no material change in the
policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements since the completion of the 2022 audit.

generated our first revenues in late 2022 from our services provided to a pharmaceutical customer. We have service contracts with two
organizations and currently have multiple discussions underway and anticipate, although there can be no assurance, entering into additional
service agreements and business relationships in 2023. 

Operating
Expenses 

We
classify our operating expenses into two categories: research and development and general and administrative. Prior to 2022, most of
our activities were related to: technology evaluation, acquisition and validation, capital acquisition and business development activities
in general, which we believe have readied the Company for contract services while exploring strategic partnering and asset acquisition.
These activities and related expenditures have been recorded and reported as General and Administrative in our Financial Statements.
In 2022, we licensed two drug development programs from universities and also entered into a new license with JHU-APL for new IP and other
enhancements used with our bfLEAP platform. In 2022, we expended appropriately 608,000 on license related payments for our bfLEAP 
AI/ML platform and our two drug development programs from universities. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase
in 2023 as we initiate activities directed towards the development of service offering products, collaborations (JCVI) and preclinical
IND enabling studies. 

Research
and Development Costs and Expenses 

Research
and development costs and expenses consist primarily of costs related to the acquisition of licensed technology and fees paid to external
service providers. We anticipate our research and development costs could become significant as we execute on our business plan and begin
conducting preclinical research and development activities directed at securing development partners and filing Investigational New Drug
(IND) applications for our licensed drug development programs describes in this filing, as well as under strategic partnerships and for
other drug development programs we may acquire. Research and development expenses are recorded in operating expenses in the period in
which they are incurred. Estimates will be used in determining the expense liability of certain costs where services have been performed
but not yet invoiced. We will monitor levels of performance under each significant contract for external services through communications
with the service providers to reflect the actual amount expended. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

In
anticipation of the initial public offering, a management team with deep industry experience was been identified and engaged as
employees and consultants to assist the Company in preparing for the initial public offering and subsequently, to operate and
function as a public company. Through 2021, the Company primarily operated with only one full time employee and a series of
consultants. In 2022, three of the consultants became part time employees of the Company. During this period, the primary activities
included: technology evaluation, acquisition and validation, capital acquisition and business development activities which in
general, have readied the Company for contract services while exploring strategic partnering and asset acquisition as noted above.
The Company s financial statements reflect an accumulated deficit of approximately 4,400,000 as a result of these activities
including the licensing costs for bfLEAP . In 2022, the Statement of Operation reflects approximately 2,457,000 in operating
expenses versus 555,000 in the 2021 period. The increase reflects the Company s continued preparation for its IPO including
legal and accounting costs related to the audit of the Company s financial statements including those presented in the
Company s S-1 filed in connection with the Company s IPO in February 2023. The Company also engaged the management team
noted above which resulted in increased consulting and stock-based compensation expenses in 2021 and 2022. The 2022 Consolidated
Statement of Operations reflects Salaries of approximately 548,000, Consulting and other professional fees of approximately
 644,000 and Stock based compensation of 340,000. For the 2021 period, these amounts were approximately 203,000, 140,000 and
 99,000. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support our service offerings,
clinical and pre-clinical research and development activities associated with strategic partnering and collaborations as well as any
newly acquired product candidates and the increased costs of operating as a public company. These increases will likely include
increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, among other
expenses. Additionally, we anticipate increased costs associated with being a public company including expenses related to services
associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and Securities and Exchange Commission requirements, insurance, and
investor relations costs.

Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 

We
are transitioning to and will maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and timely reported as provided
in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, as appropriate, to allow for timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. We will periodically review the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures,
including compliance with various laws and regulations that apply to our operations. We will make modifications to improve the design
and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and may take other corrective action if our reviews identify a need for such
modifications or actions. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we will
apply judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system
of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations
in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)

ITEM
13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Other
than as set forth below and compensation arrangements, including employment, and indemnification arrangements, discussed, there have
been no transactions since January 1, 2021, in which the amount involved in the transaction exceeded or will exceed the lesser of 120,000
or one percent of the average of our total assets as at the year-end for the last two completed fiscal years, and to which any of our
directors, executive officers or beneficial holders of more than 5 of our capital stock, or any immediate family member of, or person
sharing the household with, any of these individuals, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 

On
July 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), with a related party, Tivoli Trust, our second largest
shareholder (the Investor ), with an amount of 150,000, with 0 interest. Under the SAFE agreement, if
there is an Equity Financing before the termination of this SAFE , on the initial closing
of such Equity Financing, this SAFE will automatically convert into the number of shares
of SAFE Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Conversion Price, which
means either: (1) the Safe Price (the price per share equal to the Post-Money Valuation Cap divided by the Company Capitalization) or
(2) the Discount Price (the price per share of the Standard Preferred Stock sold in the Equity Financing multiplied by the Discount Rate),
whichever calculation results in a greater number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock. 

If
there is a Liquidity Event before the termination of this SAFE , this SAFE
 will automatically be entitled (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion of Proceeds,
due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of such Liquidity Event, equal to the greater
of (i) the Purchase Amount (the Cash-Out Amount or (ii) the amount payable on the number of shares of Common Stock equal
to the Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price (the Conversion Amount ). If any of the Company s securityholders
are given a choice as to the form and amount of Proceeds to be received in a Liquidity Event, the Investor will be given the same choice,
provided that the Investor may not choose to receive a form of consideration that the Investor would be ineligible to receive as a result
of the Investor s failure to satisfy any requirement or limitation generally applicable to the Company s securityholders,
or under any applicable laws. 

This
 SAFE will automatically terminate (without relieving the Company of any obligations arising
from a prior breach of or non-compliance with this SAFE immediately following the earliest
to occur of: (i) the issuance of Capital Stock to the Investor pursuant to the automatic conversion of this SAFE under agreement; or
(ii) the payment, or setting aside for payment, of amounts due the Investor pursuant to the agreement. 

As
of December 31, 2021, the 150,000 received from SAFE was recorded at 6 imputed interest. The
maturity date of the loan is defined by the SAFE agreement as discussed above. The SAFE was converted into 32,967 shares of common
stock (post reverse stock split) upon the Company s IPO in February 2023. 

On
August 19, 2021, the company entered into a convertible loan agreement with a related party, with a principal balance of 99,900 at 9 
interest. The noteholder has the right to convert the principal and interest into common shares of the Company. This loan included an
original issuance discount of 5 and included 99,900 Warrants at an exercise price of 1, exercisable for 5 years from the issue date
on the face of the Warrant. The maturity date of the loan was February 19, 2022. In May 2022, the Company and the note holder agreed
to cancel and void previous warrants and entered into a new agreement for 115,185 warrants with an exercise price of 2.50. As of December 31, 2022, the 99,900 principal and the 4,950 overpayment of the note remained outstanding and had accrued interest of 12,462.53. The
warrants discussed above were initially discounted against the notes, subsequent to year end December 31, 2021, they were deemed voided
and new warrants in accordance with the new terms were issued. We assessed the differences in fair value and determined that they were
de minimis and expensed the full value of the new warrants. The noteholder elected to convert the loan into 21,747 shares of common stock
(post reverse stock split) upon the Company s IPO in February 2023. 

29 

On
June 15, 2021, the company entered into a unsecured short term loan agreement with the Investor for an aggregate principal balance of
 34,000, with a one-year maturity date, accruing interest at 5 and imputing an additional 1 interest. 

On
November 19, 2021, 2021, the company entered into an unsecured short term loan agreement with the Investor for an aggregate principal
balance of 5,000, with a one-year maturity date, accruing interest at 5 and imputing an additional 1 interest. 

On
December 13, 2021, the company entered into an unsecured short term loan agreement with the Investor for an aggregate principal balance
of 10,000, with a one-year maturity date, accruing interest at 5 and imputing an additional 1 interest. 

On
October 5, 2022, the Company entered into an exchange agreement with the Investor whereby all of his common stock, 734,493 shares of
common stock (post reverse split shares), were exchanged into 73,449 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that converts to common at a rate of 10 common for one preferred. The Series A
Preferred Stock is the economic equivalent of the common stock but has no voting rights and is subject to a blocker which prohibits
the conversion into common stock if it would result in the Investor owning more than 4.99 of the Company s outstanding common
stock at such time. For a description of the rights and preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock, see Description of
Securities- Series A Convertible Preferred Stock . 

Other
Transactions 

None. 

Director
Independence 

Messrs.
Elsey, Enright and Hanson, three members of our Board of Directors, are independent using the definition of independence under Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) and the standards established by the SEC. 

Policies
and Procedures for Related Party Transactions 

For
purposes of our policy only, a related person transaction is a transaction, arrangement or relationship, or any series of similar transactions,
arrangements or relationships, in which we and any related person are, were or will be participants in which the amount involved exceeds
the lesser of 120,000 or 1 of the average of our total assets at year-end. Transactions involving compensation for services provided
to us as an employee or director are not covered by this policy. A related person is any executive officer, director or beneficial owner
of more than 5 of any class of our voting securities, including any of their immediate family members and any entity owned or controlled
by such persons. 

Under
the policy, if a transaction has been identified as a related person transaction, including any transaction that was not a related person
transaction when originally consummated or any transaction that was not initially identified as a related person transaction prior to
consummation, our management must present information regarding the related person transaction to our audit committee, or, if audit committee
approval would be inappropriate, to another independent body of our Board of Directors, for review, consideration and approval or ratification.
The presentation must include a description of, among other things, the material facts, the interests, direct and indirect, of the related
persons, the benefits to us of the transaction and whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to
or from, as the case may be, an unrelated third party or to or from employees generally. Under the policy, we will collect information
that we deem reasonably necessary from each director, executive officer and, to the extent feasible, significant stockholder to enable
us to identify any existing or potential related-person transactions and to effectuate the terms of the policy. In addition, under our
code of business conduct and ethics, our employees and directors will have an affirmative responsibility to disclose any transaction
or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest. In considering related person transactions,
our audit committee, or other independent body of our Board of Directors, will take into account the relevant available facts and circumstances
including, but not limited to: 

the
 risks, costs and benefits to us; 

the
 impact on a director s independence in the event that the related person is a director, immediate family member of a director
 or an entity with which a director is affiliated; 

the
 availability of other sources for comparable services or products; and 

the
 terms available to or from, as the case may be, unrelated third parties or to or from employees generally. 

The
policy requires that, in determining whether to approve, ratify or reject a related person transaction, our audit committee, or other
independent body of our Board of Directors, must consider, in light of known circumstances, whether the transaction is in, or is not
inconsistent with, our best interests and those of our stockholders, as our audit committee, or other independent body of our Board of
Directors, determines in the good faith exercise of its discretion.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

 To
the Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders
of Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows
for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,
2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for flows for the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical
audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which
they relate. 

As
discussed in Note 2, the Company had a going concern disclosure in the previous year due to continued net losses from operations and
negative cash flows in operations. Auditing management s evaluation of a going concern can be a significant judgment given the
fact that the Company uses management estimates on future revenues and expenses, which are difficult to substantiate. 

We
evaluated the appropriateness of the removal of the going concern, we examined and evaluated the financial information along with management s
plans to mitigate the going concern and management s disclosure on going concern. 

/s/

We
 have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.

 NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 December
31, 2022 and 2021 

related to the achievement of a contract milestone under a contract with a Pharmaceutical company. In compliance with the agreement,
we have met the following milestones receipt of data for analysis; data conversion and staging for ingestion. For the
years-ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our balance sheet reflects customer down payment received in early 2022 and late 2021 as
unearned revenue in the amount of 
and ,
respectively. This unearned revenue represents payments received from a leading rare disease non-profit organization under a
contract with a single deliverable. As is more fully discussed below, we are of the opinion that none of our contracts for products
contain significant financing components that require revenue adjustment under FASB ASC Topic 606. 

Revenue
is recognized based on the following five step model: 

- 
 Identification
 of the contract with a customer 
 This
 step outlines the criteria that must be met when establishing a contract with a customer to supply goods or services 

- 
 Identification
 of the performance obligations in the contract 
 This
 step describes how distinct performance obligations in the contract must be handled 

- 
 Determination
 of the transaction price 
 This
 step outlines what must be considered when establishing the transaction price, which is the amount the business expects to receive
 for transferring the goods and services to the customer 

- 
 Allocation
 of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 
 This
 step outlines guidelines for allocating the transaction price across the contract s separate performance obligations, and is
 what the customer agrees to pay for the goods and services 

- 
 Recognition
 of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation 
 Revenue
 can be recognized as the business meets each performance obligation. This step specifies how that should happen 

Contract
Services 

The
Company anticipates that the majority of revenues to be recognized in the near future will result from our fee for service partnership
offering, designed for biopharmaceutical companies, as well as other organizations, of all sizes that have challenges analyzing data
throughout the drug development process. The Company provides the customer with an analysis of large complex data sets using the Company s
proprietary Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning platform called bfLEAP . This platform is designed to predict targets of
interest, patterns, relationships, and anomalies. The Company believes that there will be additional on-going work requested from partners
therefore the service model utilizes a master services agreement with work or task orders issued for discrete analysis performed at the
discovery, preclinical, or clinical stages of drug development. The Company receives a cash fee and in some instances the potential for
rights to new intellectual property generated from the analysis. 

Collaborative
Arrangements 

The
Company also intends to enter collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies who have drugs that have failed late Phase 2 or
Phase 3 trials. These arrangements could take several forms including true partnerships where BullFrog contributes data analysis using
the bfLEAP platform with the partner contributing the drug candidate and other resources needed to continue development towards
commercialization with BullFrog receiving an equity or royalty right in the commercialized product. In other arrangements the Company
may earn cash payments based on achieving certain milestones as determined under each specific arrangement. 

Acquisition
of Rights to Certain Drugs 

 In
certain circumstances, we may also acquire rights to drugs that are in early-stage clinical trials, use our technology to sponsor and
support a successful later stage precision medicine trial, and divest the asset. The same process may apply to the discovery of new drugs.
In these instances, divestiture may be in the form of an outright sale of all rights or possibly a license to develop and commercialize
enhanced development candidates. License agreements could include developmental and commercial milestones in addition to royalties.

 M in face value of convertible bridge notes, as described in footnote 13. Pursuant to the enhanced terms, the warrants will not be

On
April 11, 2022, the Company entered into an Exclusive placement agent and/or underwriter agreement with WallachBeth Capital LLC in
connection with a proposed private and/or public offerings by the Company. As discussed in Footnote 2, a significant component of
the Company s plan to secure capital is the intention of the Company to seek to be listed on a national exchange through an
initial public offering IPO of its common stock. WallachBeth was engaged in this regard and on April 28, 2022, the

a warrant for each share of common stock issued upon conversion with an exercise price set by the exchange ratio. Due to the IPO price
not yet being probable at year end, no current accounting for these warrants has been journalized.

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470- 20) and Derivatives and Hedging
- Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s
Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ), which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities
and equity. The Company specified that an entity should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year. After adoption
of ASU 2020-06, if the equity securities underlying the conversion option are not readily convertible to cash, and the conversion option
requires gross physical settlement of the underlying shares, the embedded conversion option may not meet the net settlement criterion,
and therefore would not meet the definition of a derivative. Considering that the Common shares of the Company were not publicly traded
as of December 31, 2022, the convertible options are not considered to be readily convertible to cash. In addition, the beneficial conversion
feature was eliminated under ASU 2020-06. Therefore, no derivative liabilities will be triggered from these convertible notes. All conversions
are contingent upon an effective IPO, which had not yet been considered probable.

equal to the Post-Money Valuation Cap divided by the Company Capitalization) or (2) the Discount Price (the price per share
of the Standard Preferred Stock sold in the Equity Financing multiplied by the Discount Rate), whichever calculation results in a
greater number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock

of (i) the Purchase Amount (the Cash-Out Amount or (ii) the amount payable on the number of shares of Common Stock equal
to the Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price (the Conversion Amount ). If any of the Company s securityholders
are given a choice as to the form and amount of Proceeds to be received in a Liquidity Event, the Investor will be given the same choice,
provided that the Investor may not choose to receive a form of consideration that the Investor would be ineligible to receive as a result
of the Investor s failure to satisfy any requirement or limitation generally applicable to the Company s securityholders,
or under any applicable laws.

of such holder s shares of Series A Preferred Stock into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock in an amount
equal to ten shares of common stock for each one share of Series A Preferred Stock surrendered. The Series A Preferred Stock is the
economic equivalent of the common stock but has no voting rights and is subject to a blocker which prohibits the conversion into
common stock if it would result in the Investor owning more than 
of the Company s outstanding common stock at such time. T he Company evaluated the terms of the

 (4) After
 the Company signed two licenses for two drug programs from universities in the first half
 of 2022 it engaged an independent valuation firm to perform an Enterprise-Equity valuation.

that do not expire, that may be used to offset future taxable income, but could be limited under Section 382. The Company has provided
a valuation reserve against the full amount of the net operating loss benefit, since in the opinion of management based upon the earnings
history of the Company; it is more likely than not that the benefits will not be realized. Due to possible significant changes in the
Company s ownership, the future use of its existing net operating losses may be limited. All or portion of the remaining valuation allowance
may be reduced in future years based on an assessment of earnings sufficient to fully utilize these potential tax benefits. 

We
have adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10-25, which provides recognition criteria and a related measurement model for uncertain tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. ASC 740-10-25 requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return
be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax
authorities. 

Tax
position that meets the more likely than not threshold is then measured using a probability weighted approach recognizing the largest
amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company had no tax positions relating
to open income tax returns that were considered to be uncertain. We file income tax returns in
the U.S. and in the state of California and Utah with varying statutes of limitations.

(c)
The Committee shall have the authority to remove any or all of the restrictions on the Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Deferred
Stock Units whenever it may determine that, by reason of changes in Applicable Laws or other changes in circumstances arising after the

8.3
 Restricted Period . With respect to Restricted Awards, the Restricted
Period shall commence on the Grant Date and end at the time or times set forth on a schedule established by the Committee in the applicable
Award Agreement. No Restricted Award may be granted or settled for a fraction of a share of Common Stock. The Committee may, but shall
not be required to, provide for an acceleration of vesting in the terms of any Award Agreement upon the occurrence of a specified event.

 Delivery of Restricted Stock and Settlement of Restricted Stock Units .
 Upon the expiration of the Restricted Period with respect to any shares of Restricted Stock, the restrictions set forth in Section

interest thereon or, at the discretion of the Committee, in shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to such Dividend
Equivalents and the interest thereon, if any; provided, however , that, if explicitly provided in the applicable Award Agreement,
the Committee may, in its sole discretion, elect to pay cash or part cash and part Common Stock in lieu of delivering only shares of
Common Stock for Vested Units. If a cash payment is made in lieu of delivering shares of Common Stock, the amount of such payment shall
be equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock as of the date on which the Restricted Period lapsed in the case of Restricted
Stock Units, or the delivery date in the case of Deferred Stock Units, with respect to each Vested Unit.

agencies have been fully complied with to the satisfaction of the Company and its counsel and (b) if required to do so by the Company,
the Participant has executed and delivered to the Company a letter of investment intent in such form and containing such provisions as
the Committee may require. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to seek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having
jurisdiction over the Plan such authority as may be required to grant Awards and to issue and sell shares of Common Stock upon exercise
of the Awards; provided, however , that this undertaking shall not require the Company to register under the Securities Act the
Plan, any Award or any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Award. If, after reasonable efforts, the Company is unable
to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority which counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance

terms and no adjustment shall be made for, nor shall any Participant be entitled to receive, any dividends (ordinary or extraordinary,
whether in cash, securities or other property) or distributions of other rights for which the record date is prior to the date the certificate
representing Common Stock issuable pursuant to an Award is actually issued, except as provided in Section 14 hereof. 

13.3
 No Employment or Other Service Rights . Nothing
in the Plan or any instrument executed or Award granted pursuant thereto shall confer upon any Participant any right to continue to serve

Affiliate to terminate (a) the employment of an Employee with or without notice and with or without Cause or (b) the service of a Director

service or sickness, or for any other purpose approved by the Company, if the Employee s right to reemployment is guaranteed either

by the terms of an Award Agreement and subject to the discretion of the Committee, the Participant may satisfy any federal, state or
local tax withholding obligation relating to the exercise or acquisition of Common Stock under an Award by any of the following means

of such means: (a) tendering a cash payment; (b) authorizing the Company to withhold shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common
Stock otherwise issuable to the Participant as a result of the exercise or acquisition of Common Stock under the Award, provided,
however , that no shares of Common Stock are withheld with a value exceeding the maximum amount of tax required to be withheld by
law (or such lesser amount as may be necessary to avoid classification of the Stock Award as a liability for financial accounting purposes);
or (c) delivering to the Company previously owned and unencumbered shares of Common Stock of the Company.

that such adjustment is in the best interests of the Company or its Affiliates, the Committee shall, in the case of Incentive Stock Options,
ensure that any adjustments under this Section 14 will not constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the Incentive Stock Options
within the meaning of Section 424(h)(3) of the Code and in the case of Non-qualified Stock Options, ensure that any adjustments under
this Section 14 will not constitute a modification of such Non-qualified Stock Options within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.

to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. The Company shall give each Participant notice of an adjustment hereunder and, upon notice, such
adjustment shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes.

may cancel the Option or Stock Appreciation Right without the payment of consideration therefor.
