1. BUSINESS 

OVERVIEW 

HUMBL,
Inc. HUMBL or the Company is a Web 3, digital commerce company that operates a platform to connect consumers,
businesses and governments in the digital economy. HUMBL provides simple tools and packaging for complex new technologies such as blockchain,
in the same way that previous cycles of e-commerce and the cloud were more simply packaged by companies such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon
and Netflix over the past several decades. The Company through its product offerings is looking to simplify and package the digital economy
for consumers, corporations and governments. 

The
goal of HUMBL is to provide ready built tools and platforms for consumers and merchants to seamlessly participate in the digital economy.
HUMBL is built on a patent-pending, decentralized technology stack that utilizes both core and partner technologies to provide faster
connections to the digital economy and each other. 

The
Company is organized into two divisions: a) HUMBL Consumer, and b) HUMBL Commercial. Through these two divisions the Company offers its
core products and services. The majority of the Company s operations prior to 2022 were focused on the consumer division. 

HUMBL
 A Web 3 Commerce Platform 

HUMBL
was founded to deliver an integrated, Web 3 digital commerce platform for consumers, merchants and governments. HUMBL has delivered one
of the first integrated technology environments in which a digital wallet, search engine, social media and marketplace listings can be
used together by consumers in one place. The HUMBL platform is comprised of the following key components described below.

HUMBL
Wallet 

The
HUMBL Wallet is the centerpiece of the Web 3 consumer experience on the HUMBL platform. The HUMBL Wallet is self-custodied by the individual;
ensuring that they have full control over their digital assets and private keys.

 Table of Contents 

Customers
can use the HUMBL Wallet to send and receive digital assets, interact on the HUMBL Social platform, perform web searches on the HUMBL
Search Engine, store and manage their NFTs, consume content via MP4 multimedia player and more. 

The
HUMBL Wallet drives revenue through: a) digital asset swaps, in which the customer can use the self-custodied HUMBL digital wallet to
swap from one digital asset to another on the Ethereum blockchain, and b) purchasing crypto through Sardine, a third-party service that
allows customers to buy digital assets with credit cards. 

The
HUMBL Wallet is also connected to the BLOCKS Registry, a decentralized blockchain registry that allows customers to authenticate digital
items, such as NFTs, and track the chain of custody to ensure reduced fraud, forgery and theft in the digital markets. 

HUMBL
Wallet customers have the obligation to perform their own tax record keeping and tracking of assets and swaps in the self-custodied wallet;
as well as backup of their private keys, to ensure the recoverability, data security and storage of their digital assets. 

The
HUMBL Wallet is equipped with 2-factor authentication; as well as biometric security features, which are handled by the handset and its
manufacturer. HUMBL does not store or have access to any biometric information related to its verified users. 

The
HUMBL Wallet uses SumSub, a third-party service provider, to perform KYC / KYB and authenticate customers. HUMBL does not capture or
store consumers information on HUMBL s servers, except for their corresponding name, wallet address and email address for
basic communications with the verified user. HUMBL does not resell its customers data. 

The
HUMBL Wallet is available in over 130 countries and is not available in any OFAC Countries. 

HUMBL
Search Engine 

The
HUMBL Search Engine is available via the HUMBL Wallet and the HUMBL website. The HUMBL Search Engine allows customers to search for standard
Web 2 content such as news, images and video search capabilities. The company also recently completed the development of its HUMBL Ads
portal, which can be used to customize advertising programs for clients. This includes traditional search advertising such as display
ads, location targeting and cost-per-click performance advertising. 

The
HUMBL Search Engine also offers Web 3 blockchain-based search features such as the ability to search major NFTs across Ethereum, Polygon,
BLOCKS, Gnosis and Solana. Consumers are able to confirm that certain NFTs have been Verified by BLOCKS to protect against
the fraud and forgery in the NFT market. The search engine also shows customers where certain NFTs are available for purchase across
various marketplaces. 

HUMBL
Tickets 

HUMBL
Tickets is initially focused on the offering of secondary (resale) tickets to thousands of live events across North America. HUMBL Tickets
inventory listings and ticket fulfillment are provided by Ticket Evolution and HUMBL earns a commission for each sale through its website. 

The
ticketing content provided on HUMBL Tickets spans across major live music, sports, festivals and events in multiple countries. HUMBL
Tickets advertises its services primarily across social media, including its own HUMBL Social platform. 

HUMBL
is also exploring the development of primary ticketing and peer-to-peer ticketing sales via blockchain technology and dynamic QR codes,
with ticket storage inside the HUMBL Wallet as future digital collectibles; along with authenticated content, ratings and reviews from
ticketed events on the HUMBL Social platform via verified profiles, commemorative icons and attendance badges.

 Table of Contents 

HUMBL
Marketplace 

The
HUMBL Marketplace was designed to pair authenticated buyers and sellers in verified, digital commerce. The HUMBL Marketplace currently
works with clients such as professional athletes, brands, and marketing and talent agencies, to provide sports merchandise ranging from
autographed jerseys, bats, balls, helmets, photos and more. 

The
HUMBL Marketplace mitigates forgeries by pairing physical merchandise with digital certificates of registration. Merchandise is made
available on the HUMBL platform and is verified, registered, and cataloged on the blockchain. 

The
HUMBL Marketplace also allows for the minting and listing of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as digital collectibles, that allow pre-approved
individuals to monetize their digital images, multimedia content and catalogues on the blockchain. 

HUMBL
is a software platform and does not act as a broker, financial institution, or creditor for digital collectibles. We facilitate transactions
between the buyer and seller in the auction/sale process, but we are not a party to any agreement between the buyer and seller or between
any users. 

HUMBL
Social 

HUMBL
Social is one of the world s first user-verified social media platforms. The social media platform is available via web browser
and the HUMBL Wallet. The goal of HUMBL Social is to provide real people, real profiles and real merchants with a place to connect on
the worldwide web. 

HUMBL
Social supports only verified user profiles, to ensure authenticity of the platform. This helps to reduce the fake profiles, product
ratings and reviews that have plagued major Web 2 social media platforms due to the allowance of anonymous profiles and non-verified
sellers. The HUMBL Social platform is available in over 130+ countries via the HUMBL Wallet and web browser. 

HUMBL
Metaverse Stores 

HUMBL
has created technology to build customized metaverse stores for brands, athletes, entertainers and celebrities. HUMBL s first metaverse
store was created for Major League Baseball player Ke Bryan Hayes and his father Charlie Hayes, a retired Major League Baseball
player. The brand metaverse store is called the House of Hayes and supports the development of an immersive player experience,
in which customers can navigate a simulated environment of historical artwork and current digital collectibles. Custom artwork was provided
by Topps Sports Artist of the Year Lauren Taylor, in the form of digital collectibles that rotated on screens throughout
the environment. Endorsement sporting goods brands of Ke Bryan Hayes, such as Wilson, Franklin and Old Hickory, also supported
product placement and sell-through environments for products such as authentic baseball bats and gloves. An immersive Wilson Amphitheatre
was also created for multimedia press conferences or media interactions with Ke Bryan Hayes avatar. 

HUMBL
Blockchain Services 

HUMBL
Blockchain Services HBS was formed as part of the Company s asset acquisition of BizSecure on February 12, 2022.
Recognizing the opportunities for governments and commercial enterprises to incorporate blockchain and distributed ledger technologies DLT ), HBS is focused on working with clients to identify problems and develop solutions that build upon the various capabilities
the Company has and continues to develop.

 Table of Contents 

Our
solutions enable municipalities, government agencies, and other commercial entities the ability to offer mobile IDs and other credential
verification services to their constituents. We continue to make significant investments to leverage our existing technologies and further
expand our DLT capabilities. 

Components
of the HUMBL Wallet can be used by HBS to white label a Powered By environment for local, state or national government
clients that may want to move to digital or blockchain-based registry formats of their transactions, record keeping and / or payments
from citizens, corporations, or government departments. 

An
example of this is a pilot program that HUMBL is currently developing with the County of Santa Cruz (CA), in which HUMBL and the County
are working to scope the development of a digital wallet in which citizens can more easily and effectively receive government services
access via digital technologies. 

Organizational
History 

We
were formed under the name Ponca Acquisition Corporation in Nevada on May 3, 2000, as a blank check development stage company
that indicated that our business plan was to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies. Following a
series of name changes and changes in the focus of our business, on November 18, 2008, we filed Form 15 with the SEC to terminate its
registration with the SEC. 

On

a 1:4 reverse split, change our name to HUMBL, Inc., increase our authorized common stock to 7,450,000,000 shares, reduce our authorized
number of blank check preferred stock from 25 million to 10 million and designate a Series B and Series C Preferred Stock.

physical goods on the blockchain. HUMBL plans to pair physical merchandise, alongside HUMBL technologies such as the HUMBL wallet, search
engine, tickets and NFTs, to deliver an integrated digital experience for customers. Brian Meltzer was hired by the Company to run the

Significant
Vendor Relationships 

We
have established contractual relationships with the following companies that we consider to be material to providing our core products: 

We
need in each country or region a payment processing company to allow the consumers to pay online the merchants using our software services.
In the United States we have a Platform Connect Agreement and Services Agreement with Stripe, Inc. as well a Referral Agreement with
Wyre, Inc. We have entered into the standard forms of agreements that these companies offer to companies such as ours that promote online
purchase of goods and services. 

We
utilize Very Good Security VGS ), a company that encrypts debit and credit card data as well as banking information, that
allows us not to hold onto, see or decrypt any of the raw credit card or banking data from our customers since this information is handled
directly by VGS which encrypts all of it and securely sends this data directly to Stripe. 

We
utilize SumSub to provide KYC/KYB and user verification for our HUMBL Wallet and HUMBL Social platforms. 

Competition 

Each
of our principal verticals is highly competitive. Throughout the globe, we currently face substantial competition from other service
providers that offer blockchain wallets, search engines, ticketing, online marketplaces, social media platforms, and ecommerce websites.
We compete primarily on the basis of availability of services and products, unique product offerings and price. 

HUMBL
Wallet competes with Metamask and Coinbase. HUMBL Search Engine competes with Google and Microsoft. HUMBL Tickets competes with StubHub
and Ticketmaster. HUMBL Marketplace competes with eBay. HUMBL Social competes with Twitter. HUMBL Metaverse Stores competes with traditional
ecommerce stores. 

Employees
and Human Capital 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had 16 full time employees. None of our employees or personnel is represented by a labor union, and we consider
our employee/personnel relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, particularly for software
development and other technical staff. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining,
incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. 

Implications
of Being an Emerging Growth Company 

As
a company with less than 1.0 billion in revenue during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth
company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to as the Securities Act, as modified
by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified
reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable, in general, to public companies that are not emerging growth
companies. These provisions include: 

Reduced disclosure about
 our executive compensation arrangements; 

No non-binding shareholder
 advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; 

Exemption from the auditor
 attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and 

Reduced disclosure of financial
 information in this prospectus, limited to two years of audited financial information and two years of selected financial information. 

As
a smaller reporting company, each of the foregoing exemptions is currently available to us. We may take advantage of these exemptions
for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company
if we have more than 1.0 billion in annual revenues as of the end of a fiscal year, if we are deemed to be a large-accelerated filer
under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or if we issue more than 1.0 billion of non- convertible debt over a three-year-period. 

The
JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting
standards applicable to public companies. We have elected the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting
standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the Act until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii)
affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements
may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Our
operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below. You should consider
and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making an investment decision. The risks described
below are not the only ones we face. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently
known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or
results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should not interpret our disclosure of
any of the following risks to imply that such risks have not already materialized. 

RISK
FACTORS 

Investing
in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together
with all of the other information included or referred to in this prospectus, before purchasing shares of our common stock. There are
numerous and varied risks that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial
condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline
and investors in our common stock could lose all or part of their investment. 

Risks
Related to Our Company and Our Business 

Our
operating losses and working capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we do not
continue as a going concern, investors could lose their entire investment. 

Our
operating losses and working capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have an
accumulated deficit of (99,218,747) as of December 31, 2022 as well as a net loss of 48,567,938 and 49,656,004 for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We may never achieve profitability. If we do not generate sufficient revenues, do not achieve
profitability and do not have other sources of financing for our business, we may have to curtail or cease our development plans and
operations, which could cause investors to lose the entire amount of their investment. 

We
may not be able to raise capital when needed, if at all, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our level of marketing efforts
to expand the number of customers and merchants using our products and acquisition of suitable target companies and could cause our business
plan to fail. 

We
will need substantial additional funding to increase our customer base and pursue our acquisition of companies and business units that
meet our desired standards. There are no assurances that future funding will be available on favorable terms or at all. The failure to
fund our operating and capital requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to reduce our efforts to enlist
more customers and merchants to use our technology and to delay, reduce or eliminate our acquisition strategy. Any of these events could
significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. 

We
may acquire other assets or businesses, or form collaborations or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm
our operating results, dilute our stockholders ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense. 

As
part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of businesses and assets or enter into strategic alliances and collaborations,
to initiate and then expand our operations. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective
basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, any of which could have a detrimental effect
on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have limited experience with acquiring other companies and assets
and limited experience with forming strategic alliances and collaborations. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates,
and if we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may
incur additional debt or assume unknown or contingent liabilities in connection therewith. Integration of an acquired company or assets
may also disrupt ongoing operations, require the hiring of additional personnel and the implementation of additional internal systems
and infrastructure, especially the acquisition of commercial assets, and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing
our existing business. We may not be able to find suitable strategic alliance or collaboration partners or identify other investment
opportunities, and we may experience losses related to any such investments. 

10 

 Table of Contents 

To
finance any acquisitions or collaborations, we may choose to issue debt or equity securities as consideration. Any such issuance of securities
would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other
assets or companies or fund a transaction using our stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional
funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us,
or at all. 

Current
global financial conditions have been characterized by increased volatility which could negatively impact our business, prospects, liquidity
and financial condition. 

Current
global financial conditions and recent market events have been characterized by increased volatility and the resulting tightening of
the credit and capital markets has reduced the amount of available liquidity and overall economic activity. We cannot guaranty that debt
or equity financing, the ability to borrow funds or cash generated by operations will be available or sufficient to meet or satisfy our
initiatives, objectives or requirements. Our inability to access sufficient amounts of capital on terms acceptable to us for our operations
will negatively impact our business, prospects, liquidity and financial condition. 

We
are growing the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing any growth we may achieve. 

As
of the date of this annual report, we have 15 full-time employees. As our growth plans proceed and development and commercialization
plans and strategies develop, we expect to need additional development, managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial, accounting,
legal, and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management. Our management may
not be able to accommodate those added responsibilities, and our failure to do so could prevent us from effectively managing future growth,
if any, and successfully growing our Company. 

Our
potential for rapid growth and our entry into new markets make it difficult for us to evaluate our current and future business prospects,
and we may be unable to effectively manage any growth associated with these new markets, which may increase the risk of your investment
and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 

Our
entry into new markets as we seek to expand globally the adoption of our products and services may place a significant strain on our
resources and increase demands on our executive management, personnel and systems, and our operational, administrative and financial
resources may be inadequate. We may also not be able to effectively manage any expanded operations or achieve planned growth on a timely
or profitable basis, particularly if the number of customers using our technology significantly increases or their demands and needs
change as our business expands. If we are unable to manage expanded operations effectively, we may experience operating inefficiencies,
the quality of our products and services could deteriorate, and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.

If
we are unable to develop and maintain our brand and reputation for our service and product offerings, our business and prospects could
be materially harmed. 

Our
business and prospects depend, in part, on developing and then maintaining and strengthening our brand and reputation in the markets
we will serve and for the companies we acquire. If problems arise with our future products or services, our brand and reputation could
be diminished. If we fail to develop, promote and maintain our brand and reputation successfully, our business and prospects could be
materially harmed. 

Any
failure to protect our future intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our technology and our brand. 

Our
success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights of the companies we expect to
acquire. We expect to rely upon a combination of trademark and trade secret laws, as well as license and other contractual provisions,
to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection
and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. To the extent
that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties may gain access to our proprietary
information, develop and market solutions similar to ours or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially harm our
business. The failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our
expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects us to additional risks. 

We
may have limited or no experience in our newer markets, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings,
which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service
disruptions or failures or other quality issues.. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations,
and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts
we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. 

Our
financial results fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast, and this may cause a decline in the trading price of our stock. 

Our
revenues, expenses and operating results are difficult to predict given our limited history of current operations. We expect that our
operating results will continue to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors
include, but are not limited to: 

our
 ability to increase our brand awareness; 

our
 ability to attract new customers; 

our
 ability to increase our customer base; 

the
 amount and timing of costs relating to the expansion of our operations, including sales and marketing expenditures; 

our
 ability to introduce new mobile payment offerings or customer services in a competitive environment; 

technical
 difficulties consumers might encounter in using our mobile apps; and 

our
 ability to manage third-party outsourced operations; 

Due
to all of these factors, our operating results may fall below the expectations of investors, which could cause a decline in the trading
price of our common stock.

 Table of Contents 

We
intend to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and adversely impact our business and operating results. 

We
intend to attempt to acquire complementary e-commerce businesses and to support the transition and integration of acquired operations
with our ongoing business as a part of our growth strategy. Other than as disclosed herein, we currently have no binding commitments
or agreements with respect to any such acquisitions and there can be no assurance that we will eventually consummate any acquisitions.
The process of integrating acquired assets into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may
absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. In addition, we
have limited experience in performing acquisitions and managing growth. There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of any
acquisition will be realized. In addition, future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the
incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which
could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial position. In addition, acquisitions also involve other risks,
including risks inherent in entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and the potential loss of key employees. 

Our
plans for expansion cannot be implemented if we lose our key personnel or cannot recruit additional personnel. 

We
depend substantially on the continued services, specialized knowledge and performance of our senior management, particularly Brian Foote,
our President and CEO, Jeffrey Hinshaw, our COO and CFO, and Michele Rivera, our Vice President, Global Partnerships. While we have employment
agreements with all these executives, those employment agreements do not prevent such employees from terminating their employment with
us at any time. As a result, these executives may elect to pursue other opportunities at any time. If one or more of these individuals
choose to leave our company, we may lose a significant number of supplier relationships and operating expertise which they have developed
over many years and which would be difficult to replace. The loss of the services of any executive officer or other key employee could
hurt our business. 

In
addition, as our business expands, we will need to add new information technology and engineering personnel to maintain and expand our
website and systems and customer support personnel to serve our growing customer base. If we are unable to hire and successfully train
employees or contractors in these areas, users of our website may have negative experiences and we may lose customers, which would diminish
the value of our brand and harm our business. The market for recruiting qualified information technology and other personnel is extremely
competitive, and we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining employees. Should we fail to retain or attract qualified
personnel, we may not be able to compete successfully or implement our plans for expansion. 

We
have an evolving business model with still untested growth initiatives. 

We
have an evolving business model and intend to implement new strategies to grow our business in the future. Among other strategies for
organic growth, we intend to recruit country partners to sell our mobile financial services. There can be no assurance that we will be
successful in developing new product categories or in entering new specialty markets or in implementing any other growth strategies.
Similarly, there can be no assurance that we already have or will be able to obtain or retain any employees, consultants or other resources
with any specialized skills or relationships to successfully implement our strategies in the future. 

We
rely on third-party systems to conduct our business and relationships with payment processors, advertisers, third party sellers of our
mobile apps, and our revenues and market share may decrease if these third-party relationship and systems are unavailable in the future
or if they no longer offer quality performance. 

We
rely on third-party computer systems and third-party service providers, including payment services such as Stripe, and Wyre for credit
card verifications and confirmations, to host our website and to advertise and deliver the products sold on our website to customers.
We also rely on third-party licenses for components of the software underlying our technology platform. Any interruption in our ability
to obtain the products or services of these or other third parties or deterioration in their performance could impair the timing and
quality of our own service. If our service providers fail to deliver high-quality services in a timely manner to our customers, our services
will not meet the expectations of our customers and our reputation and brand will be damaged. Furthermore, if our arrangements with any
of these third parties are terminated, we may not find an alternate source of systems support on a timely basis or on terms as advantageous
to us. In addition, our contracts or arrangements with suppliers do not provide for the continuation of particular pricing practices,
for the availability of any specific services and generally may be terminated by either party. If we are unable to develop and maintain
relationships with these third-party suppliers that will allow us to obtain sufficient levels of service on acceptable commercial terms,
such inability could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

 Table of Contents 

We
are subject to cyber security risks and risks of data loss or other security breaches. 

Our
business involves the storage and transmission of users proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk
of loss or misuse of this information, and to resulting claims, fines, and litigation. We have been subjected to a variety of cyber-attacks,
which have increased in number and variety over time. We believe our systems are probed by potential hackers virtually 24/7, and we expect
the problem will continue to grow worse over time. Cyber-attacks may target us, our customers, our suppliers, banks, credit card processors,
delivery services, e-commerce in general or the communication infrastructure on which we depend. Any compromise of our security could
result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a
loss of confidence in our security measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.
Moreover, any insurance coverage we may carry may be inadequate to cover the expenses and other potential financial exposure we could
face as a result of a cyber-attack or data breach. 

We
may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors including larger, well-established and well-financed mobile
app companies. 

Many
of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly
greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may be able to devote greater resources
to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote substantially more resources to systems development
than we do. Increased competition may result in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and a diminished brand franchise. We
cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. 

Our
business depends on effective marketing, including marketing via email and social networking messaging, and we intend to increase our
spending on marketing and branding, which may adversely affect our financial results. 

We
depend on effective marketing to attract customers and merchants. We depend on email and social networking messaging to promote our site
and offerings and to generate a substantial portion of our revenues. If we are unable to develop, implement and maintain effective and
efficient cost-effective advertising and marketing programs, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.
Further, as part of our growth strategies, we intend to increase our spending on marketing and branding initiatives significantly, which
may adversely affect our financial results. There is no assurance that any increase in our marketing or branding expenditures will result
in increased market shares or will ultimately have a positive effect on our financial results. 

If
we do not respond to rapid technological changes, our services could become obsolete and we could lose customers. 

To
remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our e-commerce businesses. We may face
material delays in introducing new services, products and enhancements. If this happens, our customers may forego the use of our websites
and use those of our competitors. If competitors introduce new products and services using new technologies or if new industry standards
and practices emerge, our existing technology and systems may become obsolete. Our failure to respond to technological change or to adequately
maintain, upgrade and develop our computer network and the systems used to process customers orders and payments could harm our
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 

Use
of social media may adversely impact our reputation. 

There
has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices, including blogs, social media websites and other
forms of internet-based communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Consumers
value readily available information concerning retailers, manufacturers, and their goods and services and often act on such information
without further investigation, authentication and without regard to its accuracy. The availability of information on social media platforms
and devices is virtually immediate as is its impact. Social media platforms and devices immediately publish the content their subscribers
and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. The opportunity for dissemination of information,
including inaccurate information, is seemingly limitless and readily available. Information concerning our company may be posted on such
platforms and devices at any time. Information posted may be adverse to our interests, may be inaccurate, and may harm our performance,
prospects or business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Such platforms also could
be used for the dissemination of trade secret information or otherwise compromise valuable company assets, all of which could harm our
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

We
are subject to payments-related risks. 

We
accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, and debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing),
gift cards, direct debit from a customer s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For
existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements
(including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use
of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other
fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain
Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, and debit cards., electronic
checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide
these services to us. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements,
and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply.
If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable
for card issuing banks costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card
payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating
results could be adversely affected. 

In
addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer
money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. In these jurisdictions,
we may be subject to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation
of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws
and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy and information security, and electronic
fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements
and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services. 

If
we do not begin to generate significant revenues, we will still need to raise additional capital to meet our long-term business requirements.
Any such capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain and would likely dilute current stockholders ownership interests.
If we are unable to secure additional financing in the future, we will not be able to continue as a going concern. 

If
we do not begin to generate significant revenues from our operations we will need additional capital, which may not be available on reasonable
terms or at all. The raising of additional capital will dilute current stockholders ownership interests. We may need to raise
additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to meet various objectives including, but not limited to: 

maintaining
 enough working capital to run our business; 

pursuing
 growth opportunities, including more rapid expansion; 

acquiring
 complementary businesses and technologies; 

making
 capital improvements to improve our infrastructure; 

responding
 to competitive pressures;

 Table of Contents 

complying
 with regulatory requirements for advertising or taxation; and 

maintaining
 compliance with applicable laws. 

Any
additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-linked securities may dilute current stockholders ownership percentages
and could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of our equity securities because our assets would be owned by a larger pool
of outstanding equity. The terms of those securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors,
and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further
dilutive effect that is different from or in addition to that reflected in the capitalization described in this report. 

Further,
any additional debt or equity financing that we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to
obtain required additional capital, we may have to curtail our growth plans or cut back on existing business and we may not be able to
continue operating if we do not generate sufficient revenues from operations needed to stay in business. 

We
may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities
law compliance fees and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we
issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition. 

Any
failure to protect our future intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our technology and our brand. 

Our
success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights of the companies we expect to
acquire. We expect to rely upon a combination of trademark and trade secret laws, as well as license and other contractual provisions,
to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection
and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. To the extent
that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties may gain access to our proprietary
information, develop and market solutions similar to ours or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially harm our
business. The failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our
international operations expose us to a number of risks. 

We
expect that our current limited international activities will grow significantly. In certain international market segments, we have relatively
little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It can be costly to establish,
develop, and maintain international operations and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable
on a sustained basis. 

In
addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including: 

local economic and political conditions; 

government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions
(such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions
on foreign ownership; 

restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and
content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying
rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property
rights;

Whether
a particular non-fungible token (NFT) or other crypto assets is a security in any relevant jurisdiction is subject to a
high degree of uncertainty, and if we are unable to properly characterize an NFT or other crypto asset, we may be subject to regulatory
scrutiny, inquiries, investigations, fines, and other penalties, which may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial
condition. 

The
SEC and its staff have taken the position that certain crypto assets (which includes NFTs) fall within the definition of a security 
under the U.S. federal securities laws. The legal test for determining whether any given crypto asset is a security is a highly complex,
fact-driven analysis that evolves over time, and the outcome is difficult to predict. The SEC generally does not provide advance guidance
or confirmation on the status of any particular crypto asset as a security. Furthermore, the SEC s views in this area have evolved
over time and it is difficult to predict the direction or timing of any continuing evolution. It is also possible that a change in the
governing administration or the appointment of new SEC commissioners could substantially impact the views of the SEC and its staff. For
example, Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly remarked on the need for further regulatory oversight on crypto assets, crypto trading, and
lending platforms by the SEC. Public statements by senior officials at the SEC indicate that the SEC does not intend to take the position
that Bitcoin or Ethereum are securities (in their current form). Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only crypto assets as to which senior officials
at the SEC have publicly expressed such a view. Moreover, such statements are not official policy statements by the SEC and reflect only
the speakers views, which are not binding on the SEC or any other agency or court and cannot be generalized to any other crypto
asset. With respect to all other crypto assets, there is currently no certainty under the applicable legal test that such assets are
not securities, notwithstanding the conclusions we may draw based on our risk-based assessment regarding the likelihood that a particular
crypto asset could be deemed a security under applicable laws. Similarly, though the SEC s Strategic Hub for Innovation
and Financial Technology published a framework for analyzing whether any given crypto asset is a security in April 2019, this framework
is also not a rule, regulation or statement of the SEC and is not binding on the SEC.

 Table of Contents 

Several
foreign jurisdictions have taken a broad-based approach to classifying crypto assets as securities, while other foreign
jurisdictions, such as Switzerland, Malta, and Singapore, have adopted a narrower approach. As a result, certain crypto assets may be
deemed to be a security under the laws of some jurisdictions but not others. Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the
future, adopt additional laws, regulations, or directives that affect the characterization of crypto assets as securities. 

The
classification of a crypto asset as a security under applicable law has wide-ranging implications for the regulatory obligations that
flow from the offer and sale of such assets. For example, a crypto asset that is a security in the United States may generally only be
offered or sold in the United States pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC or in an offering that qualifies for an
exemption from registration. Persons that effect transactions in crypto assets that are securities in the United States may be subject
to registration with the SEC as a broker or dealer. Platforms that bring together purchasers and sellers
to trade crypto assets that are securities in the United States are generally subject to registration as national securities exchanges,
or must qualify for an exemption, such as by being operated by a registered broker-dealer as an ATS in compliance with rules for ATSs.
Persons facilitating clearing and settlement of securities may be subject to registration with the SEC as a clearing agency. Foreign
jurisdictions may have similar licensing, registration, and qualification requirements. 

We
have policies and procedures to analyze whether each NFT that we seek to facilitate listing and sale on our platform could be deemed
to be a security under applicable laws. Our policies and procedures do not constitute a legal standard but rather represent
our company-developed model, which permits us to make a risk-based assessment regarding the likelihood that a particular NFT could be
deemed a security under applicable laws. Regardless of our conclusions, we could be subject to legal or regulatory action
in the event the SEC, a state or foreign regulatory authority, or a court were to determine that an NFT listed and sold on our platform
is a security under applicable laws. Because our platform is not registered or licensed with the SEC or foreign authorities
as a broker-dealer, national securities exchange, or ATS (or foreign equivalents), and we do not seek to register or rely on an exemption
from such registration or license to facilitate the offer and sale of NFTs on our platform, we only permit listing on our platform of
those NFTs for which we determine there are reasonably strong arguments to conclude that the NFT is not a security. We believe that our
process reflects a comprehensive and thoughtful analysis and is reasonably designed to facilitate consistent application of available
legal guidance to crypto assets to facilitate informed risk-based business judgment. However, we recognize that the application of securities
laws to the specific facts and circumstances of crypto assets may be complex and subject to change, and that a listing determination
does not guarantee any conclusion under the U.S. federal securities laws. We expect our risk assessment policies and procedures to continuously
evolve to take into account case law, facts, and developments in technology. 

There
can be no assurances that we will properly characterize any given NFT as a security or non-security for purposes of determining whether
our platform will allow the listing of such NFT, or that the SEC, foreign regulatory authority, or a court, if the question was presented
to it, would agree with our assessment. If the SEC, state or foreign regulatory authority, or a court were to determine that NFTs offered
or sold on our platform are securities, we would not be able to offer such NFTs until we are able to do so in a compliant manner. A determination
by the SEC, a state or foreign regulatory authority, or a court that an NFT listed and sold on our platform was a security may also result
in us determining that it is advisable to remove NFTs from our platform that have similar characteristics to the NFT that was determined
to be a security. In addition, we could be subject to judicial or administrative sanctions for failing to offer or sell the NFT in compliance
with the registration requirements, or for acting as a broker, dealer, or national securities exchange without appropriate registration.
Such an action could result in injunctions, cease and desist orders, as well as civil monetary penalties, fines, and disgorgement, criminal
liability, and reputational harm. Customers that purchased such NFTs on our platform and suffered losses could also seek to rescind a
transaction that we facilitated as the basis that it was conducted in violation of applicable law, which could subject us to significant
liability. We may also be required to cease facilitating transactions in other similar NFTs, which could negatively impact our business,
operating results, and financial condition.

Our
failure to safeguard and manage our and our customers crypto assets could adversely impact our business, operating results, and
financial condition. 

We
have never provided custody of any crypto assets purchased through our platform. Custody of crypto assets on our platform is performed
by Wyre, a third-party partner. On January 31, 2023, we removed the HUMBL Pay app from the Apple and Google app stores. By removing the
HUMBL Pay app, we removed the ability for customers to purchase and hold new crypto assets through Wyre. We have requested all customers
remove all funds from the HUMBL Pay app and migrate to the HUMBL Wallet. We still in the process of completing this migration. The HUMBL
Wallet is entirely non-custodial with all customers holding and managing their own private keys. As our business continues to grow and
we expand our product and service offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls and ensure that our partners
do the same. Our success and the success of our offerings requires significant public confidence in our and our partners ability
to properly manage customers balances. In addition, we are dependent on our partners operations, liquidity, and financial
condition for the proper maintenance, use, and safekeeping of these customer assets. We believe our policies and procedures protect us
from material risks surrounding the safeguarding of crypto assets and conflicts of interest. However, any material failure by us or our
partners to maintain the necessary controls, policies, procedures or to manage the crypto assets we hold for our own investment and operating
purposes could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. Further, any material failure by us or our
partners to maintain the necessary controls or to manage customer crypto assets and funds appropriately and in compliance with applicable
regulatory requirements could result in reputational harm, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, significant financial losses,
lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our and our partners products, and result in significant penalties and fines
and additional restrictions, which could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, because
custodially held crypto assets may be considered to be the property of a bankruptcy estate, in the event of a bankruptcy, the crypto
assets Wyre holds in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings and such customers could be treated
as our general unsecured creditors. Our no longer offering custodial services through Wyre may make our offerings less attractive and
any failure to increase our customer base, discontinuation or reduction in use of our platform and products by existing customers as
a result could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. 

Further,
we place great importance on safeguarding crypto assets custodied by Wyre and keeping them bankruptcy remote from our general creditors.
We believe UCC Article 8 applies to custodied crypto assets the same legal protection that our institutional custody and prime broker
clients also rely upon. UCC Article 8 provides that financial assets held by Wyre are not property of Wyre and not subject to the claims
of its general creditors. In light of UCC Article 8, we believe that a court would not treat custodied crypto assets as part of our general
estate; however, due to the novelty of crypto assets, courts have not yet considered this type of treatment for custodied crypto assets. 

Our
security technology is designed to prevent, detect, and mitigate inappropriate access to our systems, by internal or external threats.
We believe we have developed and maintained administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to comply with applicable legal
requirements and industry standards. However, it is nevertheless possible that hackers, employees or service providers acting contrary
to our policies, or others could circumvent these safeguards to improperly access our systems or documents, or the systems or documents
of our business partners, agents, or service providers, and improperly access, obtain, misuse customer crypto assets and funds. The methods
used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may
be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. Any loss of customer cash or crypto assets could result in a subsequent
lapse in insurance coverage, which could cause a substantial business disruption, adverse reputational impact, inability to compete with
our competitors, and regulatory investigations, inquiries, or actions. Additionally, transactions undertaken through our websites or
other electronic channels may create risks of fraud, hacking, unauthorized access or acquisition, and other deceptive practices. Any
security incident resulting in a compromise of customer assets could result in substantial costs to us and require us to notify impacted
individuals, and in some cases regulators, of a possible or actual incident, expose us to regulatory enforcement actions, including substantial
fines, limit our ability to provide services, subject us to litigation, significant financial losses, damage our reputation, and adversely
affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows .

The
theft, loss, or destruction of private keys required to access any crypto assets held in custody for our own account or for our customers
may be irreversible. If we are unable to access our private keys or if we experience a hack or other data loss relating to our ability
to access any crypto assets, it could cause regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm, and other losses. 

Crypto
assets are generally controllable only by the possessor of the unique private key relating to the digital wallet in which the crypto
assets are held. While blockchain protocols typically require public addresses to be published when used in a transaction, private keys
must be safeguarded and kept private in order to prevent a third party from accessing the crypto assets held in such a wallet. To the
extent that any of the private keys relating to our wallets containing crypto assets held for our own account or for our customers is
lost, destroyed, or otherwise compromised or unavailable, and no backup of the private key is accessible, we will be unable to access
the crypto assets held in the related wallet. Further, we cannot provide assurance that our wallet will not be hacked or compromised.
Crypto assets and blockchain technologies have been, and may in the future be, subject to security breaches, hacking, or other malicious
activities. Any loss of private keys relating to, or hack or other compromise of, digital wallets used to store our customers 
crypto assets could adversely affect our customers ability to access or sell their crypto assets, require us to reimburse our
customers for their losses, and subject us to significant financial losses in addition to losing customer trust in us and our products.
As such, any loss of private keys due to a hack, employee or service provider misconduct or error, or other compromise by third parties
could hurt our brand and reputation, result in significant losses, and adversely impact our business. 

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock 

Our
securities are Penny Stock and subject to specific rules governing their sale to investors. 

Under
SEC Rule 15g-9 we are a penny stock, which is defined as any equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00
per share or with an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a
penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require that a broker or dealer approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks;
and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of
the penny stock to be purchased. 

To
approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment
experience objectives of the person; and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that
person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions
in penny stocks. 

The
broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to
the penny stock market, which, in highlight form sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination;
and that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. 

Generally,
brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules. This may make it more
difficult for Company s shareholders to sell shares of our common stock. 

Disclosure
also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions
payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies
available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent
price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.

Our
OTC listing may be removed from the OTCQB marketplace 

On
March 14, 2023, we received notice from OTC Markets of non-compliance with the listing standards of the OTCQB marketplace. The OTCQB
listing standards require that the minimum closing bid price of our common stock must be above 0.01 per share on at least one of the
prior thirty consecutive calendar days. We have a cure period of 90 days ending on June 12, 2023 during which the closing bid price of
our common stock must be 0.01 or greater for ten consecutive trading days. In the event we are unable to comply with such requirement,
we will be removed from the OTCQB marketplace. 

If
we are removed from the OTCQB marketplace, we face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; 

our shares of common stock are currently classified as penny stock which requires brokers trading in our shares of common
stock to adhere to more stringent rules, resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares
of common stock; and 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

Because
we became public by means of a merger, we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms. 

Additional
risks may exist since we became public through a merger with a publicly traded company. Securities analysts of major brokerage firms
may not provide coverage of us since there is little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. No assurance
can be given that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf in the future. 

Compliance
with the reporting requirements of federal securities laws can be expensive. 

We
will become a fully reporting company upon effectiveness of this offering and will be subject to the information and reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws and the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The costs of preparing
and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders are substantial. 

Applicable
regulatory requirements, including those contained in and issued under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, may make it difficult for us to
retain or attract qualified officers and directors, which could adversely affect the management of our business and our ability to obtain
or retain listing of our common stock. 

As
a fully reporting company under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, we may be unable to attract and retain those qualified officers, directors
and members of board committees required to provide for effective management because of the rules and regulations that govern publicly
held companies, including, but not limited to, certifications by principal executive officers. The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
has resulted in the issuance of a series of related rules and regulations and the strengthening of existing rules and regulations by
the SEC, as well as the adoption of new and more stringent rules by the stock exchanges. The perceived increased personal risk associated
with these changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting roles as directors and executive officers. 

Further,
some of these changes heighten the requirements for board or committee membership, particularly with respect to an individual s
independence from the corporation and level of experience in finance and accounting matters. We may have difficulty attracting and retaining
directors with the requisite qualifications. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified officers and directors, the management
of our business and its ability to obtain or retain listing of our shares of common stock on any stock exchange (assuming we elect to
seek and are successful in obtaining such listing) could be adversely affected.

If
we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or detect
fraud. Consequently, investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting and this may decrease the trading price of our stock. 

We
must maintain effective internal controls to provide reliable financial reports and detect fraud. We have been assessing our internal
controls to identify areas that need improvement. Failure to identify and thereafter implement required changes to our internal controls
or any others that we identify as necessary to maintain an effective system of internal controls, if any, could harm our operating results
and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Any such loss of confidence would have a negative effect
on the trading price of our stock. 

The
price of our common stock may become volatile, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation. 

The
trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate in response to factors such as: 

actual
 or anticipated variations in our operating results; 

announcements
 of developments by us or our competitors; 

regulatory
 actions regarding our products; 

announcements
 by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; 

adoption
 of new accounting standards affecting our industry; 

additions
 or departures of key personnel; 

introduction
 of new products by us or our competitors; 

sales
 of our common stock or other securities in the open market; and 

other
 events or factors, many of which are beyond our control such as the continuation of disruptions due to COVID-19. 

The
stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price
of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such a company. Litigation initiated
against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of its management s attention and resources,
which could harm our business and financial condition. 

Our
common stock is controlled by insiders. 

Our
officers and directors beneficially own approximately 70 of our outstanding shares of capital stock through their ownership of Series
B preferred shares. Such concentrated control may adversely affect the price of our common stock. Investors who acquire common stock
may have no effective voice in our management. Sales by our insiders or affiliates along with any other market transactions, could negatively
affect the market price of our common stock. 

Our
President and CEO, Brian Foote, has voting control of the Company s capital stock and, as a result, owners of our common stock
may be unable to influence management and exercise control over our business . 

Our
largest stockholder, Brian Foote, our President and CEO, will control approximately 70 of the voting power of our capital stock principally
through his ownership of Series A and Series B preferred stock. Brian Foote owns 7,000,000 shares of Series A preferred stock which has
the voting power of 1,000 shares of our common stock for each share of Series A preferred stock and 198,421 shares of Series B preferred
stock, each such share having the voting power of 10,000 shares of our common stock. As a result, he is able to: elect or defeat the
election of our directors, amend or prevent amendment to our certificates of incorporation or bylaws, effect or prevent a merger, sale
of assets or other corporate transaction, and control the outcome of any other matter submitted to the stockholders for vote. Accordingly,
other stockholders may be unable to influence management and exercise control over our business.

Our
bylaws include a forum selection clause, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes
with us, remove current management or to be acquired by a third party . 

Our
bylaws require that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, either (i) the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware is to be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting
a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (c) any action
asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or our bylaws or (d) any
action or proceeding asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or (ii) the federal district court in the State of Delaware
will be the exclusive forum for a cause of action arising under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. In addition, our bylaws could
make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or to remove current management through provisions that preclude cumulative voting
in the election of directors and that allow our bylaws to be adopted, amended or repealed by our board of directors. 

This
exclusive forum provision will apply to other state and federal law claims including actions arising under the Securities Act (although
our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder).
Section 22 of the Securities Act, however, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce
any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to
whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act.
Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented
to the foregoing provisions. This forum selection provision in our bylaws may limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable
judicial forum for disputes with us. It is also possible that, notwithstanding the forum selection clause included in our bylaws, a court
could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable. 

We
are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth
companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. 

We
are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or the JOBS Act,
and we intend to take advantage of some of the exemptions from reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that
are not emerging growth companies, including: 

being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements,
with correspondingly reduced Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
disclosure; 

not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; 

not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory
audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial
statements; 

reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and 

not being required to hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute
payments not previously approved. 

Further,
the JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company such as us to take advantage of an extended transition time to comply with
new or revised accounting standards as applicable to public companies. We are choosing to elect the extended transition period for complying
with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected the extended transition period for complying
with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer
an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act.
As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as
of public company effective dates. 

We
cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find
our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may
be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain
an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion
of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large
accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non- affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior
June 30 and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.

If
we do not meet the listing standards of a national securities exchange our investors ability to make transactions in our securities
will be limited, and we will be subject to additional trading restrictions. 

Our
securities currently are traded over-the-counter on the OTCQB and are not qualified to be listed on a national securities exchange, such
as NASDAQ. Accordingly, we face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; 

our shares of common stock are currently classified as penny stock which requires brokers trading in our shares of common
stock to adhere to more stringent rules, resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares
of common stock; 

a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

The
National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the
sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. Since our Common Stock is traded on OTCQB, our
common stock is a covered security. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute
allows the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then
the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. Further, if we were no longer traded over-the-counter,
our common stock would not be a covered security and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. 

Because
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be
your sole source of gain. 

We
have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to
finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying
dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our securities will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. 

Some
provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others,
even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our
current management. 

Provisions
in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party
to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or remove our current management.
These include provisions that: 

permit our Board of Directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as it
may designate, of which we have designated 7,000,000 Series A preferred stock with 1,000 votes per share, all of which are held by Brian
Foote, our CEO; issue 570,000 Series B preferred stock with 10,000 votes per share 400,175 of which are issued and outstanding; 

provide that all vacancies on our Board of Directors, including as a result of newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise
required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum; 

24 

 Table of Contents 

not provide for cumulative voting rights, thereby allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in
any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election; 

provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called by a majority of the Board of Directors; and 

provide that our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal the bylaws. 

These
provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult
for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. Any
provision of our articles of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control
could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the
price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.

Paysen v. HUMBL, LLC, Brian Foote, Jeffrey Hinshaw and George Sharp, Case No.22CV0723 AJB BLM, which is a putative shareholder derivative
class action since November 21, 2020 for alleged violations of the federal securities laws by allegedly making false and misleading statements
regarding our business and operations, more specifically that the HUMBL Pay App did not have the functionality that it promised to investors
and that several international business partnerships had a low chance of contributing material revenues to our bottom line and that we
sold unregistered securities through our BLOCK Exchange Traded Index products, all of which plaintiffs allege caused a decline in the
market value of our shares of common stock. Plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages. We intend to vigorously defend the actions
of the defendants and contest what we believe are baseless claims.

also have been sued in the Delaware Chancery Court in a case styled Mike Armstrong, derivatively on behalf of HUMBL, Inc. v. Brian
Foote, Jeffrey Hinshaw, George Sharp, Michele Rivera, and William B. Hoagland (Case No. 2022-0620) in a class action on behalf of

In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that
are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors,

General 

Our
executive offices are located at 600 B Street, Suite 300, San Diego, California 92101, telephone (786) 738-9012. Our corporate website
address is www.humbl.com . 

Overview 

Following
our merger with HUMBL LLC on December 3, 2020, we changed our name from Tesoro Enterprises, Inc. to HUMBL, Inc. and adopted the business
of HUMBL to deliver a more seamless digital pairing experiences for consumers and merchants in the global economy. This discussion does
not include any operations of our discontinued operations for BLOCK ETX or Tickeri. 

HUMBL
is a Web 3, digital commerce platform that was built to connect consumers, businesses and governments in the digital economy. HUMBL provides
simple tools and packaging for complex new technologies such as blockchain, in the same way that previous cycles of e-commerce and the
cloud were more simply packaged by companies such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Netflix over the past several decades. The Company through
their product offerings are looking to simplify and package the digital economy for consumers, corporations and government. 

The
goal of HUMBL is to provide ready built tools, and platforms for consumers and merchants to seamlessly participate in the digital economy.
HUMBL is built on a patent-pending, decentralized technology stack that utilizes both core and partner technologies, to provide faster
connections to the digital economy and each other. 

The
Company is organized into two divisions: a) HUMBL Consumer and b) HUMBL Commercial. These two divisions incorporate and expand the Company s
core products and services. The majority of the Company s operations prior to 2022 were focused on the Consumer division.

The increase was due in large part to the services rendered from Monster Creative which increased 1,209,781 in 2022 versus 2021. 

Cost
of Revenues and Gross Profit

of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 1,401,658 as compared to 855,805 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase
of 545,853. The increase was primarily due to the direct labor attributable to our production services. Our gross profit grew by 165

expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 42,554,221 as compared to 28,775,951 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase
of 13,778,270. Operating expenses consists of development costs, professional fees and general and administrative expenses and non-cash
charges for impairment expenses and stock-based compensation as fully described below. We expect our development costs and professional
fees to decrease in our next 12 months as we look to scale back on outside contract labor. Approximately 71 of our operating expenses
relate to non-cash charges in 2022 and these charges comprise of over 27,982,000. We do expect that our non-cash charges will be much
lower in the future as our stock-based compensation will be reduced and we have already impaired most of our intangible assets and all
of our goodwill.

Segment
Reporting 

The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 280-10 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information . This standard
requires that companies disclose operating segments based on the manner in which management disaggregates the Company in making operating
decisions. 

For
2021, the Company established three distinct operating segments: HUMBL Marketplace; HUMBL Pay; and HUMBL Financial. Most of the operations
for the year ended December 31, 2021 were conducted in North America. Commencing January 1, 2022, the Company simplified their business
model to segment their business into two distinct divisions: Consumer and Commercial. The 2021 segments were all considered part of the
consumer division. 

Less
than 3-4 of the Company s sales are from outside of North America, therefore the Company has determined that segment reporting
by geographic location was not necessary. In the future, the Company will continue to monitor their activity by region to determine if
it is feasible to report segment information by location.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate
on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable
and accounts payable and capital expenditures. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had 616,950 in cash. Between the revenues generated from our subsidiaries as well as through sales of merchandise,
HUMBL Tickets and NFTs in the HUMBL Marketplace, we continue to fund the development of the HUMBL Wallet. In February 2022 we entered
into a purchase agreement with BizSecure that coincided with the commencement of HUMBL Blockchain Services. With this acquisition of
BizSecure and Ixaya in March 2022, we are growing our operations in the LatAm region of the world and expect to be able to offer our
array of core products to governmental agencies as well as the private sector not in the United States, but throughout the world. We
have generated a majority of our proceeds from the issuance of debt, the sale of common stock and through the exercise of warrants. 

We
had a working capital deficit of 27,408,687 and 20,963,591 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The majority of our current
liabilities is in the form of related party notes. The decrease in working capital is the direct result of these notes as well as the
debt incurred related to the cash necessary to continue the development of our mobile wallet. The Company believes it has adequate capital
resources to meet its cash requirements during the next 12 months as they continue to grow and develop suitable sources of capital. A
majority of the Company s operating expenses in 2022 (71 were the result of non-cash charges such as impairment of intangible
assets including goodwill, settlement and stock-based compensation. The actual monthly cash burn of the Company is approximately 977,000
per month at this time and as our core products come online, this is likely to decrease upon our technology being completed. The Company
has received 1,190,000 in purchases of common stock and warrants, 2,000,000 in additional warrant exercises and 8,700,000 in related
party debt proceeds in 2022, however, as a result of the operating losses and working capital deficit, management has determined that
there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
expect that the consolidation of our platform into HUMBL.com will bring about revenue producing operations to improve the liquidity of
the Company moving forward. However, going forward, the effect of our industry on the capital markets may limit our ability to raise
additional capital on the terms acceptable to us at the time we need it, if at all. The additional post-COVID challenges related to remote
work and travel restrictions that we as a smaller company have faced in striving to meet our disclosure obligations in a timely manner
while taking the steps to protect the health and safety of our employees have impacted, and may continue to further impact, our ability
to raise additional capital. 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over
a reasonable period. The consolidated financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome
of the uncertainties.

The
Company has made strategic acquisitions in the first few months of 2022 to enhance their core products and their intellectual property.
Management believes these acquisitions will result in increased profitability. 

The
Company plans to raise additional capital through the exercising of their warrants as well as through future debt and equity financings
to carry out its business plan. Obtaining additional financing and the successful development of the Company s segments including
their new Blockchain Services group, ultimately, to profitable operations, are necessary for the Company to continue operations. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 11,726,995 and 9,928,322 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 1,798,673
increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of the non-cash charges impacting our net loss from 2021 to
2022, such as the impairment of intangible assets including goodwill and increases in our stock-based compensation. Additionally, we
increased our accounts payable and accrued expenses by 1,933,910 from 2021 to 2022 and had net cash decreases as a result of changes
in our digital assets of 896,284. 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 682,402 for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to purchases of fixed assets of 13,572 and
cash paid, net of amounts received in the acquisition of Ixaya of 148,675, cash paid in the acquisition of BM Authentics of 110,000,
purchases of a non-fungible token of 406,040 and domain names of 275,020 as well as proceeds received from the sale of fixed assets
of 270,905. In the year ended December 31, 2021 we incurred investing activities of 237,182 related to 367,576 for purchases of fixed
assets, 127,377 in cash received in the acquisition of Tickeri, and 3,017 in cash received in the acquisition of Monster Creative. 

Cash
provided by financing activities was 9,853,244 and 11,617,628 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash was
provided through proceeds from sales of membership interests in HUMBL LLC in 2021 of 10,000, proceeds from the issuance of common stock
for cash for 1,000,000, proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes of 6,700,000, and repayment of notes payable of 51,600. In
2022, the Company raised 2,000,000 from the exercise of warrants and proceeds from related party notes in the amount of 8,700,000,
and a contribution of capital of 406,040 (as well as non-cash contribution of capital of 500,000) by the Company s CEO as well
as repayments of notes payable, related party notes, amounts due to seller and bank loans of 2,600,296 and the purchase of treasury
shares of 50,000 that was subsequently retired. 

Since
the date of the reverse merger in December 2020 we have financed our operations through sales of common and preferred stock and the issuance
of debt.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include, but are not limited to, management s estimate
of provisions required for permanent and temporary differences related to income taxes, liabilities to accrue, estimates of the fair value
of goodwill and determination of the fair value of stock awards. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Safeguarding Obligation 

Assets related to user cryptocurrencies safeguarding
obligation and the user cryptocurrencies safeguarding obligation represent the Company s obligation to safeguard customers 
crypto assets in digital wallets on the Company s platform. The Company safeguards these assets for customers and is obligated to
safeguard them from loss, theft, or other misuse. The Company recognizes the users cryptocurrencies liabilities and corresponding assets
related to the users cryptocurrencies, on initial recognition and at each reporting date, at fair value of the crypto assets. Any loss,
theft, or misuse would impact the measurement of users crypto assets. 

The majority of the cryptocurrency obligation is comprised
of Bitcoin, Ethereum and BLOCKS. 

Inventory 

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable
value, with cost determined using the first-in first-out method. The carrying value of inventory is evaluated periodically for excess
quantities and obsolescence. Management evaluates quantities on hand and physical condition as these characteristics may be impacted by
anticipated customer demand for current products. The allowance is adjusted based on such evaluation, with a corresponding provision included
in cost of sales. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

ASC 825 Financial Instruments requires the Company
to disclose estimated fair values for its financial instruments. Fair value estimates, methods, and assumptions are set forth below for
the Company s financial instruments: The carrying amount of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid and other current assets, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities, and amounts payable to related parties, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of
those instruments. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments. 

Digital
Assets 

Digital assets,
including non-fungible tokens and cryptocurrencies, are included in the consolidated balance sheets. We have ownership of and control
over our digital assets and may use third party custodial services to secure them. Digital assets are initially recorded at cost and are
subsequently remeasured at cost, net of any impairment losses on our consolidated balance sheets. We assign costs to digital asset transactions
on a first-in, first-out basis. Gains or losses are not recorded until realized upon sale(s). 

We determine the fair value of our digital assets
on a nonrecurring basis, based on quoted prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal market for such assets
(Level 1 inputs). We perform a quarterly, or more frequent review to identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally
decreases in the quoted prices on active exchanges on any day during the quarter, indicate that it is more likely than not that our digital
assets are impaired.

 Table of Contents 

The cost basis of digital assets will not be adjusted
upward for subsequent increases in fair value. Such impairment in the value of digital assets is recorded as a component of other operating
expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. We recorded an impairment loss of approximately 1,606,784 and 34,570 related
to digital assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which 258,217 in 2022 relates to the NFT we purchased. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer
that is within the scope of this Topic only when the five steps of revenue recognition under ASC 606 are met. 

The five core principles will be evaluated for each
service provided by the Company and is further supported by applicable guidance in ASC 606 to support the Company s recognition
of revenue. 

The Company accounts for revenues based on the verticals
in which they were earned. The three principal verticals in which the Company operates today are HUMBL Mobile Wallet, HUMBL Marketplace,
and HUMBL Blockchain Services. 

HUMBL Mobile Wallet (formerly HUMBL Pay) 

The Company is anticipated to earn transaction revenues
primarily from fees charged to consumers and merchants on a transaction basis through the Company s mobile application. These fees
may have a fixed and/or variable component. The variable component is generally a percentage of the value of the payment amount and is
known at the time the transaction is processed. For a portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement
when the underlying transaction is approved for a refund. The Company may estimate the amount of fee refunds that will be processed each
quarter and record a provision against the net revenues. The volume of activity processed on the platform, which results in transaction
revenue, is referred to as Total Payment Volume TPV ). 

The Company will earn additional fees on transactions
where currency conversion is performed via on ramping and off ramping via digital currencies, when swaps are performed on digital currencies,
and when cross-border transactions are enabled (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate
the instant transfer of funds for customers from their HUMBL account to their debit card or bank account, and other miscellaneous fees.
The Company will rely on third party partners to perform all money transmission services. 

The Company may earn revenues from other value-added
services, which are comprised primarily of revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, ticketing,
peer-to-peer payments, and other services that will be provided to merchants and consumers. These contracts typically have one performance
obligation which is provided and recognized over the term of the contract. 

The transaction price is generally fixed and known
at the end of each reporting period; however, for some agreements, it may be necessary to estimate the transaction price using the expected
value method. The Company is expected to record revenue earned in revenues from other value-added services on a net basis when they are
considered the agent with respect to processing transactions. 

33 

 Table of Contents 

HUMBL Search Engine 

Revenues are derived principally from the sale of
advertisements, classifieds fees, and revenue sharing arrangements. Advertising revenue is derived principally from the sale of online
advertisements which are based on impressions (i.e., the number of times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by
users of our platforms) or clicks (which are generated each time users on our platforms click through our advertisements
to an advertiser s designated website) delivered to advertisers. 

The Company uses the output method and apply the practical
expedient to recognize advertising revenue in the amount to which they have a right to invoice. For contracts with target advertising
commitments with rebates, estimated payout is accounted for as a variable consideration to the extent it is probable that a significant
reversal of revenue will not occur. 

HUMBL Tickets 

The Company recognizes revenues from HUMBL Tickets
primarily from service fees. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount
that reflects the consideration we receive in exchange for those goods or services. For service fees and payment processing fees, revenue
is recognized when the ticket is sold. 

We evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize
revenue on a gross or net basis based upon our evaluation of whether we obtain control of the specified goods or services by considering
if we are primarily responsible for fulfillment of the promise, have inventory risk, and have the latitude in establishing pricing and
selecting suppliers, among other factors. 

For the payment processing service, we determined
that we are the principal in providing the service as we responsible for fulfilling the promise to process the payment and we have discretion
and latitude in establishing the price of our service. Based on our assessment, we record revenue on a net basis related to our ticketing
service and on a gross basis related to our payment processing service. As a result, costs incurred for processing the transactions are
included in cost of net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. 

Revenue is presented net of indirect taxes, value-added
taxes, creator royalties and reserves for customer refunds, payment chargebacks and estimated uncollectible amounts. If an event is cancelled
by a creator, then any obligations to provide refunds to event attendees are the responsibility of that creator. 

If a creator is unwilling or unable to fulfill their
refund obligations, we may, at our discretion, provide attendee refunds. Revenue is also presented net of the amortization of creator
signing fees when applicable. The benefit we receive by securing exclusive ticketing and payment processing rights with certain creators
from creator signing fees is inseparable from the customer relationship with the creator and accordingly these fees are recorded as a
reduction of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. 

HUMBL Marketplace 

The Company recognizes revenue when they transfer
control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which is expected to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected, which are subsequently remitted to governmental
authorities. 

Net transaction revenues 

The net transaction revenues will primarily include
final value fees, feature fees, including fees to promote listings, and listing fees from sellers in our Marketplace. The net transaction
revenues will also include store subscription and other fees often from large enterprise sellers. The net transaction revenues are reduced
by incentives provided to customers. 

34 

 Table of Contents 

The Company has identified one performance obligation
to sellers on the Marketplace platform, which is to connect buyers and sellers on the secure and trusted Marketplace platforms. Final
value fees are recognized when an item is sold on a Marketplace platform, satisfying this performance obligation. There may be additional
services available to Marketplace sellers, mainly to promote or feature listings, that are not distinct within the context of the contract. 

Accordingly, fees for these additional services are
recognized when the single performance obligation is satisfied. Promoted listing fees are recognized when the item is sold and feature
and listing fees are recognized when an item is sold, or when the contract expires. 

Further, to drive traffic to the platform, the Company
will provide incentives to buyers and sellers in various forms including discounts on fees, discounts on items sold, coupons and rewards.
Evaluating whether a promotion or incentive is a payment to a customer may require significant judgment. Promotions and incentives which
are consideration payable to a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the later of when revenue is recognized or when the
incentive is paid or promise to be paid. Promotions and incentives to most buyers on our Marketplace platforms, to whom there is no performance
obligation, are recognized as sales and marketing expense. In addition, there may be credits provided to customers when certain fees are
refunded. Credits are accounted for as variable consideration at contract inception when estimating the amount of revenue to be recognized
when a performance obligation is satisfied to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur and
updated as additional information becomes available. 

HUMBL Blockchain Services 

The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with
customers into product revenues and services revenues. 

Product revenue related contracts with customers begin
upon contract inception when a purchase order for a specific customer order of a product to be delivered in the near term. These purchase
orders are short-term in nature. Product revenue is recognized at a point in time upon shipment or upon customer receipt of the product,
depending on shipping terms. The Company determined that this method best represents the transfer of goods as transfer of control typically
occurs upon shipment or upon customer receipt of the product. 

Service revenues primarily consist of revenues derived
from maintenance support and the use of the Company s service platforms and application programming interface APIs on a subscription basis. The Company generates this revenue from fees for maintenance and support, monthly active user fees, SaaS fees,
and hosting and storage fees. In most cases, the subscription or transaction arrangement is a single performance obligation comprised
of a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer (i.e., distinct days of service).
The Company applies a time-based measure of progress to the total transaction price, which results in ratable recognition over the term
of the contract. The Company determined that this method best represents the transfer of services as the customer obtains equal benefit
from the service throughout the service period. 

The Company accounts for individual goods and services
separately if they are distinct performance obligations, which often requires significant judgment based upon knowledge of the products
and/or services, the solution provided and the structure of the sales contract. In SaaS agreements, the Company provides a service to
the customer that combines the software functionality, maintenance and hosting into a single performance obligation. In product-related
contracts, a purchase order may cover different products, each constituting a separate performance obligation. 

Impact of Cryptocurrency Bankruptcies 

In November 2022, both FTX Trading and BlockFi filed
for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. These bankruptcies have impacted several companies either directly or indirectly. Customers
of the HUMBL Pay app use our platform to hold their cryptocurrency. Assets related to user cryptocurrencies safeguarding obligation and
the user cryptocurrencies safeguarding obligation represent the Company s obligation to safeguard customers crypto assets
in digital wallets on the Company s platform. The Company safeguards these assets for customers and is obligated to safeguard them
from loss, theft, or other misuse. The Company recognizes the users cryptocurrencies liabilities and corresponding assets related to the
users cryptocurrencies, on initial recognition and at each reporting date, at fair value of the crypto assets. Any loss, theft, or misuse
would impact the measurement of users crypto assets. 

The majority of the cryptocurrency obligation is comprised
of Bitcoin, Ethereum and BLOCKS. 

We do not, nor have we ever used either of these exchanges
to conduct business. We have not been impacted by these bankruptcies. And we continue to monitor the industry and protect our customers 
assets.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the shareholders and the board of directors of HUMBL, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HUMBL, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of
operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In
addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IN US 

 DECEMBER
31, 2022 AND 2021 

of their membership interests for shares of newly created Series B Preferred
Stock. The Series B Preferred shares were issued to the respective members of HUMBL LLC following the approval by FINRA of a of the common shares and the increase in the authorized common shares to shares, and preferred
shares. 

The

control of the Company, the former CEO, Henry Boucher assigned his shares of Series A Preferred Stock as well as 
shares of common stock to Brian Foote, the President and CEO of HUMBL LLC for a note payable. After the reverse merger was completed,
HUMBL LLC ceased doing business, and all operations were conducted under Tesoro Enterprises, Inc. which later changed its name to HUMBL,
Inc. HUMBL or the Company ). 

On
June 3, 2021 we acquired Tickeri, Inc. Tickeri in a debt and stock transaction totaling following which Tickeri
became a subsidiary of HUMBL. Tickeri is a leading ticketing, live events and box office SaaS platform featuring Latin events and artists
throughout the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean corridor. The purchase price for the stock purchase was payable
through the issuance of in our common stock and payable through the issuance of two promissory notes. The shares
had a deemed value equal to the volume weighted average price per share of HUMBL common stock on the OTC Markets for the ten consecutive
trading days ending with the complete trading day ending two trading days prior to the closing. We issued the two shareholders of Tickeri,
Juan Gonzalez and Javier Gonzalez, shares of our common stock each. We also issued to each of Juan and Javier Gonzalez a secured

of the Settlement Agreement, the Notes were cancelled, and the parties agreed to a mutual release of claims. As a result of this settlement,
the Company has reclassified the assets, and liabilities of Tickeri as held for sale, and the operations as discontinued operations as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

On
June 30, 2021, we acquired Monster Creative, LLC Monster ). Monster is a Hollywood production studio that specializes in
producing movie trailers and other related content. Monster was founded by Doug Brandt and Kevin Childress. Monster will collaborate
with HUMBL in the production of NFTs and other digital content. The purchase price for all of the membership interests in Monster was
paid through the issuance of one convertible note and one non-convertible note to each of Doug Brandt and Kevin Childress in the aggregate
principal amount of . The convertible notes were issued to Doug Brandt (through an entity owned by him) and Kevin Childress
in the aggregate principal amount of . The notes convert at the holder s election, bear interest at per annum and

30, 2022 of the notes that were due April 1, 2022 until July 1, 2022 and then another extension on July 1, 2022 to October 1, 2022. These
notes are currently in default. 

In
the initial extension agreements through July 1, 2022, the Company added 
 to the Phantom Power note and 
 to the Kevin Childress note, and then added another
 
 to the Phantom Power Note and 
 to the Kevin Childress note on July 1, 2022 to
extend these notes to October 1, 2022. .
The Company has not yet made the payment that was due October 1, 2022 and is in default under the notes. 

On
February 12, 2022, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with BizSecure, Inc. BizSecure ). The Company determined
this was an acquisition of a business pursuant to the guidance provided in both ASC 805 and Rule 11-01(d) of Regulation S-X. BizSecure
is not considered a significant subsidiary under Regulation S-X Rule 1-02(w). The Company acquired a customer relationship with the US
Air Force and BizSecure s Mobile ID technology. The Company entered into employment agreements with two BizSecure employees as
part of the agreement to help integrate the Mobile ID technology into the Company s larger suite of products and help operate the
blockchain services division. The assets acquired from BizSecure represented the majority of the operations of the entity and BizSecure
post-acquisition has only conducted nominal operations and has no employees. The Company issued to BizSecure common shares
and restricted stock units RSUs that vest quarterly commencing April 1, 2022 for a period of . The
shares and restricted stock units have a value of . The Company has included the value of which represents the value
of the restricted stock units in contingent consideration pursuant to ASC 805-10-55-25. Management considered several factors when making
the determination to treat the RSUs as contingent consideration and not post-combination compensation, including, but not limited to,
the following: (a) the RSUs are not automatically forfeited upon termination of the two key employees as those RSUs would vest if the
employees were terminated without cause or if the employees resigned with good reasons; (b) all selling shareholders of BizSecure receive
the same pro rata compensation; (c) the BizSecure shareholders hired by the Company receive compensation commensurate with other employees
in the Company at the same level; (d) there are no adjustments to the RSUs based on earnings and thus there is no profit-sharing component
to the RSUs; and (e) the parties desired for the compensation to be paid over time and not all up front. Therefore, the Company determined
that the restricted stock units should be treated as contingent consideration. On December 30, 2022, as a result of the Company s
failure to timely register the shares of common stock issued February 12, 2022 BizSecure requested the cancellation of such
shares and the RSUs that vested during 2022. Pursuant to BizSecure s request, the shares of common stock
and the RSUs were rescinded effective December 30, 2022. The remaining RSUs will continue to vest in accordance
with the original terms. There is no requirement for the Company to cease using the intellectual property received in the February 12,
2022 transaction.

HUMBL
is a Web 3, digital commerce platform that was built to connect consumers, businesses and governments in the digital economy. HUMBL provides
simple tools and packaging for complex new technologies such as blockchain, in the same way that previous cycles of e-commerce and the
cloud were more simply packaged by companies such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Netflix over the past several decades. The Company through
their product offerings are looking to simplify and package the digital economy for consumers, corporations and government. 

The
goal of HUMBL is to provide ready built tools, and platforms for consumers and merchants to seamlessly participate in the digital economy.
HUMBL is built on a patent-pending, decentralized technology stack that utilizes both core and partner technologies, to provide faster
connections to the digital economy and each other. 

The
Company is organized into two divisions: a) HUMBL Consumer and b) HUMBL Commercial. These two divisions incorporate and expand the Company s
core products and services. The majority of the Company s operations prior to 2022 were focused on the Consumer division. 

HUMBL
 A Web 3 Commerce Platform 

HUMBL
was founded to deliver an integrated, Web 3 digital commerce platform for consumers, merchants and governments. HUMBL has delivered one
of the first integrated technology environments in which a digital wallet, search engine, social media and marketplace listings can be
used together by consumers in one place. The HUMBL platform is comprised of the following key components described below.

HUMBL
Wallet 

The
HUMBL Wallet is the centerpiece of the Web 3 consumer experience on the HUMBL platform. The HUMBL Wallet is self-custodied by the individual;
ensuring that they have full control over their digital assets and private keys. 

Customers
can use the HUMBL Wallet to send and receive digital assets, interact on the HUMBL Social platform, perform web searches on the HUMBL
Search Engine, store and manage their NFTs, consume content via MP4 multimedia player and more. 

The
HUMBL Wallet drives revenue through: a) digital asset swaps, in which the customer can use the self-custodied HUMBL digital wallet to
swap from one digital asset to another on the Ethereum blockchain, and b) purchasing crypto through Sardine, a third-party service that
allows customers to buy digital assets with credit cards. 

The
HUMBL Wallet is also connected to the BLOCKS Registry, a decentralized blockchain registry that allows customers to authenticate digital
items, such as NFTs, and track the chain of custody to ensure reduced fraud, forgery and theft in the digital markets. 

HUMBL
Wallet customers have the obligation to perform their own tax record keeping and tracking of assets and swaps in the self-custodied wallet;
as well as backup of their private keys, to ensure the recoverability, data security and storage of their digital assets. 

The
HUMBL Wallet is equipped with 2-factor authentication; as well as biometric security features, which are handled by the handset and its
manufacturer. HUMBL does not store or have access to any biometric information related to its verified users. 

The
HUMBL Wallet uses SumSub, a third-party service provider, to perform KYC / KYB and authenticate customers. HUMBL does not capture or
store consumers information on HUMBL s servers, except for their corresponding name, wallet address and email address for
basic communications with the verified user. HUMBL does not resell its customers data. 

The
HUMBL Wallet is available in over 130 countries and is not available in any OFAC Countries. 

HUMBL
Search Engine 

The
HUMBL Search Engine is available via the HUMBL Wallet and the HUMBL website. The HUMBL Search Engine allows customers to search for standard
Web 2 content such as news, images and video search capabilities. The company also recently completed the development of its HUMBL Ads
portal, which can be used to customize advertising programs for clients. This includes traditional search advertising such as display
ads, location targeting and cost-per-click performance advertising. 

The
HUMBL Search Engine also offers Web 3 blockchain-based search features such as the ability to search major NFTs across Ethereum, Polygon,
BLOCKS, Gnosis and Solana. Consumers are able to confirm that certain NFTs have been Verified by BLOCKS to protect against
the fraud and forgery in the NFT market. The search engine also shows customers where certain NFTs are available for purchase across
various marketplaces. 

HUMBL
Tickets 

HUMBL
Tickets is initially focused on the offering of secondary (resale) tickets to thousands of live events across North America. HUMBL Tickets
inventory listings and ticket fulfillment are provided by Ticket Evolution and HUMBL earns a commission for each sale through its website. 

The
ticketing content provided on HUMBL Tickets spans across major live music, sports, festivals and events in multiple countries. HUMBL
Tickets advertises its services primarily across social media, including its own HUMBL Social platform. 

HUMBL
is also exploring the development of primary ticketing and peer-to-peer ticketing sales via blockchain technology and dynamic QR codes,
with ticket storage inside the HUMBL Wallet as future digital collectibles; along with authenticated content, ratings and reviews from
ticketed events on the HUMBL Social platform via verified profiles, commemorative icons and attendance badges. 

HUMBL
Marketplace 

The
HUMBL Marketplace was designed to pair authenticated buyers and sellers in verified, digital commerce. The HUMBL Marketplace currently
works with clients such as professional athletes, brands, and marketing and talent agencies, to provide sports merchandise ranging from
autographed jerseys, bats, balls, helmets, photos and more. 

The
HUMBL Marketplace mitigates forgeries by pairing physical merchandise with digital certificates of registration. Merchandise is made
available on the HUMBL platform and is verified, registered, and cataloged on the blockchain. 

The
HUMBL Marketplace also allows for the minting and listing of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as digital collectibles, that allow pre-approved
individuals to monetize their digital images, multimedia content and catalogues on the blockchain. 

HUMBL
is a software platform and does not act as a broker, financial institution, or creditor for digital collectibles. We facilitate transactions
between the buyer and seller in the auction/sale process, but we are not a party to any agreement between the buyer and seller or between
any users. 

HUMBL
Social 

HUMBL
Social is one of the world s first user-verified social media platforms. The social media platform is available via web browser
and the HUMBL Wallet. The goal of HUMBL Social is to provide real people, real profiles and real merchants with a place to connect on
the worldwide web. 

HUMBL
Social supports only verified user profiles, to ensure authenticity of the platform. This helps to reduce the fake profiles, product
ratings and reviews that have plagued major Web 2 social media platforms due to the allowance of anonymous profiles and non-verified
sellers. The HUMBL Social platform is available in over 130+ countries via the HUMBL Wallet and web browser. 

HUMBL
Metaverse Stores 

HUMBL
has created technology to build customized metaverse stores for brands, athletes, entertainers and celebrities. HUMBL s first metaverse
store was created for Major League Baseball player Ke Bryan Hayes and his father Charlie Hayes, a retired Major League Baseball
player. The brand metaverse store is called the House of Hayes and supports the development of an immersive player experience,
in which customers can navigate a simulated environment of historical artwork and current digital collectibles. Custom artwork was provided
by Topps Sports Artist of the Year Lauren Taylor, in the form of digital collectibles that rotated on screens throughout
the environment. Endorsement sporting goods brands of Ke Bryan Hayes, such as Wilson, Franklin and Old Hickory, also supported
product placement and sell-through environments for products such as authentic baseball bats and gloves. An immersive Wilson Amphitheatre
was also created for multimedia press conferences or media interactions with Ke Bryan Hayes avatar. 

HUMBL
Blockchain Services 

HUMBL
Blockchain Services HBS was formed as part of the Company s asset acquisition of BizSecure on February 12, 2022.
Recognizing the opportunities for governments and commercial enterprises to incorporate blockchain and distributed ledger technologies DLT ), HBS is focused on working with clients to identify problems and develop solutions that build upon the various capabilities
the Company has and continues to develop. 

Our
solutions enable municipalities, government agencies, and other commercial entities the ability to offer mobile IDs and other credential
verification services to their constituents. We continue to make significant investments to leverage our existing technologies and further
expand our DLT capabilities. 

Components
of the HUMBL Wallet can be used by HBS to white label a Powered By environment for local, state or national government
clients that may want to move to digital or blockchain-based registry formats of their transactions, record keeping and / or payments
from citizens, corporations, or government departments. 

An
example of this is a pilot program that HUMBL is currently developing with the County of Santa Cruz (CA), in which HUMBL and the County
are working to scope the development of a digital wallet in which citizens can more easily and effectively receive government services
access via digital technologies. 

HUMBL
Financial 

HUMBL
Financial was developed to package step-function technologies such as blockchain into several clicks for the customer. 

In
2021, HUMBL Financial created BLOCK ETX products to simplify digital asset investing for customers and institutions seeking exposure
to a new, 24/7 digital asset class. We have launched this product in 100 countries outside the United States. HUMBL Financial has developed
proprietary, multi-factor blockchain indexes, trading algorithms and financial services for the new digital asset trading markets to
accommodate index, active and thematic investment strategies. BLOCK ETXs are completely non-custodial, algorithmically driven software
services that allow customers to purchase and hold digital assets in pre-set allocations through their own digital asset exchange accounts.
BLOCK ETXs are compatible for United States customers who have accounts with Coinbase Pro, Bittrex US or Binance US and for non-US customers
who have accounts with Bittrex Global. BLOCK ETXs were served first on the desktop and web version of the HUMBL platform, with the goal
of future applications inside the HUMBL mobile application. HUMBL Financial is open to the licensing of the BLOCK ETXs to institutions
and exchanges. HUMBL Financial also plans to offer trusted, third-party financial services in areas such as payments, investments, credit
card services and lending across the HUMBL platform over time. 

In
February 2022, the Company elected to suspend offering the BLOCK ETX products pending further legal analysis regarding how to offer the
BLOCK ETXs in a fully compliant manner with the evolving laws and regulatory treatment of such novel products. The Company will continue
to monitor the regulatory environment with respect to these products. In accordance with ASC 205-20-50-1(a), the timing of the disposal
was February 28, 2022. The Company met the criteria for the BLOCK ETX operations to be classified as held for sale at that time. 

Going
Concern 

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate
on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable
and accounts payable and capital expenditures. 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we devoted a substantial amount of capital to build out our platform and as a result our
working capital deficit and accumulated deficit have increased significantly. In addition, we have incurred significant debt from both
unrelated and related parties to assist in supporting our operations. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had in cash. During the last two years we have built our platform and grew our operations by acquiring companies to support what we have just recently consolidated into HUMBL.com. The acquisitions increased our debt and our common shares issued as we spent very little cash in these acquisitions. The impact of COVID-19, supply chain issues, challenges in the cryptocurrency market and recent bank failures have had a very minimal impact on the Company s operations. 

We
had a working capital deficit of and as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The majority of our current
liabilities is in the form of related party notes. The decrease in working capital is the direct result of these notes as well as the
debt incurred related to the cash necessary to continue the development of our mobile wallet. A
majority of the Company s operating expenses in 2022 were the result of non-cash charges such as impairment of intangible
assets including goodwill, settlement and stock-based compensation. The actual monthly cash burn of the Company is approximately 
per month at this time and as our core products come online, this is likely to decrease upon our technology being completed. The Company
has received in purchases of common stock and warrants, in additional warrant exercises and in related
party debt proceeds in 2022, however, as a result of the operating losses and working capital deficit, management has determined that
there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
expect that the consolidation of our platform into HUMBL.com will bring about revenue producing operations to improve the liquidity of
the Company moving forward. However, going forward, the effect of our industry on the capital markets may limit our ability to raise
additional capital on the terms acceptable to us at the time we need it, if at all. The additional post-COVID challenges related to remote
work and travel restrictions that we as a smaller company have faced in striving to meet our disclosure obligations in a timely manner
while taking the steps to protect the health and safety of our employees have impacted, and may continue to further impact, our ability
to raise additional capital. 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over
a reasonable period. The consolidated financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome
of the uncertainties. 

Impact
of COVID-19 

The
COVID-19 pandemic previously had a profound effect on the U.S. and global economy and may continue to affect the economy and the industries
in which we operate, depending on the vaccine rollouts and the emergence of virus mutations. 

COVID-19
did not have a material effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations or the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Our
ability to access the capital markets and maintain existing operations is unknown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Any such limitation on
available financing and how we conduct business with our customers and vendors would adversely affect our business. 

Because
the federal government and some state and local authorities are reacting to the many variants of COVID-19, it is creating uncertainty
on whether these actions could disrupt the operation of the Company s business and have an adverse effect on the Company. The extent
to which the COVID-19 outbreak may impact the Company s results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and
cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact. 

Impact
of Cryptocurrency Bankruptcies 

In
November 2022, both FTX Trading and BlockFi filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. These bankruptcies have impacted several
companies either directly or indirectly. Customers of the HUMBL Pay app use our platform to hold their cryptocurrency. Assets related
to user cryptocurrencies safeguarding obligation and the user cryptocurrencies safeguarding obligation represent the Company s
obligation to safeguard customers crypto assets in digital wallets on the Company s platform. The Company safeguards these
assets for customers and is obligated to safeguard them from loss, theft, or other misuse. The Company recognizes the users cryptocurrencies
liabilities and corresponding assets related to the users cryptocurrencies, on initial recognition and at each reporting date, at fair
value of the crypto assets. Any loss, theft, or misuse would impact the measurement of users crypto assets. 

The
majority of the cryptocurrency obligation is comprised of Bitcoin, Ethereum and BLOCKS. 

We
do not, nor have we ever used either of these exchanges to conduct business. We have not been impacted by these bankruptcies. And we
continue to monitor the industry and protect our customers assets. 

of Monster, Ixaya and BM Authentics. The Company formed additional
subsidiaries that are inactive and have no activity for future use. All operations of Tickeri are reflected in discontinued operations
as this entity was sold back to the original owners on January 31, 2023, however as of December 31, 2022 this transaction was approved
by the Company s Board of Directors and being negotiated. 

The
Company applies the guidance of Topic 805 Business Combinations of the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC ). 

For
Monster, BizSecure, Ixaya and BM Authentics, the Company accounted for these acquisitions as business combinations and the difference
between the consideration paid and the net assets was applied to goodwill as there were no identifiable intangible assets acquired. 

cash equivalents as of December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company maintains cash balances in excess of the FDIC insured limit at a single bank. 

In
2022, the Company established a service to their HUMBL Pay app users. The service enables HUMBL Pay app users the ability through a Company
maintained digital asset wallet with Wyre Wyre to purchase digital assets (cryptocurrency). As it can take 5 to 8 business
days to physically settle funds in the Wyre wallet, there may be delays in digital assets being received by customers and the delivery
of BLOCKS in a BitGo wallet BitGo ). BitGo is a third-party custodian service that provides the custody for the customers 
BLOCKS. 

The
BitGo account is not the Company s account; however it represents the pool of all BLOCKS held by and allocated to HUMBL Pay users
accounts. The users may choose to transfer the purchased BLOCKS to their individual wallets outside of HUMBL. 

Fixed
assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets
with infinite lives, such as digital currency are valued at costs and reviewed for indicators of impairment at least annually, or more
depending on circumstances. 

The
Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers to be important which could trigger an impairment review include the following:

Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; 

2.
Significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; and 

3.
Significant negative industry or economic trends. 

When
the Company determines that the carrying value of intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above
indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows, the Company
records an impairment charge. The Company measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate
determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model. Significant management judgment is
required in determining whether an indicator of impairment exists and in projecting cash flows. 

The
transaction price is generally fixed and known at the end of each reporting period; however, for some agreements, it may be necessary
to estimate the transaction price using the expected value method. The Company is expected to record revenue earned in revenues from
other value-added services on a net basis when they are considered the agent with respect to processing transactions. 

HUMBL
Search Engine 

Revenues
are derived principally from the sale of advertisements, classifieds fees, and revenue sharing arrangements. Advertising revenue is derived
principally from the sale of online advertisements which are based on impressions (i.e., the number of times that an advertisement
appears in pages viewed by users of our platforms) or clicks (which are generated each time users on our platforms click
through our advertisements to an advertiser s designated website) delivered to advertisers. 

The
Company uses the output method and apply the practical expedient to recognize advertising revenue in the amount to which they have a
right to invoice. For contracts with target advertising commitments with rebates, estimated payout is accounted for as a variable consideration
to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. 

HUMBL
Tickets 

The
Company recognizes revenues from HUMBL Tickets primarily from service fees. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods
or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we receive in exchange for those goods or services.
For service fees and payment processing fees, revenue is recognized when the ticket is sold. 

We
evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon our evaluation of whether we obtain control
of the specified goods or services by considering if we are primarily responsible for fulfillment of the promise, have inventory risk,
and have the latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers, among other factors. 

For
the payment processing service, we determined that we are the principal in providing the service as we responsible for fulfilling the
promise to process the payment and we have discretion and latitude in establishing the price of our service. Based on our assessment,
we record revenue on a net basis related to our ticketing service and on a gross basis related to our payment processing service. As
a result, costs incurred for processing the transactions are included in cost of net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. 

Revenue
is presented net of indirect taxes, value-added taxes, creator royalties and reserves for customer refunds, payment chargebacks and estimated
uncollectible amounts. If an event is cancelled by a creator, then any obligations to provide refunds to event attendees are the responsibility
of that creator. 

If
a creator is unwilling or unable to fulfill their refund obligations, we may, at our discretion, provide attendee refunds. Revenue is
also presented net of the amortization of creator signing fees when applicable. The benefit we receive by securing exclusive ticketing
and payment processing rights with certain creators from creator signing fees is inseparable from the customer relationship with the
creator and accordingly these fees are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. 

HUMBL
Marketplace 

The
Company recognizes revenue when they transfer control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which is expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected, which
are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. 

Net
transaction revenues 

The
net transaction revenues will primarily include final value fees, feature fees, including fees to promote listings, and listing fees
from sellers in our Marketplace. The net transaction revenues will also include store subscription and other fees often from large enterprise
sellers. The net transaction revenues are reduced by incentives provided to customers. 

The
Company has identified one performance obligation to sellers on the Marketplace platform, which is to connect buyers and sellers on the
secure and trusted Marketplace platforms. Final value fees are recognized when an item is sold on a Marketplace platform, satisfying
this performance obligation. There may be additional services available to Marketplace sellers, mainly to promote or feature listings,
that are not distinct within the context of the contract. 

Accordingly,
fees for these additional services are recognized when the single performance obligation is satisfied. Promoted listing fees are recognized
when the item is sold and feature and listing fees are recognized when an item is sold, or when the contract expires. 

Further,
to drive traffic to the platform, the Company will provide incentives to buyers and sellers in various forms including discounts on fees,
discounts on items sold, coupons and rewards. Evaluating whether a promotion or incentive is a payment to a customer may require significant
judgment. Promotions and incentives which are consideration payable to a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the later
of when revenue is recognized or when the incentive is paid or promise to be paid. Promotions and incentives to most buyers on our Marketplace
platforms, to whom there is no performance obligation, are recognized as sales and marketing expense. In addition, there may be credits
provided to customers when certain fees are refunded. Credits are accounted for as variable consideration at contract inception when
estimating the amount of revenue to be recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied to the extent that it is probable that a
significant reversal of revenue will not occur and updated as additional information becomes available. 

HUMBL
Blockchain Services 

The
Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers into product revenues and services revenues. 

Product
revenue related contracts with customers begin upon contract inception when a purchase order for a specific customer order of a product
to be delivered in the near term. These purchase orders are short-term in nature. Product revenue is recognized at a point in time upon
shipment or upon customer receipt of the product, depending on shipping terms. The Company determined that this method best represents
the transfer of goods as transfer of control typically occurs upon shipment or upon customer receipt of the product. 

Service
revenues primarily consist of revenues derived from maintenance support and the use of the Company s service platforms and application
programming interface APIs on a subscription basis. The Company generates this revenue from fees for maintenance and
support, monthly active user fees, SaaS fees, and hosting and storage fees. In most cases, the subscription or transaction arrangement
is a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and that have the same
pattern of transfer (i.e., distinct days of service). The Company applies a time-based measure of progress to the total transaction price,
which results in ratable recognition over the term of the contract. The Company determined that this method best represents the transfer
of services as the customer obtains equal benefit from the service throughout the service period. 

The
Company accounts for individual goods and services separately if they are distinct performance obligations, which often requires significant
judgment based upon knowledge of the products and/or services, the solution provided and the structure of the sales contract. In SaaS
agreements, the Company provides a service to the customer that combines the software functionality, maintenance and hosting into a single
performance obligation. In product-related contracts, a purchase order may cover different products, each constituting a separate performance
obligation. 

In
February 2022, the Company elected to suspend offering the BLOCK ETX products pending further legal analysis regarding how to offer the
BLOCK ETXs in a fully compliant manner with the evolving laws and regulatory treatment of such novel products. The Company will continue

For
2021, the Company established three distinct operating segments: HUMBL Marketplace; HUMBL Pay; and HUMBL Financial. Most of the operations
for the year ended December 31, 2021 were conducted in North America. Commencing January 1, 2022, the Company simplified their business
model to segment their business into two distinct divisions: Consumer and Commercial. The 2021 segments were all considered part of the
consumer division. 

All
of the Company s sales are from North America, therefore the Company has determined that segment reporting by geographic location
was not necessary. In the future, the Company will continue to monitor their activity by region to determine if it is feasible to report
segment information by location.

Air Force and BizSecure s Mobile ID technology. The Company entered into employment agreements with two BizSecure employees as
part of the agreement to help integrate the Mobile ID technology into the Company s larger suite of products and help operate the
blockchain services division. The assets acquired from BizSecure represented the majority of the operations of the entity and BizSecure

stock units have a value of . The Company has included the value of which represents the value of the restricted
stock units in contingent consideration pursuant to ASC 805-10-55-25. Management considered several factors when making the determination
to treat the RSUs as contingent consideration and not post-combination compensation, including, but not limited to, the following: (a)
the RSUs are not automatically forfeited upon termination of the two key employees as those RSUs would vest if the employees were terminated
without cause or if the employees resigned with good reasons; (b) all selling shareholders of BizSecure receive the same pro rata compensation;
(c) the BizSecure shareholders hired by the Company receive compensation commensurate with other employees in the Company at the same
level; (d) there are no adjustments to the RSUs based on earnings and thus there is no profit-sharing component to the RSUs; and (e)
the parties desired for the compensation to be paid over time and not all up front. Therefore, the Company determined that the restricted
stock units should be treated as contingent consideration.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Based
on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d)
and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, our management
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all
errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. The design
of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Board
of Directors and Corporate Governance 

When
considering whether directors have the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills to enable the Board of Directors to satisfy
its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of our business and structure, the Board of Directors focuses primarily on the information
discussed in each of the directors individual biographies as set forth above. With regard to Mr. Foote, the Board considered their
day-to-day operational leadership of our company and in-depth knowledge of our business and experience in corporate management that will
assist our corporate governance. 

The
Board of Directors periodically reviews relationships that directors have with our company to determine whether the directors are independent.
Directors are considered independent as long as they do not accept any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee (other
than director fees) from us, are not an affiliated person of our company or our subsidiaries (e.g., an officer or a greater than 10 
stockholder) and are independent within the meaning of applicable United States laws, regulations and the Nasdaq Capital Market listing
rules. In this latter regard, the Board of Directors uses the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules (specifically, Section 5605(a)(2) of such rules)
as a benchmark for determining which, if any, of our directors are independent, solely in order to comply with applicable SEC disclosure
rules. 

Director
or Officer Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 

Our
directors and executive officers were not involved in any legal proceedings as described in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K in the past
ten years. 

Directors
and Officers Liability Insurance 

HUMBL
has had a directors and officers liability insurance policy in place since September 7, 2021. Our officers and directors
have indemnification rights under applicable laws, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. 

Committees
of the Board of Directors 

Our
Board of Directors has appointed an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee, each
of which has the composition and responsibilities described below. 

Audit
Committee 

The
Company s audit committee consists of Peter Schulte and Jeffrey Hinshaw. The Board has determined that Mr. Schulte are financially literate and qualify as independent directors under Section 5605(a)(2) and Section 5605(c)(2) of the Nasdaq rules. Peter
Schulte will be the chairman of our audit committee and he qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii)
of Regulation S-K. 

Our
audit committee has adopted a written audit committee charter, viewable at https://humbl.com/auditcommittee, that provides that the functions
of our audit committee include, among other things: 

selecting
 a qualified firm to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial statements; 

helping
 to ensure the independence and performance of the independent registered public accounting firm;

 the scope and results of the audit with the independent registered public accounting firm, and reviewing, with management and the
 independent accountants, our interim and year-end operating results; 

developing
 procedures for employees to submit concerns anonymously about questionable accounting or audit matters; 

reviewing
 our policies on risk assessment and risk management; 

87 

 Table of Contents

 procedures, any material issues with such procedures, and any steps taken to deal with such issues when required by applicable law;
 and 

approving
 (or, as permitted, pre-approving) all audit and all permissible non-audit services, other than de minimis non-audit services, to
 be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. 

Compensation
Committee 

Our
compensation committee is comprised of Peter Schulte and Brian Foote. Our board has determined that each of Mr. Schulte qualifies as an independent director under Section 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq rules and a non-employee director for purposes
of Section 16b-3 under the Exchange Act and does not have a material relationship with us that would affect his ability to be independent
from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member, as described in Section 5605(d)(2) of the Nasdaq rules.
Mr. Schulte will be the chairman of our compensation committee. 

Our
compensation committee has adopted a written compensation committee charter, viewable at https://humbl.com/compensationcommittee, that
provides that the functions of our compensation committee include, among other things: 

reviewing
 and approving, or recommending to our board of directors for approval, the compensation of our executive officers and any compensatory
 arrangement with our executive officers; 

reviewing
 and recommending to our board of directors for approval the compensation of our directors and any changes to their compensation; 

reviewing
 and approving, or recommending to our board of directors for approval, and administering incentive compensation and equity incentive
 plans; and 

reviewing
 and establishing general policies relating to compensation and benefits of our employees and reviewing our overall compensation philosophy. 

Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee 

Our
corporate governance committee is comprised of Peter. Schulte and Michele Rivera. Our board has determined that each of Mr. Schulte qualifies as an independent director under Section 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq rules. Mr. Schulte is the chairman of our nominating
and corporate governance committee. 

Our
nominating and corporate governance committee will have adopted a written nominating and corporate governance committee charter, viewable
at https://humbl.com/nominatingandgovernance, that provides that the functions of our nominating and corporate governance committee include,
among other things: 

identifying,

 and its committees; 

overseeing
 the evaluation and the performance of our board of directors and of individual directors; 

considering
 and making recommendations to our board of directors regarding the composition of our board of directors and its committees;

Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 

None
of our directors or executive officers serves as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any other entity that
has one or more of its executive officers serving as a member of our board of directors. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have adopted a written code of ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees in accordance with the rules of OTC Markets and the SEC. We will post a copy of our code of ethics on our website, and intend to post amendments to this code,
or any waivers of its requirements, as well. 

Conflicts
of Interest 

We
comply with applicable state law with respect to transactions (including business opportunities) involving potential conflicts. Applicable
state corporate law requires that all transactions involving our company and any director or executive officer (or other entities with
which they are affiliated) are subject to full disclosure and approval of the majority of the disinterested independent members of our
Board of Directors, approval of the majority of our stockholders or the determination that the contract or transaction is intrinsically
fair to us. More particularly, our policy is to have any related party transaction i.e. , transactions involving a director, an
officer or an affiliate of our company) be approved solely by a majority of the disinterested independent directors serving on the Board
of Directors. We expect to have at least three independent directors serving on the Board of Directors and intend to maintain a Board
of Directors consisting of a majority of independent directors. 

Indemnification
of Directors and Executive Officers 

Section
145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides for, under certain circumstances, the indemnification of our officers, directors,
employees and agents against liabilities that they may incur in such capacities. Below is a summary of the circumstances in which such
indemnification is provided. 

In
general, the statute provides that any director, officer, employee or agent of a corporation may be indemnified against expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred in a proceeding (including
any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative proceeding) to which the individual was a party by reason of such status. Such indemnity
may be provided if the indemnified person s actions resulting in the liabilities: (i) were taken in good faith; (ii) were reasonably
believed to have been in or not opposed to our best interests; and (iii) with respect to any criminal action, such person had no reasonable
cause to believe the actions were unlawful. Unless ordered by a court, indemnification generally may be awarded only after a determination
of independent members of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, by independent legal counsel or by vote of the stockholders
that the applicable standard of conduct was met by the individual to be indemnified. 

The
statutory provisions further provide that to the extent a director, officer, employee or agent is wholly successful on the merits or
otherwise in defense of any proceeding to which he or she was a party, he or she is entitled to receive indemnification against expenses,
including attorneys fees, actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the proceeding. 

89 

 Table of Contents 

Indemnification
in connection with a proceeding by us or in our right in which the director, officer, employee or agent is successful is permitted only
with respect to expenses, including attorneys fees actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense. In such actions,
the person to be indemnified must have acted in good faith, in a manner believed to have been in our best interests and must not have
been adjudged liable to us, unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person
is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expense which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. Indemnification
is otherwise prohibited in connection with a proceeding brought on our behalf in which a director is adjudged liable to us, or in connection
with any proceeding charging improper personal benefit to the director in which the director is adjudged liable for receipt of an improper
personal benefit. 

Delaware
law authorizes us to reimburse or pay reasonable expenses incurred by a director, officer, employee or agent in connection with a proceeding
in advance of a final disposition of the matter. Such advances of expenses are permitted if the person furnishes to us a written agreement
to repay such advances if it is determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by us. 

The
statutory section cited above further specifies that any provisions for indemnification of or advances for expenses does not exclude
other rights under our certificate of incorporation, by-laws, resolutions of our stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.
These indemnification provisions continue for a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation
and inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such persons. 

The
statutory provision cited above also grants us the power to purchase and maintain insurance policies that protect any director, officer,
employee or agent against any liability asserted against or incurred by him or her in such capacity arising out of his or her status
as such. Such policies may provide for indemnification whether or not the corporation would otherwise have the power to provide for it. 

At
present, we do not maintain directors and officers liability insurance in order to limit the exposure to liability for
indemnification of directors and officers, including liabilities under the Securities Act; however, we are in the process of obtaining
such insurance. 

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

Compensation
Discussion and Analysis 

Compensation
Philosophy 

This
section discusses the principles underlying our policies and decisions with respect to the compensation of our executive officers and
what we believe are the most important factors relevant to an analysis of these policies and decisions. This section also describes the
material elements of compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to each of our named executive officers as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Our four named executive officer for 2022 were Brian Foote, Jeff Hinshaw and Michele Rivera, and Javier Gonzalez. The compensation
of our other current executive officers is based on individual terms approved by our board of directors. 

Our
compensation committee oversees these compensation policies and, together with our board of directors, periodically evaluates the need
for revisions to ensure our compensation program is competitive with the companies with which we compete for executive talent. 

Objectives
and Philosophy of Our Executive Compensation Program 

The
primary objectives of the board of directors in designing our executive compensation program are to: 

attract,
 retain and motivate experienced and talented executives; 

ensure
 executive compensation is aligned with our corporate strategies, research and development programs and business goals; 

90 

 Table of Contents 

recognize
 the individual contributions of executives while fostering a shared commitment among executives by aligning their individual goals
 with our corporate goals; 

promote
 the achievement of key strategic, development and operational performance measures by linking compensation to the achievement of
 measurable corporate and individual performance goals; and 

align
 the interests of our executives with our stockholders by rewarding performance that leads to the creation of stockholder value. 

Our
board of directors and compensation committee will evaluate our executive compensation program with the goal of setting and maintaining
compensation at levels that are justifiable based on each executive s level of experience, performance and responsibility and that
the board believes are competitive with those of other companies in our industry and our region that compete with us for executive talent.
In addition, our executive compensation program will tie a substantial portion of each executive s overall compensation to key
strategic, financial and operational goals. We have provided, and expect to continue to provide, a portion of our executive compensation
in the form of stock options and restricted stock that vest over time, which we believe helps to retain our executives and aligns their
interests with those of our stockholders by allowing them to participate in the longer-term success of our company as reflected in stock
price appreciation. 

Use
of Compensation Consultants and Market Benchmarking 

For
purposes of determining total compensation and the primary components of compensation for our executive officers in 2022, we did not
retain the services of a compensation consultant or use survey information or compensation data to engage in benchmarking. In the future,
we expect that our compensation committee will consider publicly available compensation data for national and regional companies in the
laser cleaning industry to help guide its executive compensation decisions at the time of hiring and for subsequent adjustments in compensation.
Even if we retain the services of an independent compensation consultant to provide additional comparative data on executive compensation
practices in our industry and to advise on our executive compensation program generally, our board of directors and future compensation
committee will ultimately make their own decisions about these matters. 

Our
annual cash bonus program is based upon the achievement of specified annual corporate and individual goals that will be established in
advance by our board of directors or compensation committee. Our annual cash bonus program emphasizes pay-for-performance and is intended
to closely align executive compensation with achievement of specified operating results as the amount is calculated on the basis of percentage
of corporate goals achieved. The performance goals established by our compensation committee is based on the business strategy of the
company and the objective of building stockholder value. There are three steps to determine if and the extent to which an annual cash
bonus is payable to a named executive officer. First, at the beginning of the year, our compensation committee determines the target
annual cash incentive award for the named executive officer based on a percentage of the officer s annual base salary for that
year. Second, the compensation committee establishes the specific performance goals, including both corporate and individual objectives,
that must be met for the officer to receive the award. Third, shortly after the end of the year, the compensation committee determines
the extent to which these performance goals were met and the amount of the award. Our compensation committee works with our chief executive
officer to develop corporate and individual goals that they believe can be reasonably achieved with hard work over the course of the
year and will target total cash compensation, consisting of base salaries and target annual cash bonuses.

Stock-Based
Awards 

Our
equity award program is the primary vehicle for offering long-term incentives to our executives. While we do not have any equity ownership
guidelines for our executives, we believe that equity grants provide our executives with a strong link to our long-term performance,
create an ownership culture and help to align the interests of our executives and our stockholders. In addition, the vesting feature
of our equity awards contributes to executive retention by providing an incentive for our executives to remain in our employ during the
vesting period. Currently, our executives are eligible to participate in our 2021 stock incentive plan, which we refer to as the 2019
Plan. Our employees and executives are eligible to receive stock-based awards pursuant to our 2019 Plan. Under our 2019 Plan, executives
are eligible to receive grants of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights and
other stock-based equity awards at the discretion of our board of directors. 

Our
employee equity awards are typically in the form of stock options. Because our executives profit from stock options only if our stock
price increases relative to the stock option s exercise price, we believe stock options provide meaningful incentives for our executives
to achieve increases in the value of our stock over time. While we currently expect to continue to use stock options as the primary form
of equity awards that we grant, we may in the future use alternative forms of equity awards, such as restricted stock and restricted
stock units. To date, we have generally used equity awards to compensate our executive officers in the form of initial grants in connection
with the commencement of employment. In the future, we also generally plan to grant equity awards on an annual basis to our executive
officers. We may also make additional discretionary grants, typically in connection with the promotion of an employee, to reward an employee,
for retention purposes or in other circumstances recommended by management. 

In
general, the equity awards that we expect to grant to our executives will vest with respect to 25 of the shares on the first anniversary
of the grant date and with respect to the remaining shares in approximately equal quarterly installments through the fourth anniversary
of the grant date. Vesting ceases upon termination of employment and exercise rights cease shortly after termination of employment. Prior
to the exercise of a stock option, the holder has no rights as a stockholder with respect to the shares subject to such option, including
voting rights or the right to receive dividends or dividend equivalents. 

We
will grant, stock options with exercise prices that are set at no less than the fair value of shares of our common stock on the date
of grant as determined by our board of directors. 

Benefits
and Other Compensation 

We
believe that establishing competitive benefit packages for our employees is an important factor in attracting and retaining highly qualified
personnel. We expect to maintain broad-based benefits that are provided to all employees, including health and dental insurance, life
and disability insurance, and a 401(k) plan. All of our executives will be eligible to participate in all of our employee benefit plans,
in each case on the same basis as other employees. 

In
certain circumstances, we may award cash signing bonuses or may reimburse relocation expenses when executives first join us. Whether
a signing bonus is paid or relocation expenses are reimbursed, and the amount of either such benefit, is determined by our board of directors
on a case-by-case basis based on the specific hiring circumstances and the recommendation of our chief executive officer. 

Severance
and Change in Control Benefits 

Pursuant
to agreements we expect to enter into with certain of our executives, these executives will be entitled to specified benefits in the
event of the termination of their employment under specified circumstances, including termination following a change in control of our
company. 

We
believe providing these benefits helps us compete for executive talent. Based on the substantial business experience of the members of
our board of directors, we believe that our severance and change in control benefits are generally in line with severance packages offered
to executives by companies at comparable stages of development in our industry and related industries.

Risk
Considerations in Our Compensation Program 

Our
board of directors is evaluating the philosophy and standards on which our compensation plans will be implemented across our company.
It is our belief that our compensation programs do not, and in the future will not, encourage inappropriate actions or risk taking by
our executive officers. We do not believe that any risks arising from our employee compensation policies and practices are reasonably
likely to have a material adverse effect on our company. In addition, we do not believe that the mix and design of the components of
our executive compensation program will encourage management to assume excessive risks. We believe that our current business process
and planning cycle fosters the behaviors and controls that would mitigate the potential for adverse risk caused by the action of our
executives. We believe that the following aspects of our executive compensation program that we plan to implement will mitigate the potential
for adverse risk caused by the action of our executives: 

annual
 establishment of corporate and individual objectives for our performance-based cash bonus programs for our executive officers, which
 we expect to be consistent with our annual operating and strategic plans, designed to achieve the proper risk/reward balance and
 not require excessive risk taking to achieve; 

the
 mix between fixed and variable, annual and long-term and cash and equity compensation, which we expect to be designed to encourage
 strategies and actions that balance the company s short-term and long-term best interests; and 

equity
 incentive awards that vest over a period of time, which we believe will encourage executives to take a long-term view of our business. 

Tax
and Accounting Considerations 

Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, generally disallows a tax deduction for compensation in excess
of 1,000,000 per person paid to a publicly traded company s chief executive officer and three other most highly paid officers,
other than the chief financial officer. Qualifying performance-based compensation is not subject to the deduction limitation if specified
requirements are met. We will periodically review the potential consequences of Section 162(m), however, the board of directors may,
in its judgment, authorize compensation payments that do not comply with the exemptions in Section 162(m) when it believes that such
payments are appropriate to attract and retain executive talent and are in the best interests of our stockholders. 

We
account for equity compensation paid to our employees in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standard
Codification Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , or ASC 718, which requires us to measure and recognize compensation
expense in our financial statements for all share-based payments based on an estimate of their fair value over the service period of
the award. We record cash compensation as an expense at the time the obligation is accrued.

Employment
and Advisory Agreements 

On
June 3, 2021, we entered into an employment agreement with Javier Gonzalez, our Chief Technology Officer and Juan Luis Gonzalez, the
CEO of our subsidiary, Tickeri, Inc. The employment agreements provide that each executive will receive a salary of 150,000 a year.
On January 6, 2023, Javier Gonzalez was terminated from his position as our CTO. On June 30, 2021, Doug Brandt and Kevin Childress entered
into employment agreements with our subsidiary, Monster Creative, LLC. Pursuant to those employment agreements, Mr. Brandt will be paid
 500,000 a year and Mr. Childress will be paid 400,000 a year. Mr. Brandt will act as Chief Executive Officer of Monster Creative, LLC
and Mr. Childress will act as President and Creative Director of Monster Creative, LLC. Mr. Childress resigned from his position at Monster
Creative, LLC on February 17, 2023. On July 13, 2021, we entered into a new employment agreement with Brian Foote, our Chairman, President
and Chief Executive Officer; Jeffrey Hinshaw, our Chief Operating Officer, and Corporate Secretary; and Michele Rivera, our Vice President,
Global Partnerships. The employment agreements are all in the same form and provide that Mr. Foote will receive a salary of 1 and each
of the other three officers will receive salaries of 90,000 a year. Mr. Hinshaw subsequently received a raise to 120,000 for 2022. 

Each
of the above employment agreements provides for termination by us upon the death or disability (defined as three aggregate months of
incapacity during any 365-consecutive day period) or upon conviction of a felony crime of moral turpitude or a material breach of his
obligations to us. In the event the employment agreement is terminated by us without cause or the employee resigns for good reason, the
terminated employee will be entitled to compensation for the balance of the term.

Each
executive also entered into a confidentiality and invention assignment agreement in conjunction with his or her employment agreement
which contains covenants prohibiting him or her from disclosure of confidential information regarding our company at any time. The employment
agreements for Juan Gonzalez, Javier Gonzalez, Doug Brandt and Kevin Childress also contain covenants restricting them from competing
against the Company and its subsidiaries during the term of their employment and for a period of time thereafter. 

Equity
Compensation Plan Information 

On
July 21, 2021, our Board of Directors and stockholders adopted our 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan ). The purpose
of the Plan is to provide an incentive to attract and retain directors, officers, consultants, advisors and employees whose services
are considered valuable, to encourage a sense of proprietorship, and to stimulate an active interest of these persons in our development
and financial success. Under the Plan, we are authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of Common Stock, including incentive stock
options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation
rights, performance shares, restricted stock and long-term incentive awards. 

Administration.
The 2021 Plan is administered by the Board of Directors or the committee or committees as may be appointed by the Board of Directors
from time to time (the Administrator ). The Administrator determines the persons who are to receive awards, the types of
awards to be granted, the number of shares subject to each such award and the terms and conditions of such awards. The Administrator
also has the authority to interpret the provisions of the 2021 Plan and of any awards granted there under and to modify awards granted
under the 2021 Plan. The Administrator may not, however, reduce the price of options or stock appreciation rights issued under the 2021
Plan without prior approval of the Company s shareholders. 

Eligibility.
The 2021 Plan provides that awards may be granted to employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Company or of any parent,
subsidiary or other affiliate of the Company as the Administrator may determine. A person may be granted more than one award under the
2021 Plan. 

Shares
that are subject to issuance upon exercise of an option under the 2021 Plan but cease to be subject to such option for any reason (other
than exercise of such option), and shares that are subject to an award granted under the 2021 Plan but are forfeited or repurchased by
the Company at the original issue price, or that are subject to an award that terminates without shares being issued, will again be available
for grant and issuance under the 2021 Plan. 

Terms
of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights. The Administrator determines many of the terms and conditions of each option and SAR granted
under the 2021 Plan, including whether the option is to be an incentive stock option or a non-qualified stock option, whether the SAR
is a related SAR or a freestanding SAR, the number of shares subject to each option or SAR, and the exercise price of the option and
the periods during which the option or SAR may be exercised. Each option and SAR is evidenced by a grant agreement in such form as the
Administrator approves and is subject to the following conditions (as described in further detail in the 2021 Plan): 

(a)
Vesting and Exercisability: Options, restricted shares and SARs become vested and exercisable, as applicable, within such periods, or
upon such events, as determined by the Administrator in its discretion and as set forth in the related grant agreement. The term of each
option is also set by the Administrator. However, a related SAR will be exercisable at the time or times, and only to the extent, that
the option is exercisable and will not be transferable except to the extent that the option is transferable. A freestanding SAR will
be exercisable as determined by the Administrator but in no event after 10 years from the date of grant. 

(b)
Exercise Price: Each grant agreement states the related option exercise price, which, in the case of SARs, may not be less than 100 
of the fair market value of the Company s shares of common stock on the date of the grant. The exercise price of an incentive stock
option granted to a 10 stockholder may not be less than 110 of the fair market value of shares of the Company s common stock
on the date of grant. 

(c)
Method of Exercise: The option exercise price is typically payable in cash, common stock or a combination of cash of common stock, as
determined by the Administrator, but may also be payable, at the discretion of the Administrator, in a number of other forms of consideration. 

95 

 Table of Contents 

(d)
Recapitalization; Change of Control: The number of shares subject to any award, and the number of shares issuable under the 2021 Plan,
are subject to proportionate adjustment in the event of a stock dividend, spin-off, split-up, recapitalization, merger, consolidation,
business combination or exchange of shares and the like. Except as otherwise provided in any written agreement between the participant
and the Company in effect when a change in control occurs, in the event an acquiring company does not assume plan awards (i) all outstanding
options and SARs shall become fully vested and exercisable; (ii) for performance-based awards, all performance goals or performance criteria
shall be deemed achieved at target levels and all other terms and conditions met, with award payout prorated for the portion of the performance
period completed as of the change in control and payment to occur within 45 days of the change in control; (iii) all restrictions and
conditional applicable to any restricted stock award shall lapse; (iv) all restrictions and conditions applicable to any restricted stock
units shall lapse and payment shall be made within 45 days of the change in control; and (v) all other awards shall be delivered or paid
within 45 days of the change in control. 

(e)
Other Provisions: The option grant and exercise agreements authorized under the 2021 Plan, which may be different for each option, may
contain such other provisions as the Administrator deems advisable, including without limitation, (i) restrictions upon the exercise
of the option and (ii) a right of repurchase in favor of the Company to repurchase unvested shares held by an optionee upon termination
of the optionee s employment at the original purchase price. 

Amendment
and Termination of the 2021 Plan. The Administrator, to the extent permitted by law, and with respect to any shares at the time not subject
to awards, may suspend or discontinue the 2021 Plan or amend the 2021 Plan in any respect; provided that the Administrator may not, without
approval of the stockholders, amend the 2021 Plan in a manner that requires stockholder approval. 

Grants
of Plan-Based Awards in 2022 

There
were no grants of plan-based awards to our named executive officers during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and as of December
31, 2022. 

Outstanding
Equity Awards at December 31, 2022 

There
were no outstanding equity awards held by our named executive officers as of December 31, 2022. 

Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation 

We
do not maintain any nonqualified deferred compensation plans. 

Defined
Contribution Plan 

We
do not currently have a defined contribution plan. 

2022
Director Compensation 

We
currently do not have a formal non-employee director compensation policy. However, in the event we have non-employee directors we intend
to reimburse them for their reasonable expenses incurred in connection with attending our board of directors and committee meetings,
and we may in the future grant stock options and pay cash compensation to those non-employee directors. 

Limitation
of Liability and Indemnification 

Our
certificate of incorporation provides that we are authorized to provide indemnification and advancement of expenses to our directors,
officers and other agents to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware General Corporation Law. 

96 

 Table of Contents 

In
addition, our certificate of incorporation limits the personal liability of directors for breach of fiduciary duty to the maximum extent
permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law and provides that no director will have personal liability to us or to our stockholders
for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty or other duty as a director. However, these provisions do not eliminate or limit the
liability of any of our directors for: 

any
 breach of the director s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders; 

any
 act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; 

unlawful
 payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; or 

any
 transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. 

Any
amendment to or repeal of these provisions will not eliminate or reduce the effect of these provisions in respect of any act, omission
or claim that occurred or arose prior to such amendment or repeal. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended to provide for
further limitations on the personal liability of directors of corporations, then the personal liability of our directors will be further
limited to the greatest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

Our
certificate of incorporation also provides that we must indemnify our directors and officers and we must advance expenses, including
attorneys fees, to our directors and officers in connection with legal proceedings, subject to very limited exceptions. 

We
maintain a general liability insurance policy that covers certain liabilities of our directors and officers arising out of claims based
on acts or omissions in their capacities as directors or officers. 

Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 

None
of our officers currently serves, or has served during the last completed fiscal year, on the compensation committee or board of directors
of any other entity that has one or more officers serving as a member of our board of directors. 

ITEM
12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

The
following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2022, certain information concerning the beneficial ownership of our capital stock, including
our common stock, and stock options as converted into common stock basis, by: 

each
 stockholder known by us to own beneficially 5 or more of any class of our outstanding stock; 

each
 director; 

each
 named executive officer; 

all
 of our executive officers and directors as a group; and 

each
 person, or group of affiliated persons, who is known by us to beneficially own more than 5 of any class of our outstanding stock. 

The
column entitled Percentage of Class is based on 2,182,343,775 shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022.
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and includes voting or investment power with
respect to our common stock. Shares of our common stock subject to options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days
of December 31, 2022, are considered outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding the options for the purpose of calculating
the percentage ownership of that person but not for the purpose of calculating the percentage ownership of any other person. Except as
otherwise noted, we believe the persons and entities in this table have sole voting and investing power with respect to all of the shares
of our common stock beneficially owned by them, subject to community property laws, where applicable.

ITEM
13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Since
December 31, 2020, we have engaged in the following transactions in an amount that exceeds 120,000 with our directors, executive officers,
holders of more than 5 of our voting securities, and affiliates or immediately family members of our directors, executive officers and
holders of more than 5 of our voting securities, and our co-founders. We believe that all of these transactions were on terms as favorable
as could have been obtained from unrelated third parties. 

Since
February 2, 2022, we have entered into five loan transactions with Sartorii, LLC, an entity owned by our CEO Brian Foote s parents.
All transactions were made at arm s length and approved by the disinterested directors. 

Policies
and Procedures for Related Person Transactions 

Our
board of directors has adopted written policies and procedures for the review of any transaction, arrangement or relationship in which
we are a participant, the amount involved exceeds the lesser of one percent of the average of our total assets for our last two fiscal
years or 120,000, and one of our executive officers, directors, director nominees or 5 stockholders (or their immediate family members),
each of whom we refer to as a related person, has a direct or indirect material interest. 

If
a related person proposes to enter into such a transaction, arrangement or relationship, which we refer to as a related person
transaction, the related person must report the proposed related person transaction to our chief legal officer or, in the event
we do not have a chief legal officer, to our principal financial officer. The policy calls for the proposed related person transaction
to be reviewed and, if deemed appropriate, approved by the audit committee of our board of directors. Whenever practicable, the reporting,
review and approval will occur prior to entry into the transaction. If advance review and approval is not practicable, the committee
will review, and, in its discretion, may ratify the related person transaction. The policy also permits the chairman of the committee
to review and, if deemed appropriate, approve proposed related person transactions that arise between committee meetings, subject to
ratification by the committee at its next meeting. Any related person transactions that are ongoing in nature will be reviewed annually. 

98 

 Table of Contents 

A
related person transaction reviewed under the policy will be considered approved or ratified if it is authorized by the committee after
full disclosure of the related person s interest in the transaction. As appropriate for the circumstances, the committee will review
and consider: 

the
 related person s interest in the related person transaction; 

the
 approximate dollar value of the amount involved in the related person transaction; 

the
 approximate dollar value of the amount of the related person s interest in the transaction without regard to the amount of
 any profit or loss; 

whether
 the transaction was undertaken in the ordinary course of our business; 

whether
 the terms of the transaction are no less favorable to us than terms that could have been reached with an unrelated third party; 

the
 purpose of, and the potential benefits to us of, the transaction; and 

any
 other information regarding the related person transaction or the related person in the context of the proposed transaction that
 would be material to investors in light of the circumstances of the particular transaction. 

The
committee may approve or ratify the transaction only if the committee determines that, under all of the circumstances, the transaction
is not inconsistent with our best interests. The committee may impose any conditions on the related person transaction that it deems
appropriate. 

In
addition to the transactions that are excluded by the instructions to the SEC s related person transaction disclosure rule, our
board of directors has determined that the following transactions do not create a material direct or indirect interest on behalf of related
persons and, therefore, are not related person transactions for purposes of this policy: 

interests
 arising solely from the related person s position as an executive officer of another entity (whether or not the person is also
 a director of such entity), that is a participant in the transaction, where (a) the related person and all other related persons
 own in the aggregate less than a 10 equity interest in such entity, (b) the related person and his or her immediate family members
 are not involved in the negotiation of the terms of the transaction and do not receive any special benefits as a result of the transaction
 and (c) the amount involved in the transaction equals less than the greater of 200,000 or 5 of the annual consolidated gross revenues
 of the other entity that is a party to the transaction; and 

a
 transaction that is specifically contemplated by provisions of our charter or by-laws. 

The
policy provides that transactions involving compensation of executive officers shall be reviewed and approved by the compensation committee
in the manner specified in its charter.

14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES 

Our
Board of Directors has approved BF Borgers CPA PC BFG to continue as our independent registered public accounting firm
to audit our financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. 

During
the Company s most recent fiscal years, neither we nor anyone acting on our behalf consulted with BFG regarding either (i) the
application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might
be rendered on our financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company that BFG concluded
was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue,
or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related
instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 

Fees
Paid to the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

for professional services for the audit of our financial statements included in our Form 10-K and interim review services of our
financial statements reported on Form 10-Q and for services that are normally provided by the registered public accounting firm in
connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. 

Auditor
Independence 

In
our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, there were no professional services provided, other than those listed above, that would require
our Board of Directors to consider their compatibility with maintaining the independence of BF Borgers CPA PC.
