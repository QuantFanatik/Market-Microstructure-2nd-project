 EXPLANATORY NOTE Overview Urban One, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries Urban One or the Company is filing this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 Form 10-K ). This Form 10-K contains our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as restates certain financial information and related footnote disclosures in the Company s previously issued consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021, as originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 15, 2022 (the Original Filing ), and then amended and filed with the SEC on October 11, 2022 (the Amended Filing and the interim periods ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2022 and 2021 (collectively, the Affected Periods ). This Form 10-K also restates certain other Items in the Original and Amended Filings, as listed in Items Restated in this Form 10-K below. Restatement Background As previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2023, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit Committee of the Company concluded, after discussion with the Company s management and independent registered public accounting firm, that the Company s previously issued consolidated financial statements with respect to the Affected Periods should no longer be relied upon due to errors in such financial statements, and, therefore, a restatement of these specified financial statements is required. The Company does not intend to file further amendments to the previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the Affected Periods. Accordingly, investors should rely only on the financial information and other disclosures regarding the Affected Periods in this Form 10-K or in future filings with the SEC (as applicable), and not on any previously issued or filed reports, press releases, earnings releases and investor presentations or other communications describing the Company s previously issued consolidated financial statements and other related financial information covering the Affected Periods. In connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the Company re-evaluated its accounting for the valuation of its investment interest in MGM National Harbor (the MGM Investment and determined that adjustments are required to its previously issued financial statements for the Affected Periods due to understatements in the value of the MGM Investment and related tax effects. In addition to the adjustment related to the MGM Investment, the Company included corrections for misstatements that were deemed immaterial to any period presented in our previously issued financial statements. These misstatements are related to radio broadcasting license impairment, right of use assets, fair value of the Reach Media redeemable noncontrolling interest, amortization of certain launch assets, misclassifications of certain balance sheet items, and any related tax effects. The Company also corrected certain line items within the statements of cash flows and certain disclosures relating to deferred tax assets and content assets for errors identified. See Note 2 - Restatement of Financial Statements and Note 17 - Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited and Restated) of our consolidated financial statements for more information related to the restatement, including descriptions of the misstatements and the impacts on the Company s consolidated financial statements. Internal Control Considerations The Company s management has concluded that the Company had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting during the Affected Periods relating to the errors described above. For a discussion of management s considerations of the Company s disclosures controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting, and material weaknesses identified, refer to Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures. Items Restated in this Form 10-K The following items have been restated, as appropriate, to reflect the restatement: Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Part II, Item 7.

 CERTAIN DEFINITIONS Unless otherwise noted, throughout this report, the terms Urban One, the Company, we, our, and us refer to Urban One, Inc. together with all of its subsidiaries. We use the terms local marketing agreement LMA or time brokerage agreement TBA in various places in this report. An LMA or a TBA is an agreement under which a Federal Communications Commission FCC licensee of a radio station makes available, for a fee, airtime on its station to another party. The other party provides programming to be broadcast during the airtime and collects revenues from advertising it sells for broadcast during that programming. In addition to entering into LMAs or TBAs, we will, from time to time, enter into management or consulting agreements that provide us with the ability, as contractually specified, to assist current owners in the management of radio station assets that we have contracted to purchase, subject to FCC approval. In such arrangements, we generally receive a contractually specified management fee or consulting fee in exchange for the services provided. The term broadcast and digital operating income is used throughout this report. Net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, income taxes, interest expense, interest income, noncontrolling interests in income of subsidiaries, other (income) expense, corporate selling, general and administrative, expenses, stock-based compensation, impairment of long-lived assets and (gain) loss on retirement of debt, is commonly referred to in the radio broadcasting industry as station operating income. However, given the diverse nature of our business, station operating income is not truly reflective of our multi-media operation and, therefore, we use the term broadcast and digital operating income. Broadcast and digital operating income is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). Nevertheless, broadcast and digital operating income is a significant basis used by our management to evaluate the operating performance of our core operating segments. Broadcast and digital operating income provides helpful information about our results of operations, apart from expenses associated with our fixed and long-lived intangible assets, income taxes, investments, impairment charges, debt financings and retirements, corporate overhead and stock-based compensation. Our measure of broadcast and digital operating income is similar to our historic use of station operating income; however, it reflects our more diverse business, and therefore, may not be similar to station operating income or other similarly titled measures as used by other companies. Broadcast and digital operating income does not represent operating income or loss, or cash flow from operating activities, as those terms are defined under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to those measurements as an indicator of our performance. Unless otherwise indicated: we obtained total radio industry revenue levels from the Radio Advertising Bureau (the RAB we obtained audience share and ranking information from Nielsen Audio, Inc. Nielsen and we derived historical market statistics and market revenue share percentages from data published by Miller, Kaplan, Arase Co., LLP Miller Kaplan ), a public accounting firm that specializes in serving the broadcasting industry and BIA/Kelsey BIA ), a media and telecommunications advisory services firm.

 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview Urban One, Inc. (a Delaware corporation originally formed in 1980 and hereinafter referred to as Urban One and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company is an urban-oriented, multi-media company that primarily targets African-American and urban consumers. Our core business is our radio broadcasting franchise which is the largest radio broadcasting operation that primarily targets African-American and urban listeners. As of December 31, 2022, we owned and/or operated 66 independently formatted, revenue producing broadcast stations (including 55 FM or AM stations, 9 HD stations, and the 2 low power television stations we operate), located in 13 of the most populous African-American markets in the United States. While a core source of our revenue has historically been and remains the sale of local and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations, our strategy is to operate the premier multi-media entertainment and information content platform targeting African-American and urban consumers. Thus, we have diversified our revenue streams by making acquisitions and investments in other complementary media properties. Our diverse media and entertainment interests include TV One, LLC TV One ), which operates two cable television networks targeting African-American and urban viewers, TV One and CLEO TV; our 80.0 ownership interest in Reach Media, Inc. Reach Media ), which operates the Rickey Smiley Morning Show and our other syndicated programming assets, including the Get Up! Mornings with Erica Campbell Show, Russ Parr Morning Show and the DL Hughley Show; and Interactive One, LLC Interactive One ), our wholly owned digital platform serving the African-American community through social content, news, information, and entertainment websites, including its iONE Digital, Cassius and Bossip, HipHopWired and MadameNoire digital platforms and brands. We also held a minority ownership interest in MGM National Harbor Casino, a gaming resort located in Prince George s County, Maryland. Through our national multi-media operations, we provide advertisers with a unique and powerful delivery mechanism to communicated with African-American and urban audiences. Our core radio broadcasting franchise operates under the brand Radio One. We also operate other media brands, such as TV One, CLEO TV, Reach Media, iONE Digital, and One Solution, while developing additional branding reflective of our diverse media operations and our targeting of African-American and urban audiences. Recent Developments On June 13, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with Emmis Communications Emmis to purchase its Indianapolis Radio Cluster to expand the Company s market share. The deal was subject to FCC approval and other customary closing conditions and, after obtaining the approvals, closed on August 31, 2022. Urban One acquired radio stations WYXB (B105.7FM), WLHK (97.1FM), WIBC (93.1FM), translators W228CX and W298BB (The Fan 93.5FM and 107.5FM), and Network Indiana for 25 million. As part of the transaction, the Company disposed of its former WHHH radio broadcasting license along with the intellectual property related to WNOW (there was a call letter change from WHHH to WNOW immediately prior to the close) to a third party for approximately 3.2 million. The fair value of the assets disposed of approximated the carrying value of the assets. Segments As part of our consolidated financial statements, consistent with our financial reporting structure and how the Company currently manages its businesses, we have provided selected financial information on the Company s four reportable segments: (i) radio broadcasting; (ii) cable television; (iii) Reach Media; and (iv) digital. Business activities unrelated to these four segments are included in an all other category which the Company refers to as All Other - Corporate/Eliminations. Our Radio Station Portfolio, Strategy and Markets As noted above, our core business is our radio broadcasting franchise which is the largest radio broadcasting operation in the country primarily targeting African-American and urban listeners. Within the markets in which we operate, we strive to build clusters of radio stations with each radio station targeting different demographic segments of the African-American population. This clustering and programming segmentation strategy allows us to achieve greater penetration within the

Table of Contents 
 distinct segments of our overall target market. In addition, we have been able to achieve operating efficiencies by consolidating office and studio space where possible to minimize duplicative management positions and reduce overhead expenses. Depending on market conditions, changes in ratings methodologies and economic and demographic shifts, from time to time, we may reprogram some of our stations in underperforming segments of certain markets. As of December 31, 2022, we owned and/or operated 66 independently formatted, revenue producing broadcast stations (including 55 FM or AM stations, 9 HD stations, and the 2 low power television stations we operate but excluding translators) located in 13 of the most populous African-American markets in the United States.

We consider our radio broadcasting segment to be our core radio business. Within our core radio business, seven (Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, and Washington, DC) of the 13 markets in which we operated radio stations throughout 2022 or a portion thereof accounted for approximately 73.8 of our radio station net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue from the operations of Reach Media, along with revenue from the seven significant contributing radio markets, accounted for approximately 32.5 of our total consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Adverse events or conditions (economic, including government cutbacks or otherwise) could lead to declines in the contribution of Reach Media or declines in one or more of the seven significant contributing radio markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial performance and results of operations.

 Radio Advertising Revenue Substantially all net revenue generated from our radio franchise is generated from the sale of local, national and network advertising. Local sales are made by the sales staff located in our markets. National sales are made primarily by Katz Communications, Inc. Katz ), a firm specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level. Katz is paid agency commissions on the advertising sold. Approximately 57.3 of our net revenue from our core radio business for the year ended December 31, 2022, was generated from the sale of local advertising and 38.8 from sales to national advertisers, including network/syndication advertising. The balance of net revenue from our radio segment is primarily derived from ticket sales, and revenue related to sponsored events, management fees and other alternative revenue. Advertising rates charged by radio stations are based primarily on: a radio station s audience share within the demographic groups targeted by the advertisers; the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups; and the supply and demand for radio advertising time. 
 A radio station s listenership is measured by the Portable People Meter TM (the PPM TM system or diary ratings surveys, both of which estimate the number of listeners tuned to a radio station and the time they spend listening to that radio station. Ratings are used by advertisers to evaluate whether to advertise on our radio stations, and are used by us to chart audience size, set advertising rates and adjust programming. Advertising rates are generally highest during the morning and afternoon commuting hours. Cable Television, Reach Media and Digital Segments, Strategy and Sources of Revenue and Income We have expanded our operations to include other media forms that are complementary to our radio business. In a strategy similar to our radio market segmentation, we have multiple complementary media and online brands. Each of these brands focuses on a different segment of African-American consumers. With our multiple brands, we are able to direct advertisers to specific audiences within the urban communities in which we are located, or to bundle the brands for advertising sales purposes when advantageous. TV One, our primary cable television franchise targeting the African-American and urban communities, derives its revenue from advertising and affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue is derived from the sale of television airtime to advertisers and is recognized when the advertisements are run. TV One also derives revenue from affiliate fees under the terms of various affiliation agreements generally based upon a per subscriber royalty for the right to distribute the Company s programming under the terms of the distribution contracts. Our other cable television franchise, CLEO TV, is a lifestyle and entertainment network targeting Millennial and Gen X women of color that is also operated by TV One, LLC. CLEO TV derives its revenue principally from advertising. Reach Media, our syndicated radio unit, primarily derives its revenue from the sale of advertising in connection with its syndicated radio shows, including the Rickey Smiley Morning Show, Get Up! Mornings with Erica Campbell, the Russ Parr Morning Show, and the DL Hughley Show. In addition to being broadcast on 48 Urban One stations, our syndicated radio programming also was available on 215 non-Urban One stations throughout the United States as of December 31, 2022. We have launched websites that simultaneously stream radio station content for each of our radio stations, and we derive revenue from the sale of advertisements on those websites. We generally encourage our web advertisers to run simultaneous radio campaigns and use mentions in our radio airtime to promote our websites. By providing streaming, we have been able to broaden our listener reach, particularly to office hour listeners, including at home office hour listeners. We believe streaming has had a positive impact on our radio stations reach to listeners. In addition, our station websites link to our other online properties operated by our primary digital unit, Interactive One. Interactive One operates the largest social networking site primarily targeting African-Americans and other branded websites, including Bossip,

 HipHopWired and MadameNoire. Interactive One derives revenue from advertising services on non-radio station branded websites, and studio services where Interactive One provides services to other publishers. Advertising services include the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements. Advertising revenue is recognized as impressions (the number of times advertisements appear in viewed pages) are delivered. Finally, our MGM National Harbor investment entitled us to an annual cash distribution based on net gaming revenue from gaming activities conducted on the site of the facility. In March 2023, the Company exercised the put option available to it and received approximately 136.8 million at the time of settlement of the put option in April 2023. Please refer to Note 18 Subsequent Events of our consolidated financial statements for further details. Future opportunities could include investments in, acquisitions of, or the development of companies in diverse media businesses, gaming and entertainment, music production and distribution, movie distribution, internet-based services, and distribution of our content through emerging distribution systems such as the Internet, smartphones, cellular phones, tablets, and the home entertainment market. Competition The media industry is highly competitive and we face intense competition across our core radio franchise and all of our complementary media properties. Our media properties compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other radio stations and with other media such as broadcast and cable television, the Internet, satellite radio, newspapers, magazines, direct mail and outdoor advertising, some of which may be owned or controlled by horizontally-integrated companies. Audience ratings and advertising revenue are subject to change and any adverse change in a market could adversely affect our net revenue in that market. If a competing radio station converts to a format similar to that of one of our radio stations, or if one of our competitors strengthens its signal or operations, our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and advertising revenue. Other media companies which are larger and have more resources may also enter or increase their presence in markets or segments in which we operate. Although we believe our media properties are well positioned to compete, we cannot assure you that our properties will maintain or increase their current ratings, market share or advertising revenue. Providing content across various platforms is a highly competitive business. Our digital and cable television segments compete for the time and attention of internet users and viewers and, thus, advertisers and advertising revenues with a wide range of internet companies such as Amazon TM , Netflix TM , Yahoo! TM , Google TM , and Microsoft TM , with social networking sites such as Facebook TM and TikTok TM and with traditional media companies, which are increasingly offering their own digital products and services both organically and through acquisition. We experience competition for the development and acquisition of content, distribution of content, sale of commercial time on our digital and cable television networks and viewership. There is competition from other digital companies, production studios and other television networks for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers, producers and directors. Our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our content, attracting viewers and the sale of advertising. Our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience, the distribution of our content, viewership, and the production, marketing and advertising support we provide. Our TV One and CLEO TV cable television networks compete with other networks and platforms for the acquisition and distribution of content and for fees charged to cable television operators, DTH satellite service providers, and other distributors that carry our content. Our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences. Our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Growth in the number of networks distributed, consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry, and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place. The ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production, acquisition and packaging of original content, viewership, the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors, the product offering across a series of networks within a region, and the prices charged for carriage. Our networks and digital products compete with other television networks, including broadcast, cable, local networks and other content distribution outlets for their target audiences and the sale of advertising. Our success in selling advertising 
 13 

Table of Contents 
 is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network, the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content, the brand appeal of the network and ratings/algorithms as determined by third-party research companies or search engines, prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace. Federal Antitrust Laws The agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws, the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice, may investigate certain acquisitions. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific FTC or Department of Justice investigation. Any decision by the FTC or the Department of Justice to challenge a proposed acquisition could affect our ability to consummate the acquisition or to consummate it on the proposed terms. For an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 requires the parties to file Notification and Report Forms concerning antitrust issues with the FTC and the Department of Justice and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition. Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting The radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing regulation by the FCC and other federal agencies of ownership, programming, technical operations, employment and other business practices. The FCC regulates radio broadcast stations pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act ). The Communications Act permits the operation of radio broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of a license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. Among other things, the FCC: assigns frequency bands for radio broadcasting; 
 determines the particular frequencies, locations, operating power, interference standards, and other technical parameters for radio broadcast stations; issues, renews, revokes and modifies radio broadcast station licenses; imposes annual regulatory fees and application processing fees to recover its administrative costs; establishes technical requirements for certain transmitting equipment to restrict harmful emissions; adopts and implements regulations and policies that affect the ownership, operation, program content, employment, and business practices of radio broadcast stations; and has the power to impose penalties, including monetary forfeitures, for violations of its rules and the Communications Act. 
 The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of an FCC license, or the transfer of control of an FCC licensee, without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant or renew a radio broadcast license or consent to the assignment or transfer of control of a license, the FCC considers a number of factors, including restrictions on foreign ownership, compliance with FCC media ownership limits and other FCC rules, the character and other qualifications of the licensee (or proposed licensee) and compliance with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. A licensee s failure to comply with the requirements of the Communications Act or FCC rules and policies may result in the imposition of sanctions, including admonishment, fines, the grant of a license renewal for less than a full eight-year term or with conditions, denial of a license renewal application, the revocation of an FCC license, and/or the denial of FCC consent to acquire additional broadcast properties. Congress, the FCC and, in some cases, other federal agencies and local jurisdictions are considering or may in the future consider and adopt new laws, regulations and policies that could affect the operation, ownership and profitability of 
 14 

Table of Contents 
 our radio stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenue for our radio broadcast stations or affect our ability to acquire additional radio broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions. Such matters include or may include: changes to the license authorization and renewal process; proposals to increase record keeping, including enhanced disclosure of stations efforts to serve the public interest; proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on FCC licensees; changes to rules relating to political broadcasting, including proposals to grant free airtime to candidates, and other changes regarding political and non-political program content, political advertising rates and sponsorship disclosures; revised rules and policies regarding the regulation of the broadcast of indecent content; proposals to increase the actions stations must take to demonstrate service to their local communities; technical and frequency allocation matters; changes in broadcast multiple ownership, foreign ownership, cross-ownership and ownership attribution rules and policies; service and technical rules for digital radio, including possible additional public interest requirements for terrestrial digital audio broadcasters; legislation that would provide for the payment of sound recording royalties to artists, musicians or record companies whose music is played on terrestrial radio stations; and changes to tax laws affecting broadcast operations and acquisitions. 
 The FCC also has adopted procedures for the auction of broadcast spectrum in circumstances where two or more parties have filed mutually exclusive applications for authority to construct new stations or certain major changes in existing stations. Such procedures may limit our efforts to modify or expand the broadcast signals of our stations. We cannot predict what changes, if any, might be adopted or considered in the future, or what impact, if any, the implementation of any particular proposals or changes might have on our business. FCC License Grants and Renewals . In making licensing determinations, the FCC considers an applicant s legal, technical, character and other qualifications. The FCC grants radio broadcast station licenses for specific periods of time and, upon application, may renew them for additional terms. A station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application is pending. Under the Communications Act, radio broadcast station licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years. Generally, the FCC renews radio broadcast licenses without a hearing upon a finding that: the radio station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations; and 
 15 

Table of Contents 
 there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse. 
 After considering these factors and any petitions to deny or informal objections against a license renewal application (which may lead to a hearing), the FCC may grant the license renewal application with or without conditions, including renewal for a term less than the maximum otherwise permitted. Historically, our licenses have been renewed for full eight-year terms without any conditions or sanctions; however, there can be no assurance that the licenses of each of our stations will be renewed for a full term without conditions or sanctions. Types of FCC Broadcast Licenses. The FCC classifies each AM and FM radio station. An AM radio station operates on either a clear channel, regional channel or local channel. A clear channel serves wide areas, particularly at night. A regional channel serves primarily a principal population center and the contiguous rural areas. A local channel serves primarily a community and the suburban and rural areas immediately contiguous to it. AM radio stations are designated as Class A, Class B, Class C or Class D. Class A, B and C stations each operate unlimited time. Class A radio stations render primary and secondary service over an extended area. Class B stations render service only over a primary service area. Class C stations render service only over a primary service area that may be reduced as a consequence of interference. Class D stations operate either during daytime hours only, during limited times only, or unlimited time with low nighttime power. FM class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter of the FM radio station is located. The minimum and maximum facilities requirements for an FM radio station are determined by its class. In general, commercial FM radio stations are classified as follows, in order of increasing power and antenna height: Class A, B1, C3, B, C2, C1, C0 and C. The FCC has adopted a rule subjecting Class C FM stations that do not satisfy a certain antenna height requirement to an involuntary downgrade in class to Class C0 under certain circumstances. Urban One s Licenses . The following table sets forth information with respect to each of our radio stations for which we held the license as of December 31, 2022. Stations which we did not own as of December 31, 2022, but operated under an LMA, are not reflected on this table. A broadcast station s market may be different from its community of license. The coverage of an AM radio station is chiefly a function of the power of the radio station s transmitter, less dissipative power losses and any directional antenna adjustments. For FM radio stations, signal coverage area is chiefly a function of the radio station s ERP and the HAAT of the radio station s antenna. ERP refers to the effective radiated power of an FM

 radio station. HAAT refers to the antenna height above average terrain of an FM radio station antenna. The table below excludes HD radio and LPTV stations.

 To obtain the FCC s prior consent to assign or transfer control of a broadcast license, an appropriate application must be filed with the FCC. If the assignment or transfer involves a substantial change in ownership or control of the licensee, for example, the transfer of more than 50 of the voting stock, the applicant must give public notice and the application is subject to a 30-day period for public comment. During this time, interested parties may file petitions with the FCC to deny the application. Informal objections may be filed at any time until the FCC acts upon the application. If the FCC grants an assignment or transfer application, administrative procedures provide for petitions seeking reconsideration or full FCC review of the grant. The Communications Act also permits the appeal of a contested grant to a federal court. Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any person who is not a U.S. citizen or by any entity that has more than 20 of its capital stock owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities or their representatives, or by foreign governments or their representatives. The Communications Act prohibits more than 25 indirect foreign ownership or control of a licensee through a parent company if the FCC determines the public interest will be served by such prohibition. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before this 25 limit may be exceeded. Since we serve as a holding company for subsidiaries that serve as licensees for our stations, we are effectively restricted from having more than one-fourth of our stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, foreign governments, representatives of foreign governments, or foreign business entities unless we seek and obtain FCC authority to exceed that level. The FCC will entertain and authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing and favorable executive branch review, proposals to exceed the 25 indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcast licensees. The FCC applies its media ownership limits to attributable interests. The interests of officers, directors and those who directly or indirectly hold five percent or more of the total outstanding voting stock of a corporation that holds a broadcast license (or a corporate parent) are generally deemed attributable interests, as are any limited partnership or limited liability company interests that are not properly insulated from management activities. Certain passive investors that hold stock for investment purposes only are deemed attributable with the ownership of 20 or more of the voting stock of a licensee or parent corporation. An entity with one or more radio stations in a market that enters into a local marketing agreement or a time brokerage agreement with another radio station in the same market obtains an attributable interest in the brokered radio station if the brokering station supplies programming for more than 15 of the brokered radio station s weekly broadcast hours. Similarly, a radio station owner s right under a joint sales agreement JSA to sell more than 15 per week of the advertising time on another radio station in the same market constitutes an attributable ownership interest in such station for purposes of the FCC s ownership rules. Debt instruments, non-voting stock, unexercised options and warrants, minority voting interests in corporations having a single majority shareholder, and limited partnership or limited liability company membership interests where the interest holder is not materially involved in the media-related activities of the partnership or limited liability company pursuant to FCC-prescribed insulation provisions, generally do not subject their holders to attribution unless such interests implicate the FCC s equity-debt-plus (or EDP rule. Under the EDP rule, a major programming supplier or the holder of an attributable interest in a same-market radio station will have an attributable interest in a station if the supplier or same-market media entity also holds debt or equity, or both, in the station that is greater than 33 of the value of the station s total debt plus equity. For purposes of the EDP rule, equity includes all stock, whether voting or nonvoting, and interests held by limited partners or limited liability company members that are insulated from material involvement in the company s media activities. A major programming supplier is any supplier that provides more than 15 of the station s weekly programming hours. The Communications Act and FCC rules generally restrict ownership, operation or control of, or the common holding of attributable interests in, radio broadcast stations serving the same local market in excess of specified numerical limits. The numerical limits on radio stations that one entity may own in a local market are as follows: in a radio market with 45 or more commercial radio stations, a party may hold an attributable interest in up to eight commercial radio stations, not more than five of which are in the same service (AM or FM); in a radio market with 30 to 44 commercial radio stations, a party may hold an attributable interest in up to seven commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service (AM or FM); 
 18 

Table of Contents 
 in a radio market with 15 to 29 commercial radio stations, a party may hold an attributable interest in up to six commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service (AM or FM); and in a radio market with 14 or fewer commercial radio stations, a party may hold an attributable interest in up to five commercial radio stations, not more than three of which are in the same service (AM or FM), except that a party may not hold an attributable interest in more than 50 of the radio stations in such market. 
 To apply these tiers, the FCC currently relies on Nielsen Metro Survey Areas, where they exist. In other areas, the FCC relies on a contour-overlap methodology. The FCC has initiated a rulemaking to determine how to define local radio markets in areas located outside Nielsen Metro Survey Areas. The market definition used by the FCC in applying its ownership rules may not be the same as that used for purposes of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. In 2003, when the FCC changed its methodology for defining local radio markets, it grandfathered existing combinations of radio stations that would not comply with the modified rules. The FCC s rules provide that these grandfathered combinations may not be sold intact except to certain eligible entities, which the FCC defines as entities qualifying as a small business consistent with Small Business Administration standards. The media ownership rules are subject to review by the FCC every four years. In August 2016, the FCC issued an order concluding its 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews. The August 2016 decision retained the local radio ownership rule and limitations on radio/television cross-ownership and newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership without significant changes. In November 2017, the FCC adopted an order reconsidering the August 2016 decision and modifying it in a number of respects. The November 2017 order on reconsideration did not significantly modify the August 2016 decision with respect to the local radio ownership limits. It did, however, eliminate the FCC s previous limits on radio/television cross-ownership and newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership. In September 2019, a federal appeals court vacated the FCC s November 2017 order on reconsideration, as a result of which the radio/television and newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rules were reinstated. On April 1, 2021, however, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the September 2019 appeals court ruling, resulting in the elimination of the radio/television and newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rules effective June 30, 2021. The FCC s 2018 and 2022 quadrennial reviews of its media ownership rules, which commenced in December 2018 and December 2022 respectively, are currently pending. The attribution and media ownership rules limit the number of radio stations we may acquire or own in any particular market and may limit the prospective buyers of any stations we want to sell. The FCC s rules could affect our business in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, the following: the FCC s radio ownership limits could have an adverse effect on our ability to accumulate stations in a given area or to sell a group of stations in a local market to a single entity; restricting the assignment and transfer of control of grandfathered radio combinations that exceed the ownership limits as a result of the FCC s 2003 change in local market definition could adversely affect our ability to buy or sell a group of stations in a local market from or to a single entity; and in general terms, future changes in the way the FCC defines radio markets or in the numerical station caps could limit our ability to acquire new stations in certain markets, our ability to operate stations pursuant to certain agreements, and our ability to improve the coverage contours of our existing stations. 
 Programming and Operations. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest by presenting programming that responds to community problems, needs and interests and by maintaining records demonstrating such responsiveness. The FCC considers complaints from viewers or listeners about a broadcast station s programming. All radio stations are now required to maintain their public inspection files on a publicly accessible FCC-hosted online database. Moreover, the FCC has from time to time proposed rules designed to increase local programming content and diversity, including renewal application processing guidelines for locally-oriented programming and a requirement that broadcasters establish advisory boards in the communities where they own stations. Stations also must follow FCC rules and policies regulating political advertising, obscene or indecent programming, sponsorship

 identification, contests and lotteries and technical operation, including limits on human exposure to radio frequency radiation. The FCC requires that licensees not discriminate in hiring practices on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin or gender. It also requires stations with at least five full-time employees to broadly disseminate information about all full-time job openings and undertake outreach initiatives from an FCC list of activities such as participation in job fairs, internships, or scholarship programs. The FCC is considering whether to apply these recruitment requirements to part-time employment positions. Stations must retain records of their outreach efforts and keep an annual Equal Employment Opportunity EEO report in their public inspection files and post an electronic version on their websites. From time to time, complaints may be filed against any of our radio stations alleging violations of these or other rules. In addition, the FCC may conduct audits or inspections to ensure and verify licensee compliance with FCC rules and regulations. Failure to observe these or other rules and regulations can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including fines or conditions, the grant of short (less than the maximum eight year) renewal terms or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a license. Human Capital As of December 31, 2022, we employed 881 full-time employees and 408 part-time employees. Our employees are not unionized. We believe that our success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, development programs that enable continued learning and growth, and offer an employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. As a business founded by an African-American woman, diversity and inclusion is engrained in our corporate history. Our Board of Directors is diverse; Catherine L. Hughes, our Founder and Chairperson, is an African-American woman, and four of our six directors are minorities. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is also a director, Alfred C. Liggins, III is an African-American male, as is our Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Kristopher Simpson. Further, Karen Wishart, our Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer, is an African-American woman, as is Michelle Rice, President of TV ONE. As of December 31, 2022, 74 of our employees were racially diverse, and 45 of our employees were women. We are proud that our organization is governed and propelled by such a diverse group of individuals, which we believe contributes to our Company s success now, and in the long-term. Our senior leadership team has introduced various initiatives to ensure that our Co mpany remains inclusive and supportive for all, including: (i) conducting workplace training, which includes focuses on unconscious bias, discrimination and harassment; (ii) leveraging a diverse slate of candidates for all job vacancies, including senior leadership; and (iii) developing content across our multi-media platform that elevates the voice of minority communities to foster equality and inclusion in both the entertainment industry and across the nation . Environmental As the owner, lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities, we are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance, however, that compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations will not require us to make significant expenditures in the future. Seasonality Seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the radio broadcasting industry and are due primarily to fluctuations in advertising expenditures. Typically, revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year. Due to this seasonality and certain other factors, the results of interim periods may not necessarily be indicative of results for the full year. In

 addition, our operations are impacted by political cycles and generally experience higher revenues in congressional and presidential election years. This cyclicity may affect comparability between years. Corporate Governance Code of Ethics. We have adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers (including our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) and employees and meets the requirements of the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules. Our code of ethics can be found on our website, www.urban1.com. We will provide a paper copy of the code of ethics, free of charge, upon request. Audit Committee Charter. Our audit committee has adopted a charter as required by the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules. This committee charter can be found on our website, www.urban1.com. We will provide a paper copy of the audit committee charter, free of charge, upon request. Compensation Committee Charter. Our Board of Directors has adopted a compensation committee charter. We will provide a paper copy of the compensation committee charter, free of charge, upon request. Internet Address and Internet Access to SEC Reports Our internet address is www.urban1.com. You may obtain through our internet website, free of charge, copies of our proxies, annual reports on Form 10-K and 10-K/A, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-Q/A, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These reports are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with or furnish them to the SEC. Our website and the information contained therein or connected thereto shall not be deemed to be incorporated into this Form 10-K. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business and Industry In an enterprise as large and complex as ours, a wide range of factors could affect our business and financial results. The factors described below are considered to be the most significant, but are not listed in any particular order. There may be other currently unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have material adverse effects on our future results. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. As discussed in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures of this Form 10-K, management has concluded that our internal controls related to certain business processes and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to the identified material weaknesses. In addition, as discussed in Note 2 Restatement of Financial Statements , management and our Audit Committee, after discussion with our independent registered public accounting firm, concluded that our previously issued financial statements for the Affected Periods should be restated due to understatements in the value of the MGM Investment. The restatement related to our material weakness in internal control over financial reporting over the investments in MGM National Harbor. In addition to the adjustments related to the MGM Investment, the Company also included corrections for previously identified out-of-period misstatements relating to radio broadcasting license impairment, misstatements relating to its right of use assets, misstatements relating to the fair value of the Reach Media redeemable noncontrolling

 interest, amortization of certain launch assets, misclassifications of certain line items in the balance sheets and statements of cash flows, and any related tax effects. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. Management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control An Integrated Framework. We are actively engaged in remediation efforts designed to address these material weaknesses. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. The material weaknesses, or a failure to promptly remediate them, may adversely affect our business, our reputation, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. If we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses in a timely manner, our investors, customers and other business partners may lose confidence in our business or our financial reports, and our access to capital markets may be adversely affected. In addition, our ability to record, process, and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory authorities, could be adversely affected, which may result in violations of applicable securities laws, stock exchange listing requirements and the covenants under our debt agreements. We could also be exposed to lawsuits, investigations, or other legal actions. In such actions, a governmental authority may interpret a law, regulation or accounting principle differently than we have, exposing us to different or additional risks. We could incur significant costs in connection with these actions. We have not accrued for any such liabilities. The control deficiencies resulting in the material weaknesses, in the aggregate, if not effectively remediated could also result in misstatements of accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. In addition, we cannot be certain that we will not identify additional control deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future. If we identify future control deficiencies or material weaknesses, these may lead to adverse effects on our business, our reputation, our results of operations, and the market price of our common stock. We face risks related to the restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements with respect to the Affected Periods. As discussed in the Explanatory Note and in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K, we reached a determination to restate certain financial information and related footnote disclosures in our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the Affected Periods. As a result, we have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, which may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures and may raise reputational issues for our business. We expect to continue to face many of the risks and challenges related to the restatement, including the following: we may face potential for litigation or other disputes, which may include, among others, claims invoking the federal and state securities laws, contractual claims or other claims arising from the restatement; and the processes undertaken to effect the restatement may not have been adequate to identify and correct all errors in our historical financial statements and, as a result, we may discover additional errors and our financial statements remain subject to the risk of future restatement. We cannot assure that all of the risks and challenges described above will be eliminated or that general reputational harm will not persist. If one or more of the foregoing risks or challenges persist, our business, operations and financial condition are likely to be materially and adversely affected.

 The restatement of our previously issued financial statements has been time-consuming and expensive and could expose us to additional risks that could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We have incurred significant expenses, including audit, legal, consulting and other professional fees, in connection with the restatement of our previously issued financial statements and the ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We have implemented and will continue to implement additional processes utilizing existing resources and adding new resources as needed. To the extent these steps are not successful, we could be forced to incur additional time and expense. Our management s attention has also been diverted from the operation of our business in connection with the restatements and ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in our internal controls. The delayed filing of our annual report has made us currently ineligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which could adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions. As a result of the delayed filing of our annual report with the SEC, we will not be eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a short form registration statement on Form S-3 until one year from the date we regain and maintain status as a current filer. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public prior to the time we are eligible to use a short form registration statement on Form S-3, both our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to timely execute any such transaction successfully and potentially harming our financial condition. Risks Related to the Nature and Operations of Our Business Impact of Public Health Crisis An epidemic or pandemic disease outbreak, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has caused, and may cause in the future, disruption to the media industry and to our business operations. Preventative and protective measures taken by governmental authorities and private actors in response to a global health crisis may disrupt the ways in which Americans live, work and spend. Further, the demand for advertising across our various segments/platforms is linked to the level of economic activity and employment in the U.S. and the ways in and rates at which various media are consumed. Specifically, our business is heavily dependent on the demand for advertising from consumer-focused companies. Dislocation of consumer demand due to changes in commuter volume and patterns and/or hybrid work models has caused, and could further cause, advertisers to reduce, postpone or otherwise change their marketing spending generally, and on our platforms in particular. Such results could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We are continuing to see some of the foregoing effects and could see additional effects in the future from COVID-19 which are not within our control and cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain. The state and condition of the global financial markets and fluctuations in the global and U.S. economies may have an unpredictable impact on our business and financial condition. From time to time, including as a result of inflation, changes in interest rates, recession or the current pandemic, the global equity and credit markets experience high levels of volatility and disruption. At various points in time, the markets have produced upward and/or downward pressure on stock prices and limited credit capacity for certain companies without regard to those companies underlying financial strength. In addition, advertising is a discretionary and variable business expense which may be reduced as companies contend with higher expenses, including higher costs of capital. Spending on advertising tends to decline disproportionately during an economic recession or downturn as compared to other types of business spending. Consequently, a downturn in the United States economy generally has an adverse effect on our advertising revenue and, therefore, our results of operations. A recession or downturn in the economy of any individual geographic market, particularly a major market in which we operate, also may have a significant effect on us. Radio revenues in the markets in which we operate may also face greater challenges than the U.S. economy generally and may remain so. Radio revenues in certain markets in which we operate have lagged the growth of the general United States economy as audiences have not returned to pre-pandemic levels.

 Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry could adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, either directly or through adverse impacts on certain of our vendors and customers. Adverse developments that affect financial institutions, such as events involving liquidity that are rumored or actual, have in the past and may in the future lead to bank failures and/or market-wide liquidity problems. These events could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, either directly or through an adverse impact on certain of our vendors and customers. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC as receiver. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank was put into receivership. Since that time, there have been reports of instability at other U.S. banks. Although the Federal Reserve Board, the Department of the Treasury and the FDIC have taken steps to ensure that depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank can access all of their funds, including funds held in uninsured deposit accounts, and have taken additional steps to provide liquidity to other banks, there is no guarantee that, in the event of the closure of other banks or financial institutions in the future, depositors would be able to access uninsured funds or that they would be able to do so in a timely fashion. To date, we have not experienced any adverse impact to our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations as a result of the events described above. However, failures of other banks or financial institutions may expose us to additional risks, either directly or through the effect on vendors or other third parties, and may lead to significant disruptions to our operations, financial condition and reputation. Moreover, uncertainty remains over liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry. Our business may be adversely impacted by these developments in ways that we cannot predict at this time, there may be additional risks that we have not yet identified, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid negative consequences directly or indirectly from any failure of one or more banks or other financial institutions. Any deterioration in the economy could negatively impact our results of operations. Many financial and economic analysts have forecasted a recession in calendar year 2023 and/or 2024. Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by recession, economic fluctuations, or future economic downturns. Also, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions. Even in the absence of a general recession or downturn in the economy, an individual business sector (such as the automotive industry or the hospitality industry) that tends to spend more on advertising than other sectors might be forced to reduce its advertising expenditures if that sector experiences a downturn. If any such sector s spending represents a significant portion of our advertising revenues, any reduction in its advertising expenditures may affect our revenue. The risks associated with our business could be more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession, which may be accompanied by a decrease in advertising expenditures. A decrease in advertising expenditures could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse impact on our ability to access capital, which could adversely impact our business, ability to make future investments, our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like or need to do so, which could have an adverse impact on our capacity to react to changing economic and business conditions. We are exposed to credit risk on our accounts receivable. This risk is heightened during periods of uncertain economic conditions. Our outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. While we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our receivables, this risk is heightened during periods of uncertain economic conditions and there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk. Such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Increases in interest rates and the reduced availability of financing for consumer products may impact the demand for advertising. In general, demand for certain consumer products may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and the reduced availability of financing. Also, trends in the financial industry which influence the requirements used by lenders 
 24 

Table of Contents 
 to evaluate potential consumers can result in reduced availability of financing. If interest rates or lending requirements increase and consequently, the ability of prospective consumers to finance purchases of products is adversely affected, the demand for advertising may also be adversely impacted and the impact may be material. In addition, our borrowing costs could be impacted, and such cost changes could reduce the expected returns on certain of our corporate development and other investment opportunities. The terms of our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our direct and indirect subsidiaries may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or to take some actions. Our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, incur liens, pay dividends, enter into asset purchase or sale transactions, merge or consolidate with another company, dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or make certain other payments or investments. These restrictions could limit our ability to grow our business through acquisitions and could limit our ability to respond to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs. We have historically incurred net losses which could resume in the future. We have historically reported net losses in our consolidated statements of operations, due mostly in part to recording non-cash impairment charges for write-downs to radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill, interest expenses (both cash and non-cash), and revenue declines caused by weakened advertising demand resulting from the current economic environment. These results have had a negative impact on our financial condition and could be exacerbated in a poor economic climate. If such items recur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Our revenue is substantially dependent on spending and allocation decisions by advertisers, and seasonality and/or weakening economic conditions may have an impact upon our business. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from sales of advertisements and program sponsorships to local and national advertisers. Any reduction in advertising expenditures or changes in advertisers spending priorities and/or allocations across different types of media/platforms or programming could have an adverse effect on the Company s revenues and results of operations. We do not obtain long-term commitments from our advertisers and advertisers may cancel, reduce, or postpone advertisements without penalty, which could adversely affect our revenue. Seasonal net revenue fluctuations are common in the media industries and are due primarily to fluctuations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers. In addition, advertising revenues in even-numbered years tend to benefit from advertising placed by candidates for political offices. The effects of such seasonality (including the weather), combined with the severe structural changes that have occurred in the U.S. economy, make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the previous results of any specific quarter and may adversely affect operating results. Our success is dependent upon audience acceptance of our content, particularly our television and radio programs, which is difficult to predict. Radio, video, and digital content production and distribution are inherently risky businesses because the revenues derived from the production and distribution of media content or a radio program, and the licensing of rights to the intellectual property associated with the content or program, depend primarily upon their acceptance and perceptions by the public, which can change quickly and are difficult to predict. The commercial success of content or a program also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions, and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict. Our failure to obtain or retain rights to popular content on any part of our multi-media platform could adversely affect our revenues. Ratings for broadcast stations and traffic on a particular website are also factors that are weighed when advertisers determine which outlets to use and in determining the advertising rates that the outlet receives. Poor ratings or traffic levels can lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising revenues. For example, if there is an event causing a change of programming at one of our stations, there could be no assurance that any replacement programming would generate the 
 25 

Table of Contents 
 same level of ratings, revenues, or profitability as the previous programming. In addition, changes in ratings methodology, search engine algorithms and technology could adversely impact our businesses and negatively affect our advertising revenues. Television content production is inherently a risky business because the revenues derived from the production and distribution of a television program and the licensing of rights to the associated intellectual property depends primarily upon the public s level of acceptance, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of a television program also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs in the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions, and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict. Rating points are also factors that are weighed when determining the advertising rates that TV One/CLEO TV receive. Poor ratings can lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising revenues. Consequently, low public acceptance of TV One/CLEO TV s content may have an adverse effect on our cable television segment s results of operations. Further, networks or programming launched by Netflix TM , Oprah Winfrey (OWN TM ), Sean Combs (REVOLT TV TM ), and Magic Johnson (ASPIRE TM ), could take away from our audience share and ratings and thus have an adverse effect on our cable television s results of operations. Increases in or new royalties, including through legislation, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We currently pay royalties to song composers and publishers through BMI, ASCAP, SESAC and GMR but not to record labels or recording artists for exhibition or use of over the air broadcasts of music. We must also pay royalties to the copyright owners of sound recordings for the digital audio transmission of such sound recordings on the Internet. We pay such royalties under federal statutory licenses and pay applicable license fees to Sound Exchange, the non-profit organization designated by the United States Copyright Royalty Board to collect such license fees. The royalty rates applicable to sound recordings under federal statutory licenses are subject to adjustment. The royalty rates we pay to copyright owners for the public performance of musical compositions on our radio stations and internet streams could increase as a result of private negotiations and the emergence of new performing rights organizations, which could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, from time to time, Congress considers legislation which could change the copyright fees and the procedures by which the fees are determined. The legislation historically has been the subject of considerable debate and activity by the broadcast industry and other parties affected by the proposed legislation. It cannot be predicted whether any proposed future legislation will become law or what impact it would have on our results from operations, cash flows or financial position. A disproportionate share of our radio segment revenue comes from a small number of geographic markets and our syndicated radio business, Reach Media. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 32.3 of our net revenue was generated from the sale of advertising in our core radio business, excluding Reach Media. Within our core radio business, seven (Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, and Washington, DC) of the 13 markets in which we operated radio stations throughout 2022 or a portion thereof accounted for approximately 73.8 of our radio station net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue from the operations of Reach Media, along with revenue from the seven significant contributing radio markets, accounted for approximately 32.5 of our total consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Adverse events or conditions (economic, including government cutbacks or otherwise) could lead to declines in the contribution of Reach Media or declines in one or more of the seven significant contributing radio markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial performance and results of operations. We may lose audience share and advertising revenue to our competitors. Our media properties compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other radio stations and station groups and other media such as broadcast television, newspapers, magazines, cable television, satellite television, satellite radio, outdoor advertising, over the top providers on the internet and direct mail. Adverse changes in audience ratings, internet traffic, and market shares could have a material adverse effect on our revenue. Larger media companies, with more financial resources than we have may target our core audiences or enter the segments or markets in which we operate, causing competitive pressure. Further, other media and broadcast companies may change their programming format or 
 26 

Table of Contents 
 engage in aggressive promotional campaigns to compete directly with our media properties for our core audiences and advertisers. Competition for our core audiences in any of our segments or markets could result in lower ratings or traffic and, hence, lower advertising revenue for us, or cause us to increase promotion and other expenses and, consequently, lower our earnings and cash flow. Changes in population, demographics, audience tastes and other factors beyond our control, could also cause changes in audience ratings or market share. Failure by us to respond successfully to these changes could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain or increase our current audience ratings and advertising revenue. We must respond to the rapid changes in technology, content offerings, services, and standards across our entire platform in order to remain competitive. Technological standards across our media properties are evolving and new distribution technologies/platforms are emerging at a rapid pace. We cannot assure that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new features, content or services to compete with these new technologies. New media has resulted in fragmentation in the advertising market, and we cannot predict the effect, if any, that additional competition arising from new technologies or content offerings may have across any of our business segments or our financial condition and results of operations, which may be adversely affected if we are not able to adapt successfully to these new media technologies or distribution platforms. The continuing growth and evolution of channels and platforms has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other media platforms. We continually seek to develop and enhance our content offerings and distribution platforms/methodologies. Failure to effectively execute in these efforts, actions by our competitors, or other failures to deliver content effectively could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and, as a result, have adverse effects across our business. The loss of key personnel, including certain on-air talent, could disrupt the management and operations of our business. Our business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key employees, including certain on-air personalities. We believe that the combination of skills and experience possessed by our executive officers and other key employees could be difficult to replace, and that the loss of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us, including the impairment of our ability to execute our business strategy. In addition, several of our on-air personalities and syndicated radio programs hosts have large loyal audiences in their respective broadcast areas and may be significantly responsible for the ratings of a station. The loss of such on-air personalities or any change in their popularity could impact the ability of the station to sell advertising and our ability to derive revenue from syndicating programs hosted by them. We cannot be assured that these individuals will remain with us or will retain their current audiences or ratings. If our digital segment does not continue to develop and offer compelling and differentiated content, products and services, our advertising revenues could be adversely affected. In order to attract consumers and generate increased activity on our digital properties, we believe that we must offer compelling and differentiated content, products and services. However, acquiring, developing, and offering such content, products and services may require significant costs and time to develop, while consumer tastes may be difficult to predict and are subject to rapid change. If we are unable to provide content, products and services that are sufficiently attractive to our digital users, we may not be able to generate the increases in activity necessary to generate increased advertising revenues. In addition, although we have access to certain content provided by our other businesses, we may be required to make substantial payments to license such content. Many of our content arrangements with third parties are non-exclusive, so competitors may be able to offer similar or identical content. If we are not able to acquire or develop compelling content and do so at reasonable prices, or if other companies offer content that is similar to that provided by our digital segment, we may not be able to attract and increase the engagement of digital consumers on our digital properties. Continued growth in our digital business also depends on our ability to continue offering a competitive and distinctive range of advertising products and services for advertisers and publishers and our ability to maintain or increase prices for our advertising products and services. Continuing to develop and improve these products and services may require significant time and costs. If we cannot continue to develop and improve our advertising products and services or if prices 
 27 

Table of Contents 
 for our advertising products and services decrease, our digital advertising revenues could be adversely affected. Finally, recently, our digital business has seen significant growth in its business due to advertisers increased interest in minority controlled media given recent social justice/equality trends. Should these trends reverse or decline, revenues within our digital and other segments could be adversely impacted. More individuals are using devices other than personal and laptop computers to access and use the internet, and, if we cannot make our products and services available and attractive to consumers via these alternative devices, our internet advertising revenues could be adversely affected. Digital users are increasingly accessing and using the internet through mobile tablets, smartphones and wearable devices. In order for consumers to access and use our products and services via these devices, we must ensure that our products and services are technologically compatible with such devices. If we cannot effectively make our products and services available on these devices, fewer internet consumers may access and use our products and services and our advertising revenue may be negatively affected. Unrelated third parties may claim that we infringe on their rights based on the nature and content of information posted on websites we maintain. We host internet services that enable individuals to exchange information, generate content, comment on our content, and engage in various online activities. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the United States and internationally. While we monitor postings to such websites, claims may be brought against us for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information that may be posted online or generated by our users. Our defense of such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources. If we are unable to protect our domain names and/or content, our reputation and brands could be adversely affected. We currently hold various domain name registrations relating to our brands, including urban1.com, radio-one.com and interactiveone.com. The registration and maintenance of domain names are generally regulated by governmental agencies and their designees. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars, or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to register or maintain relevant domain names. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from registering domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brands, and make it more difficult for users to find our websites and our services. In addition, piracy of the Company s content, including digital piracy, may decrease revenue received from the exploitation of the Company s programming and other content and adversely affect its businesses and profitability. Future asset impairment to the carrying values of our FCC licenses and goodwill could adversely impact our results of operations and net worth. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 488.4 million in broadcast licenses and 216.6 million in goodwill, which totaled 705.0 million, and represented approximately 52.7 of our total assets. Therefore, we believe estimating the fair value of goodwill and radio broadcasting licenses is a critical accounting estimate because of the significance of their carrying values in relation to our total assets. We are required to test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which we have traditionally done as of October 1 each year, or on an interim basis when events or changes in circumstances suggest impairment may have occurred. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset over its fair value. Impairment may result from deterioration in our performance, changes in anticipated future cash flows, changes in business plans, adverse economic or market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, or other factors beyond our control. The amount of any impairment must be expensed as a charge to operations. Fair values of FCC licenses have been estimated using the income approach, which incorporates 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 several judgmental assumptions over a 10-year model including, but not limited to, market revenue and projected revenue growth by market, mature market share, mature operating profit margin, discount rate and terminal growth rate. Fair values of goodwill have been estimated using the income approach, which incorporates several judgmental assumptions over a 10-year model including, but not limited to, revenue growth rates, future operating profit margins, discount rate and terminal growth rate. We also utilize a market-based approach to evaluate our fair value estimates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analysis. Changes in certain events or circumstances could result in changes to our estimated fair values and may result in further write-downs to the carrying values of these assets. Additional impairment charges could adversely affect our financial results, financial ratios and could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future. Our business depends on maintaining our licenses with the FCC. We could be prevented from operating a radio station if we fail to maintain its license. Within our core radio business, we are required to maintain radio broadcasting licenses issued by the FCC. These licenses are ordinarily issued for a maximum term of eight years and are renewable. Currently, subject to renewal, our radio broadcasting licenses expire at various times beginning October 2027 through August 1, 2030. While we anticipate receiving renewals of all of our broadcasting licenses, interested third parties may challenge our renewal applications. A station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application was filed and is pending, as is the case with respect to each of our stations with licenses that have expired. During the periods when a renewal application is pending, informal objections and petitions to deny the renewal application can be filed by interested parties, including members of the public, on a variety of grounds. In addition, we are subject to extensive and changing regulation by the FCC with respect to such matters as programming, indecency standards, technical operations, employment and business practices. If we or any of our significant stockholders, officers, or directors violate the FCC s rules and regulations or the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act ), or is convicted of a felony or found to have engaged in certain other types of non-FCC related misconduct, the FCC may commence a proceeding to impose fines or other sanctions upon us. Examples of possible sanctions include the imposition of fines, the renewal of one or more of our broadcasting licenses for a term of fewer than eight years or the revocation of our broadcast licenses. If the FCC were to issue an order denying a license renewal application or revoking a license, we would be required to cease operating the radio station covered by the license only after we had exhausted administrative and judicial review without success. Disruptions or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, compromise client information and expose us to liability, possibly causing our business and reputation to suffer. Our industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data could result in the loss or misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), and general hacking have become more prevalent in general. Our efforts to protect our company s data or the information we receive may be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users data on a continual basis. Any internal technology breach, error or failure impacting systems hosted internally or externally, or any large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on, such as power, telecommunications or the Internet, may disrupt our technology network. Any individual, sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs or reduced revenues. Our technology systems and related data also may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. Our technology security initiatives, disaster recovery plans and other measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial consequences to our reputation.

 In addition, as a part of our ordinary business operations, we may collect and store sensitive data, including personal information of our clients, listeners and employees. The secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored, processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy. Any compromise of our technology systems resulting from attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance could result in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of or access to clients , listeners , employees or business partners information. Any such loss, disclosure, misappropriation or access could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruption of our operations and damage to our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, and to prevent or detect security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security. In the event of a technical or cyber event, we could experience a significant, unplanned disruption, or substantial and extensive degradation of our services, or our network may fail in the future. Despite our significant infrastructure investments, we may have insufficient communications and server capacity to address these or other disruptions, which could result in interruptions in our services. Any widespread interruption or substantial and extensive degradation in the functioning of our IT or technical platform for any reason could negatively impact our revenue and could harm our business and results of operations. If such a widespread interruption occurred, or if we failed to deliver content to users as expected, our reputation could be damaged severely. Moreover, any disruptions, significant degradation, cybersecurity threats, security breaches, or attacks on our internal information technology systems could impact our ratings and cause us to lose listeners, users or viewers or make it more difficult to attract new ones, either of which could harm our business and results of operations. Our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of natural disasters, terrorism or other catastrophic events. Any economic failure or other material disruption caused by war, climate change or natural disasters, including fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes; power loss or shortages; environmental disasters; telecommunications or business information systems failures or similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business. If such disruptions contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on IT, or impair our ability to meet our customer demands, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. There is also an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. In addition to physical risks, climate change risk includes longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as extreme heat, sea level rise, and more frequent and prolonged drought. Such events could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties on which we rely, including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility. The Company s business diversification efforts, including its efforts to expand its gaming investments, are subject to risks and uncertainties. On May 20, 2021, the City of Richmond, Virginia (the City announced that it had selected the Company s wholly-owned unrestricted subsidiary RVA Entertainment Holdings, LLC RVAEH ), as the City s preferred casino gaming operator to develop and operate a casino resort in Richmond Casino Resort ). Pursuant to the Virginia Casino Act, the City is one of five cities in the Commonwealth of Virginia eligible to host a casino gaming establishment, subject to the citizens of the City approving a referendum (the Referendum ). In November 2021, the required Referendum was conducted and failed to pass. On January 24, 2022, the Richmond City Council adopted a new resolution in efforts to bring the ONE Casino + Resort to the City. The new resolution was the first of several steps in pursuit of a second referendum. After the resolution was passed, the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation that sought to delay the second referendum that was anticipated to occur in November 2022. While there was some question as to the applicability of the legislation, RVAEH and the City determined to adhere to the legislation and to seek a second referendum in November 2023. If the voters approve the second referendum then the Commonwealth may issue one license permitting operation of a casino in Richmond. While the path to a second referendum remains, efforts have been made by third parties to move potential grant of the final casino license out of the City and there can be no assurance that a second

Table of Contents 
 referendum will be ordered, pass with the required voter approval or that we will otherwise be able to move forward with the Casino Resort or any similar initiative. As with all corporate development activities the Company may engage in, any of our current and future business diversification efforts, including pursuit of the Casino Resort, are subject to a number of risks, including but not limited to: delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals; changes to plans and/or specifications; lack of sufficient, or delays in the availability of, financing; changes in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and 
 regulations, applicable to gaming, leisure, real estate development or construction projects; availability of qualified contractors and subcontractors; environmental, health and safety issues, including site accidents and the spread of viruses; weather interferences or delays; and other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases. In addition, in engaging in certain of these corporate development activities, we may rely on key contracts and business relationships, and if any of our business partners or contracting counterparties fail to perform, or terminate, any of their contractual arrangements with us for any reason or cease operations, our business could be disrupted and our revenues could be adversely affected. The failure to perform or termination of any of the agreements by a partner or a counterparty, the discontinuation of operations of a partner or counterparty, the loss of good relations with a partner or counterparty or our inability to obtain similar relationships or agreements, may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Our former operating partner, Pacific Peninsula Entertainment, sold substantially all of its assets, including its interest in the ONE Casino + Resort project to Churchill Downs, Incorporated, the owner of the Kentucky Derby. While the Company views this as a positive development for the project, there can be no assurance that this development will not have any negative impact on the development of the project. Certain Regulatory Risks The FCC s media ownership rules could restrict our ability to acquire radio stations. The Communications Act and FCC rules and policies limit the number of broadcasting properties that any person or entity may own (directly or by attribution) in any market and require FCC approval for transfers of control and assignments of licenses. The FCC s media ownership rules remain subject to further agency and court proceedings. As a result of the FCC media ownership rules, the outside media interests of our officers and directors could limit our ability to acquire stations. The filing of petitions or complaints against Urban One or any FCC licensee from which we are acquiring a station could result in the FCC delaying the grant of, refusing to grant or imposing conditions on its consent to the assignment or transfer of control of licenses. The Communications Act and FCC rules and policies also impose limitations on non-U.S. ownership and voting of our capital stock. Enforcement by the FCC of its indecency rules against the broadcast industry could adversely affect our business operations. The FCC s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material on broadcast stations between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent material because of the vagueness of the FCC s indecency and profanity definitions, coupled with the spontaneity of live programming. The FCC has in the past vigorously enforced its indecency rules against the broadcasting industry and has threatened to initiate license revocation proceedings against broadcast licensees for serious indecency violations. In June 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision which, while setting aside certain FCC indecency enforcement actions on narrow due process grounds, declined to rule on the constitutionality of the FCC s indecency policies. Following the 
 31 

Table of Contents 
 Supreme Court s decision, the FCC requested public comment on the appropriate substance and scope of its indecency enforcement policy. It is not possible to predict whether and, if so, how the FCC will revise its indecency enforcement policies or the effect of any such changes on us. The fines for broadcasting indecent material are a maximum of 325,000 per utterance. The determination of whether content is indecent is inherently subjective and, as such, it can be difficult to predict whether particular content could violate indecency standards. The difficulty in predicting whether individual programs, words or phrases may violate the FCC s indecency rules adds significant uncertainty to our ability to comply with the rules. Violation of the indecency rules could lead to sanctions which may adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, third parties could oppose our license renewal applications or applications for consent to acquire broadcast stations on the grounds that we broadcast allegedly indecent programming on our stations. Some policymakers support the extension of the indecency rules that are applicable to over-the-air broadcasters to cover cable programming and/or attempts to increase enforcement of or otherwise expand existing laws and rules. If such an extension, attempt to increase enforcement, or other expansion took place and was found to be constitutional, some of TV One s content could be subject to additional regulation and might not be able to attract the same subscription and viewership levels. Changes in current federal regulations could adversely affect our business operations. Congress and the FCC have considered, and may in the future consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies that could, directly or indirectly, affect the profitability of our broadcast stations. In particular, Congress may consider and adopt a revocation of terrestrial radio s exemption from paying royalties to performing artists and record companies for use of their recordings (radio already pays a royalty to songwriters, composers and publishers). In addition, commercial radio broadcasters and entities representing artists are negotiating agreements that could result in broadcast stations paying royalties to artists. A requirement to pay additional royalties could have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance. Moreover, it is possible that our license fees and negotiating costs associated with obtaining rights to use musical compositions and sound recordings in our programming could sharply increase as a result of private negotiations, one or more regulatory rate-setting processes, or administrative and court decisions. Finally, there has been in the past and there could be again in the future proposed legislation that requires radio broadcasters to pay additional fees such as a spectrum fee for the use of the spectrum. We cannot predict whether such actions will occur. The television and distribution industries in the United States are highly regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. The television broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. The U.S. Congress and the FCC currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operations of our cable television segment. For example, the FCC has initiated a proceeding to examine and potentially regulate more closely embedded advertising such as product placement and product integration. Enhanced restrictions affecting these means of delivering advertising messages may adversely affect our cable television segment s advertising revenues. Changes to the media ownership and other FCC rules may affect the competitive landscape in ways that could increase the competition faced by TV One/CLEO TV. Proposals have also been advanced from time to time before the U.S. Congress and the FCC to extend the program access rules (currently applicable only to those cable program services which also own or are owned by cable distribution systems) to all cable program services. TV One/CLEO TV s ability to obtain the most favorable terms available for its content could be adversely affected should such an extension be enacted into law. We are unable to predict the effect that any such laws, regulations or policies may have on our cable television segment s operations. New or changing federal, state or international privacy regulation or requirements could hinder the growth of our internet business. A variety of federal and state laws govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data that our business uses to operate its services and to deliver certain advertisements to its customers, as well as the technologies used to collect such data. Not only are existing privacy-related laws in these jurisdictions evolving and subject to potentially disparate interpretation by governmental entities, new legislative proposals affecting privacy are now pending at both the federal and state level in the U.S. Further, third-party service providers may from time to time change their privacy requirements. Changes to the interpretation of existing law or the adoption of new privacy-related requirements by governments or other businesses could hinder the growth of our business and cause us to incur new and additional costs and expenses. Also, a failure or perceived failure to comply with such laws or requirements or with our own policies and 
 32 

Table of Contents 
 procedures could result in significant liabilities, including a possible loss of consumer or investor confidence or a loss of customers or advertisers. Unique Risks Related to Our Cable Television Segment The loss of affiliation agreements could materially adversely affect our cable television segment s results of operations. Our cable television segment is dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with cable and direct broadcast distributors for its revenues, and there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed in the future on terms acceptable to such distributors. The loss of one or more of these arrangements could reduce the distribution of TV One s and/or CLEO TV s programming services and reduce revenues from subscriber fees and advertising, as applicable. Further, the loss of favorable packaging, positioning, pricing or other marketing opportunities with any distributor could reduce revenues from subscribers and associated subscriber fees. In addition, consolidation among cable distributors and increased vertical integration of such distributors into the cable or broadcast network business have provided more leverage to these distributors and could adversely affect our cable television segment s ability to maintain or obtain distribution for its network programming on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The results of renewals could have a material adverse effect on our cable television segment s revenues and results and operations. We cannot assure you that TV One and/or CLEO TV will be able to renew their affiliation agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of a significant number of these arrangements or the loss of carriage on basic programming tiers could reduce the distribution of our content, which may adversely affect our revenues from subscriber fees and our ability to sell national and local advertising time. Changes in consumer behavior resulting from new technologies and distribution platforms may impact the performance of our businesses. Our cable television segment faces emerging competition from other providers of digital media, some of which have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. In particular, content offered over the internet has become more prevalent as the speed and quality of broadband networks have improved. Providers such as Netflix TM , Hulu TM , Apple TM , Amazon TM and Google TM , as well as gaming and other consoles such as Microsoft s Xbox TM , Sony s PS5 TM , Nintendo s Wii TM , and Roku TM , are aggressively establishing themselves as alternative providers of video content and services, including new and independently developed long form video content. Most recently, new online distribution services have emerged offering live sports and other content without paying for a traditional cable bundle of channels. These services and the growing availability of online content, coupled with an expanding market for mobile devices and tablets that allow users to view content on an on-demand basis and internet-connected televisions, may impact our cable television segment s distribution for its services and content. Additionally, devices or services that allow users to view television programs away from traditional cable providers or on a time-shifted basis and technologies that enable users to fast-forward or skip programming, including commercials, such as DVRs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of content, have caused changes in consumer behavior that may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues. If we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our cable television segment s target audiences, our business could be adversely affected. Unique Risks Related to Our Capital Structure Our President and Chief Executive Officer has an interest in TV One that may conflict with your interests. Pursuant to the terms of employment with our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Alfred C. Liggins, III, in recognition of Mr. Liggins contributions in founding TV One on our behalf, he is eligible to receive an award amount equal to approximately 4 of any proceeds from distributions or other liquidity events in excess of the return of our aggregate investment in TV One (the Employment Agreement Award ). Our obligation to pay the award was triggered after our recovery of the aggregate amount of capital contribution in TV One, and payment is required only upon actual receipt of distributions of cash or marketable securities or proceeds from a liquidity event in excess of such invested amount. Mr. Liggins rights to the Employment Agreement Award (i) cease if he is terminated for cause or he resigns without good reason and (ii) expire at the termination of his employment (but similar rights could be included in the terms 
 33 

Table of Contents 
 of a new employment agreement or arrangement). As a result of this arrangement, the interest of Mr. Liggins with respect to TV One may conflict with your interests as holders of our debt or equity securities. Two common stockholders have a majority voting interest in Urban One and have the power to control matters on which our common stockholders may vote, and their interests may conflict with yours. As of December 31, 2022, our Chairperson and her son, our President and CEO, together held in excess of 75 of the outstanding voting power of our common stock. As a result, our Chairperson and our CEO control our management and policies and decisions involving or impacting Urban One, including transactions involving a change of control, such as a sale or merger. The interests of these stockholders may differ from the interests of our other stockholders and our debt holders. In addition, certain covenants in our debt instruments require that our Chairperson and the CEO maintain a specified ownership and voting interest in Urban One, and prohibit other parties voting interests from exceeding specified amounts. Our Chairperson and the CEO have agreed to vote their shares together in elections of members to the Board of Directors of Urban One. Further, we are a controlled company under rules governing the listing of our securities on the NASDAQ Stock Market because more than 50 of our voting power is held by our Chairperson and the CEO. Therefore, we are not subject to NASDAQ Stock Market listing rules that would otherwise require us to have: (i) a majority of independent directors on the board; (ii) a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; (iii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors; (iv) compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and (v) director nominees selected, or recommended for the board s selection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors. While a majority of our board members are currently independent directors, we do not make any assurances that a majority of our board members will be independent directors at any given time. We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to our filing status will make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are a smaller reporting company and, thus, have certain decreased disclosure obligations in our SEC filings, including, among other things, simplified executive compensation disclosures and only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects and may make our common stock a less attractive investment. If we fail to meet the continued listing standards of Nasdaq, our common stock may be delisted, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and market price of our common stock and expose the Company to litigation. Our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC NASDAQ has requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed. On April 3, 2023, we were notified that we were not in compliance with requirements of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the Rule as a result of not having timely filed the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (the 2022 Form 10-K ), with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). On May 19, 2023, the Company received a second letter (the Second Nasdaq Letter notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with requirements of the Rule as a result of not having timely filed its 2022 Form 10-K and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2023 (the Q1 2023 Form 10-Q and, together with the 2022 Form 10-K, the Delinquent Reports ), with the SEC. In accordance with the Second Nasdaq Letter, the Company had until June 2, 2023, to submit a plan to file both Delinquent Reports or to submit a plan to regain compliance with respect to these Delinquent Reports. The Company submitted its plan to regain compliance with respect to these Delinquent Reports on May 26, 2023, and on June 5, 2023, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq granting an exception to enable the Company to regain compliance with the Rule. Under the terms of the exception, on or before September 27, 2023, the Company must file its Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2023, as required by the Rule.

 During this time, our common stock will continue to be listed on the NASDAQ, subject to our compliance with other NASDAQ continued listing requirements. If our common stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decrease. In addition, the Delinquent Reports could expose the Company to risk of litigation concerning any impact upon the Company s price of the Company s common stock. Any such litigation could distract management from day-to-day operations and further adversely affect the market price of our common stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES The types of properties required to support each of our radio stations include offices, studios and transmitter/antenna sites. Our other media properties, such as Interactive One, generally only require office space. We typically lease our studio and office space with lease terms ranging from five to 10 years in length. A station s studios are generally housed with its offices in business districts. We generally consider our facilities to be suitable and of adequate size for our current and intended purposes. We lease a majority of our main transmitter/antenna sites and associated broadcast towers and, when negotiating a lease for such sites, we try to obtain a lengthy lease term with options to renew. In general, we do not anticipate difficulties in renewing facility or transmitter/antenna site leases, or in leasing additional space or sites, if required. We own substantially all of our equipment, consisting principally of transmitting antennae, transmitters, studio equipment and general office equipment. The towers, antennae and other transmission equipment used by our stations are generally in good condition, although opportunities to upgrade facilities are periodically reviewed. The tangible personal property owned by us and the real property owned or leased by us are subject to security interests under our senior credit facility. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Urban One is involved from time to time in various routine legal and administrative proceedings and threatened legal and administrative proceedings incidental to the ordinary course of our business. Urban One believes the resolution of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE Not applicable.

Dividends Since first selling our common stock publicly in May 1999, we have not declared any cash dividends on any class of our common stock. We intend to retain future earnings for use in our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash or stock dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, any determination to declare and pay dividends will be made by our Board of Directors in light of our earnings, financial position, capital requirements, contractual restrictions contained in our credit facility and the indentures governing our senior subordinated

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Not required for smaller reporting companies. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following information should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements This Management s Discussion and Analysis MD A has been restated to give effect to the restatement of the Company s consolidated financial statements, as more fully described in Note 2, Restatement of Financial Statements . For further detail regarding the restatement, see Explanatory Note and Item 9A, Controls and Procedures. Overview For the year ended December 31, 2022, consolidated net revenue increased approximately 10.1 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. For 2023, our strategy will be to: (i) grow market share; (ii) improve audience share in certain markets and improve revenue conversion of strong and stable audience share in certain other markets; and (iii) grow and diversify our revenue by successfully executing our multimedia strategy. The impact of the COVID pandemic, including the impact of variants and government interventions that limit normal economic activity, competition from digital audio players, the internet, cable television and satellite radio, among other new media outlets, audio and video streaming on the internet, and consumers increased focus on mobile applications, are some of the reasons our core radio business has experienced volatility. In addition to making overall cutbacks, advertisers continue to shift their advertising budgets away from traditional media such as newspapers, broadcast television and radio to new media outlets. Internet companies have evolved from being large sources of advertising revenue for radio companies to being significant competitors for radio advertising dollars. While these dynamics present significant challenges for companies that are focused solely in the radio industry, through our diversified platform, which includes our radio websites, Interactive One and other online verticals, as well as our cable television business, we are poised to provide advertisers and creators of content with a multifaceted way to reach African-American consumers. Results of Operations Revenue Within our core radio business, we primarily derive revenue from the sale of advertising time and program sponsorships to local and national advertisers on our radio stations. Advertising revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates our radio stations are able to charge, as well as the overall demand for radio advertising time in a market. These rates are largely based upon a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers, the number of radio stations in the related market, and the supply of, and demand for, radio advertising time. Advertising rates are generally highest during morning and afternoon commuting hours. Net revenue consists of gross revenue, net of local and national agency and outside sales representative commissions. Agency and outside sales representative commissions are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing.

In order to maximize cash revenue for our spot inventory, we closely manage the use of trade and barter agreements. Within our digital segment, Interactive One generates the majority of the Company s digital revenue. Our digital revenue is principally derived from advertising services on non-radio station branded, but Company-owned websites. Advertising services include the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements. As the Company runs its advertising campaigns, the customer simultaneously receives benefits as impressions are delivered, and revenue is recognized over time. The amount of revenue recognized each month is based on the number of impressions delivered multiplied by the effective per impression unit price, and is equal to the net amount receivable from the customer.

 Our cable television segment generates the Company s cable television revenue, and derives its revenue principally from advertising and affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue is derived from the sale of television airtime to advertisers and is recognized when the advertisements are run. Our cable television segment also derives revenue from affiliate fees under the terms of various multi-year affiliation agreements generally based on a per subscriber royalty for the right to distribute the Company s programming under the terms of the distribution contracts. Reach Media primarily derives its revenue from the sale of advertising in connection with its syndicated radio shows, including the Rickey Smiley Morning Show, the Russ Parr Morning Show and the DL Hughley Show. Reach Media also operates www.BlackAmericaWeb.com, an African-American targeted news and entertainment website, in addition to providing various other event-related activities. Expenses Our significant expenses are: (i) employee salaries and commissions; (ii) programming expenses; (iii) marketing and promotional expenses; (iv) rental of premises for office facilities and studios; (v) rental of transmission tower space; (vi) music license royalty fees; and (vii) content amortization. We strive to control these expenses by centralizing certain functions such as finance, accounting, legal, human resources and management information systems and, in certain markets, the programming management function. We also use our multiple stations, market presence and purchasing power to negotiate favorable rates with certain vendors and national representative selling agencies. In addition to salaries and commissions, major expenses for our internet business include membership traffic acquisition costs, software product design, post-application software development and maintenance, database and server support costs, the help desk function, data center expenses connected with internet service provider ISP hosting services and other internet content delivery expenses. Major expenses for our cable television business include content acquisition and amortization, sales and marketing. We generally incur marketing and promotional expenses to increase and maintain our audiences. However, because Nielsen reports ratings either monthly or quarterly, depending on the particular market, any changed ratings and the effect on advertising revenue tends to lag behind both the reporting of the ratings and the incurrence of advertising and promotional expenditures.

 Net revenue 

Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2022 2021 (As Restated) 484,604 440,285 44,319 10.1 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized approximately 484.6 million in net revenue compared to approximately 440.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. These amounts are net of agency and outside sales representative commissions. The increase in net revenue was due primarily to increased political advertising revenue, continued mitigation of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic which began in March 2020, and to increased demand for minority focused media. Net revenues from our radio broadcasting segment increased 11.7 from the same period in 2021. Based on reports prepared by the independent accounting firm Miller, Kaplan, Arase Co., LLP Miller Kaplan ), the radio markets we operate in (excluding Richmond and Raleigh, both of which do not participate in Miller Kaplan) increased 6.7 in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, consisting of an increase of 3.8 in local revenues, an increase of 4.6 in national revenues, and an increase of 17.2 in digital revenues. With the exception of our Richmond and Washington DC markets, we experienced net revenue improvements in all of our radio markets, primarily due to higher advertising sales. Same station net revenue for our radio broadcasting segment, excluding political advertising, increased 2.5 compared to the same period in 2021. Net revenue for our Reach Media segment decreased 7.1 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, due primarily to our cruise that sailed during the fourth quarter of 2021 which did not occur in 2022. We recognized approximately 209.9 million from our cable television segment for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to approximately 197.0 million of revenue for the same period in 2021, with the increase due primarily to increased advertising sales. Net revenue from our digital segment increased approximately 18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to stronger direct revenues. Operating expenses Programming and technical, excluding stock-based compensation 

Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2022 2021 122,629 119,072 3,557 3.0 Programming and technical expenses include expenses associated with on-air talent and the management and maintenance of the systems, tower facilities, and studios used in the creation, distribution and broadcast of programming content on our radio stations. Programming and technical expenses for the radio segment also include expenses associated with our programming research activities and music royalties. For our digital segment, programming and technical expenses include software product design, post-application software development and maintenance, database and server support costs, the help desk function, data center expenses connected with ISP hosting services and other internet content delivery expenses. For our cable television segment, programming and technical expenses include expenses associated with technical, programming, production, and content management. The increase in programming and technical expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021 is primarily due to higher expenses in our radio broadcasting, Reach Media and digital segments, which was partially offset by a decrease in expenses at our cable television segment. Our radio broadcasting segment experienced an increase of approximately 2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to higher compensation costs, contract labor, research and software license fees. Our Reach Media segment experienced an increase of 787,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to higher contract labor costs. Our digital segment experienced an increase of approximately 3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to higher compensation expenses, consulting, content expenses and video production costs. Our cable television segment experienced a decrease of approximately 2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to lower content amortization expense.

Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2022 2021 (As Restated) 159,991 141,979 18,012 12.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses include expenses associated with our sales departments, offices and facilities and personnel (outside of our corporate headquarters), marketing and promotional expenses, special events and sponsorships and back office expenses. Expenses to secure ratings data for our radio stations and visitors data for our websites are also included in selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses for the radio broadcasting segment and digital segment include expenses related to the advertising traffic (scheduling and insertion) functions. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include membership traffic acquisition costs for our online business. The increase in expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily due to higher compensation costs, higher employee commissions and national representative fees due to improved revenue and higher promotional expenses and travel and entertainment spending. Our radio broadcasting segment experienced an increase of approximately 8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to higher compensation costs, research and promotional accounts. Our cable television segment experienced an increase of approximately 5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to higher promotional and advertising expenses, compensation costs and research expenses. Our digital segment experienced an increase of approximately 10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher compensation costs, higher traffic acquisition costs and web services fees. Finally, our Reach Media segment experienced a decrease of approximately 6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to our cruise that sailed during the fourth quarter of 2021 which did not occur in 2022.

Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2022 2021 49,985 50,837 (852) (1.7) Corporate expenses consist of expenses associated with our corporate headquarters and facilities, including personnel as well as other corporate overhead functions. There was a decrease in professional fees in 2022 related to corporate development activities in connection with potential gaming and other business development activities, which was partially offset by an increase in compensation costs, software license fees, contract labor, recruiting, and travel and entertainment expenses as employee travel returns to pre-pandemic levels. Stock-based compensation 

Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2022 2021 6,595 565 6,030 1,067.3 The increase in stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, was primarily due to the timing of grants and vesting of stock awards for executive officers and other management personnel.

 Depreciation and amortization expense increased slightly to approximately 10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to approximately 9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to increased depreciation of capital expenditures. Impairment of long-lived assets 

Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2022 2021 (As Restated) 40,683 2,104 38,579 1,833.6 Throughout 2022, there was continued slowing in certain general economic conditions and a rising interest rate environment, which we deemed to be an impairment indicator that warranted interim impairment testing of certain markets radio broadcasting licenses. The impairment of long-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2022 , was related to a non-cash impairment charge of approximately 33.5 million associated with certain of our radio market broadcasting licenses, and approximately 7.2 million related to our Atlanta and Philadelphia market goodwill balances. Interest expense 

Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2022 2021 61,751 65,702 (3,951) (6.0) Interest expense decreased to approximately 61.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to approximately 65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to lower overall debt balances outstanding and lower average interest rates on the Company s debt. On January 25, 2021, the Company closed on a new financing in the form of the 2028 Notes. The proceeds from the 2028 Notes were used to repay in full each of: (i) the 2017 Credit Facility; (ii) the 2018 Credit Facility; (iii) the MGM National Harbor Loan; (iv) the remaining amounts of our 7.375 Notes; and (v) our 8.75 Notes that were issued in the November 2020 Exchange Offer. We entered into a PPP loan arrangement in 2021, and during the year ended December 31, 2022, the PPP loan and related accrued interest was forgiven and recorded as other income in the amount of 7.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased approximately 75.0 million of its 2028 Notes at an average price of approximately 89.5 of par. This reduction in the outstanding debt balances led to a reduction in interest expense. (Gain) loss on retirement of debt 

Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2022 2021 (6,718) 6,949 13,667 196.7 As discussed above, the Company repurchased approximately 75.0 million of its 2028 Notes at an average price of approximately 89.5 of par, resulting in a net gain on retirement of debt of approximately 6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Upon settlement of the 2028 Notes Offering, the 2017 Credit Facility, the 2018 Credit Facility and the MGM National Harbor Loan were terminated and the indentures governing the 7.375 Notes and the 8.75 Notes were satisfied and discharged. There was a net loss on retirement of debt of approximately 6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 associated with the settlement of the 2028 Notes. Other income, net

 the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to our MGM investment. In addition, and as noted above, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the PPP loan and related accrued interest was forgiven and recorded as other income in the amount of 7.6 million. Provision for income taxes 

Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2022 2021 (As Restated) 16,721 13,034 3,687 28.3 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision for income taxes was approximately 16.7 million compared to approximately 13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to higher taxable income and an increase to the Company s effective tax rate during the period. The effective tax rates were 29.5 and 25.0 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 2022 and 2021 annual effective tax rates primarily reflect taxes at statutory tax rates, and the impact of permanent tax adjustments, including non-taxable PPP Loan income forgiveness for the year ended December 31, 2022. Noncontrolling interests in income of subsidiaries 

Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2022 2021 2,626 2,315 311 13.4 The increase in noncontrolling interests in income of subsidiaries was primarily due to higher net income recognized by Reach Media for the year ended December 31, 2022, versus the same period in 2021. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures including broadcast and digital operating income and Adjusted EBITDA as additional means to evaluate our business and operating results through period-to-period comparisons. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included below for review. Reliance should not be placed on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. Measurement of Performance We monitor and evaluate the growth and operational performance of our business using net income and the following key metrics: (a) Net revenue : The performance of an individual radio station or group of radio stations in a particular market is customarily measured by its ability to generate net revenue. Net revenue consists of gross revenue, net of local and national agency and outside sales representative commissions consistent with industry practice. Net revenue is recognized in the period in which advertisements are broadcast. Net revenue also includes advertising aired in exchange for goods and services, which is recorded at fair value, revenue from sponsored events, and other revenue. Net revenue is recognized for our online business as impressions are delivered. Net revenue is recognized for our cable television business as advertisements are run, and during the term of the affiliation agreements at levels appropriate for the most recent subscriber counts reported by the affiliate, net of launch support.
 (b) Broadcast and digital operating income : The radio broadcasting industry commonly refers to station operating income which consists of net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, income taxes, interest expense, interest income, noncontrolling interests in income of subsidiaries, other (income) expense, corporate selling, general and

Table of Contents 
 administrative expenses, stock-based compensation, impairment of long-lived assets and (gain) loss on retirement of debt. However, given the diverse nature of our business, station operating income is not truly reflective of our multi-media operation and, therefore, we use the term broadcast and digital operating income. Broadcast and digital operating income is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). Nevertheless, broadcast and digital operating income is a significant measure used by our management to evaluate the operating performance of our core operating segments. Broadcast and digital operating income provides helpful information about our results of operations, apart from expenses associated with our fixed and long-lived intangible assets, income taxes, investments, impairment charges, debt financings and retirements, corporate overhead and stock-based compensation. Our measure of broadcast and digital operating income is similar to industry use of station operating income; however, it reflects our more diverse business and therefore is not completely analogous to station operating income or other similarly titled measures as used by other companies. Broadcast and digital operating income does not represent operating income or loss, or cash flow from operating activities, as those terms are defined under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to those measurements as an indicator of our performance.
 
 Broadcast and digital operating income increased to approximately 202.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to approximately 179.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately 22.8 million or 12.7 . This increase was due to higher broadcast and digital operating income at each of our segments. Our radio broadcasting segment generated approximately 47.9 million of broadcast and digital operating income during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to approximately 42.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately 5.9 million, primarily due to higher net revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. Reach Media generated approximately 18.9 million of broadcast and digital operating income during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to approximately 17.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower expenses. Our digital segment generated approximately 21.8 million of broadcast and digital operating income during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to approximately 17.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in net revenues, partially offset by increased expenses. Finally, our cable television segment generated approximately 113.4 million of broadcast and digital operating income during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to approximately 103.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, with the increase primarily due to higher net revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. (c) Adjusted EBITDA : Adjusted EBITDA consists of net income (loss) plus (1) depreciation and amortization, income taxes, interest expense, noncontrolling interests in income of subsidiaries, impairment of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation, (gain) loss on retirement of debt, employment agreement and other compensation, contingent consideration from acquisition, corporate development costs, severance-related costs, investment income, less (2) other income and interest income. Net income before interest income, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization is commonly referred to in our business as EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is often a useful measure of a company s operating performance and is a significant measure used by our management to evaluate the operating performance of our business. Accordingly, based on the previous description of Adjusted EBITDA, we believe that it provides useful information about the operating performance of our business, apart from the expenses associated with our fixed assets and long-lived intangible assets or capital structure. Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used as one of the measures for comparing businesses in the broadcasting industry, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including, but not limited to the fact that our definition includes the results of all four of our operating segments (radio broadcasting, Reach Media, digital and cable television). Business activities unrelated to these four segments are included in an all other category which the Company refers to as All other - corporate/eliminations. Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA do not purport to represent operating income or cash flow from operating activities, as those terms are defined under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to those measurements as an indicator of our performance.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and, to the extent necessary, borrowings available under our asset-backed credit facility. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance is approximately 95.4 million as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Current ABL Facility (as defined below). Since early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on certain of our revenue and alternative revenue sources. Most notably, the impacts included a reduction in revenue due to advertisers changing their advertising spend, a change in how people work and commute which affected our overall audience size for broadcast radio, and the postponement of or cancellation of our tent pole special events including impaired or limited ticket sales for such events. In 2022, we have seen revenues begin to recover, particularly in our radio broadcasting segment, aided by the continued economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to the evolving and uncertain nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of new variants, we are not able to estimate the full extent of the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business in the near to medium term. As of December 31, 2022, no amounts were outstanding on our Current ABL Facility (as further defined below). Further, after we refinanced our debt structure in January 2021, we anticipate meeting our debt service requirements and obligations for the foreseeable future, including through one year from the date of issuance of our most recent consolidated financial statements. Our estimates however, remain subject to substantial uncertainty, in particular due to the unpredictable extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the economy generally, the possibility of new variants of the coronavirus and the concentration of certain of our revenues in areas that could be deemed hotspots for the pandemic.

 Credit Rating Agencies On a continuing basis, Standard and Poor s, Moody s Investor Services and other rating agencies may evaluate our indebtedness in order to assign a credit rating. Our corporate credit ratings by Standard Poor s Rating Services and Moody s Investors Service are speculative-grade and have been downgraded and upgraded at various times during the last several years. Any reductions in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs, reduce the availability of financing to us or increase our cost of doing business or otherwise negatively impact our business operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our accounting policies are described in Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies and estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Goodwill and Radio Broadcasting Licenses Goodwill exists whenever the purchase price exceeds the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 488.4 million in broadcast licenses and 216.6 million in goodwill, which totaled 705.0 million, and represented approximately 52.7 of our total assets. The Company accounts for goodwill and broadcasting licenses under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , which requires the Company to test goodwill at the reporting unit level and other indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Our annual impairment testing is performed as of October 1 of each year using an income approach. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow models against available market data by comparing our overall average implied multiple based on our cash flow projections and fair values to recently completed sales transactions for goodwill, and by comparing our estimated fair values to the market capitalization of the Company for both goodwill and broadcasting licenses. The results of these comparisons confirmed that the fair value estimates resulting from our annual assessments in 2022 were reasonable. Impairment exists when the carrying value of these assets exceeds its respective fair value. When the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment amount is charged to operations for the excess. We have 16 reporting units as of our October 2022 annual impairment assessment, consisting of each of the 13 radio markets within the radio segment and each of the other three business segments. Significant impairment charges have been an ongoing trend experienced by media companies in general, and are not unique to us. We believe our estimate of the value of our radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets, and our estimate of the value uses assumptions that incorporate variables based on past experiences and judgments about future operating performance. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and estimates and market factors. The key assumptions associated with determining the estimated fair value for radio broadcasting licenses include market revenue and projected revenue growth by market, mature market share, mature operating profit margin, terminal growth rate, and 
 51 

Table of Contents 
 discount rate. The key assumptions associated with determining the estimated fair value for goodwill include revenue growth rates of each radio market, future operating profit margins, terminal growth rate, and the discount rate. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values, changes in any one estimate, assumption or a combination of estimates and assumptions, or changes in certain events or circumstances (including uncontrollable events and circumstances resulting from continued deterioration in the economy or credit markets) could require us to assess recoverability of broadcasting licenses and goodwill at times other than our annual October 1 assessments, and could result in changes to our estimated fair values and further write-downs to the carrying values of these assets. Impairment charges are non-cash in nature, and as with current and past impairment charges, any future impairment charges will not impact our cash needs or liquidity or our bank ratio covenant compliance. We had a total goodwill carrying value of approximately 216.6 million across 10 of our 16 reporting units as of December 31, 2022. The below table indicates the terminal growth rates assumed in our impairment testing and the terminal growth/decline rates that would result in additional goodwill impairment. However, should our estimates and assumptions for assessing the fair values of the remaining reporting units with goodwill worsen to reflect the below or lower terminal growth/decline rates, additional goodwill impairments may be warranted in the future. For three of the reporting units, we used a step zero qualitative analysis and therefore those reporting units are not included in the table below. 

Terminal Growth/(Decline) Rate Terminal That Would Result in Growth Rate Carrying Value that is less Reporting Unit Used than Fair Value (a) 2 0.5 Impairment not likely 16 0.7 Impairment not likely 1 0.8 (0.8) 11 0.6 (2.4) 13 0.5 (3.3) 10 0.8 (6.8) 6 0.6 (13.8) (a) The terminal growth/(decline) rate that would result in the carrying value of the reporting unit being less than the fair value of the reporting unit applies only to further goodwill impairment and not to any future license impairment that would result from lowering the terminal growth rates used. 
 We had a total radio broadcasting licenses carrying value of approximately 488.4 million across 13 of our 16 reporting units as of December 31, 2022. Several of the licenses in our units of accounting have limited or no excess of fair values over their respective carrying values. As set forth in the table below, as of October 1, 2022, which is the Company s annual impairment assessment date, we appraised the radio broadcasting licenses at a fair value of approximately 562.8 million, which was in excess of the 488.4 million carrying value by 74.4 million, or 15.2 . The fair values of the licenses exceeded the carrying values of the licenses for all units of accounting. Should our estimates, 
 52 

Table of Contents 
 assumptions, or events or circumstances for any upcoming valuations worsen in the units with no or limited fair value cushion, additional license impairments may be needed in the future.

 See Note 6 Goodwill, Radio Broadcasting Licenses and Other Intangible Assets , of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Impairment of Intangible Assets Excluding Goodwill, Radio Broadcasting Licenses and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Intangible assets, excluding goodwill, radio broadcasting licenses and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be fully recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration of operating results, changes in business plans, or changes in anticipated future cash flows. If an impairment indicator is present, we will evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups. If the assets are impaired, the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets determined by estimates of discounted cash flows. The discount rate used in any estimate of discounted cash flows would be the rate required for a similar investment of like risk. The Company reviewed certain intangibles for impairment during 2022 and 2021 and determined no impairment charges were necessary. Any changes in the valuation estimates and assumptions or changes in certain events or circumstances could result in changes to the estimated fair values of these intangible assets and may result in future write-downs to the carrying values. Income Taxes To address the exposures of uncertain tax positions, we recognize the impact of a tax position in the financial statements if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained on examination based on the technical merits of the position. As of December 31, 2022, we had 688,000 in unrecognized tax benefits. Future outcomes of our tax positions may be more or less than the currently recorded liability, which could result in recording additional taxes, or reversing some portion of the liability and recognizing a tax benefit once it is determined the liability is no longer necessary as potential issues get resolved, or as statutes of limitations in various tax jurisdictions close. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its conclusions regarding the future realization of the Company s deferred tax assets DTAs ). During the year ended December 31, 2022, management continues to believe that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not the DTAs are realizable. The assessment to determine the value of the DTAs to be realized under ASC 740 is highly judgmental and requires the consideration of all available positive and negative evidence in evaluating the likelihood of realizing the tax benefit of the DTAs in a future period. Circumstances may change over time such that previous negative evidence no longer exists, and new conditions should be evaluated as positive or negative evidence that could affect the realization of the DTAs. Since the evaluation requires consideration of events that may occur some years into the future, significant judgment is required, and our conclusion could be materially different if certain expectations do not materialize. As of the year ended December 31, 2022, management continues to weigh the objectively verifiable evidence associated with its cumulative income or loss position over the most recent three-year period. The Company continues to maintain three years of rolling cumulative income since the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Management also considered the cumulative income includes non-deductible pre-tax expenditures that, while included in pre-tax earnings, are not a component of taxable income and therefore are not expected to negatively impact the Company s ability to realize the tax benefit of the DTAs in current or future years. As part of the 2017 Tax Act, IRC Section 163(j) limits the timing of the tax deduction for interest expense. In conjunction with evaluating and weighing the aforementioned negative and positive evidence from the Company s historical cumulative income or loss position, management also evaluated the impact that interest expense has had on our cumulative income or loss position over the most recent three-year period. A material component of the Company s expenses is interest and has been the primary driver of historical pre-tax losses. As part of our evaluation of positive evidence, management is adjusting for the IRC Section 163(j) interest expense limitation on projected taxable income as 
 54 

Table of Contents 
 part of developing forecasts of taxable income sufficient to utilize the Company s federal and state net operating losses that are not subject to annual limitation resulting from the 2009 ownership shift as defined under IRC Section 382. Realization of the Company s DTAs is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods, and although management believes it is more likely than not future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the DTAs, realization is not assured and future events may cause a change to the judgment of the realizability of the DTAs. If a future event causes management to re-evaluate and conclude that it is not more likely than not, that all or a portion of the DTAs are realizable, the Company would be required to establish a valuation allowance against the assets at that time, which would result in a charge to income tax expense and a decrease to net income in the period which the change of judgment is concluded. The Company continues to assess potential tax strategies, which if successful, may reduce the impact of the annual limitations and potentially recover NOLs that otherwise would expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities. If successful, the Company may be able to recover additional federal and state NOLs in future periods, which could be material. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize additional federal and state NOLs, the tax benefit could materially impact future quarterly and annual periods. The federal and state NOLs expire in various years from 2023 to 2039. Fair Value Measurements Prior to and as of the period ended September 30, 2022, the Company accounted for its MGM Investment at cost less impairment under ASC 321, Investments Equity Securities ASC 321 ). In connection with the preparation of its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company identified that the MGM Investment should have been classified as an available-for-sale debt security in accordance with ASC 320, Investments Debt Securities ASC 320 ). As a result, the Company has made adjustments to correct this error. Refer to Note 2 - Restatement of Financial Statements for further details. The MGM Investment is preferred stock that has a non-transferable put right and is classified as an available-for-sale debt security. For the periods restated, the Company considered two models: the dividend discount model and the contractual valuation approach. The Company evaluated the appropriateness of each valuation technique as of each reporting period and ultimately determined that the dividend discount model should be utilized for the periods from the fourth quarter of 2020 up until the third quarter of 2022, based on the facts, circumstances, and information available at the time. The Company estimates the fair value, which is considered to be a Level 3 measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs. Significant inputs to the dividend discount model include revenue growth rates, discount rate and a terminal growth rate. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company determined that the contractual valuation approach should be utilized, as it believes this more closely approximates the fair value of the investment at that time. This method relies on a contractually agreed upon formula established between the Company and MGM National Harbor as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of MGM National Harbor, LLC the Agreement ), rather than market-based inputs or traditional valuation methods. As defined in the Agreement, the calculation of the put is based on operating results, Enterprise Value and the Put Price Multiple. The inputs used in this measurement technique are specific to the entity, MGM National Harbor, and there are no current observable prices for investments in private companies that are comparable to MGM National Harbor. The inputs used to measure the fair value of this security are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company accounts for an award called for in the CEO s employment agreement (the Employment Agreement at fair value. According to the Employment Agreement, executed in April 2008, the CEO is eligible to receive an award (the Employment Agreement Award in an amount equal to approximately 4 of any proceeds from distributions or other liquidity events in excess of the return of the Company s aggregate investment in TV One. The Company s obligation to pay the award was triggered after the Company recovered the aggregate amount of capital contributions in TV One, and payment is required only upon actual receipt of distributions of cash or marketable securities or proceeds from a liquidity event with respect to such invested amount. The long-term portion of the award is recorded in other long-term liabilities and the current portion is recorded in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The CEO was fully vested in the award upon execution of the Employment Agreement, and the award lapses if the CEO voluntarily leaves the Company or is terminated for cause. In September 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the 
 55 

Table of Contents 
 Company approved terms for a new employment agreement with the CEO, including a renewal of the Employment Agreement Award upon similar terms as in the prior Employment Agreement. The Company estimated the fair value of the Employment Agreement Award as of December 31, 2022, at approximately 26.3 million and, accordingly, adjusted the liability to that amount. The fair value estimate incorporated a number of assumptions and estimates, including but not limited to TV One s future financial projections. As the Company will measure changes in the fair value of this award at each reporting period as warranted by certain circumstances, different estimates or assumptions may result in a change to the fair value of the award amount previously recorded. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are interests in subsidiaries that are redeemable outside of the Company s control either for cash or other assets. These interests are classified as mezzanine equity and measured at the greater of estimated redemption value at the end of each reporting period or the historical cost basis of the noncontrolling interests adjusted for cumulative earnings allocations. The resulting increases or decreases in the estimated redemption amount are affected by corresponding charges against retained earnings, or in the absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in-capital. The Company assesses the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Reach Media as of the end of each reporting period. The fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, was approximately 25.3 million and 18.7 million, respectively. The determination of fair value incorporated a number of assumptions and estimates including, but not limited to, revenue growth rates, future operating profit margins, discount rate and a terminal growth rate. Different estimates and assumptions may result in a change to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests amount previously recorded. Content Assets Our cable television segment has entered into contracts to license entertainment programming rights and programs from distributors and producers. The license periods granted in these contracts generally run from one year to five years. Contract payments are typically made in quarterly installments over the terms of the contract period. Each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to its gross contractual commitment when the license period begins, and the program is available for its first airing. The Company also has programming for which the Company has engaged third parties to develop and produce, and it owns most or all rights (commissioned programming). For programming that is predominantly monetized as part of a content group, such as the Company s commissioned programs, capitalized costs are amortized based on an estimate of our usage and benefit from such programming. The estimates require management s judgement and include consideration of factors such as expected revenues to be derived from the programming and the expected number of future airings, among other factors. The Company s acquired programs capitalized costs are amortized based on projected usage, generally resulting in a straight-line amortization pattern. The Company utilizes judgment and prepares analyses to determine the amortization patterns of our content assets. Key assumptions include the categorization of content based on shared characteristics and the use of a quantitative model to predict revenue. For each film group, which the Company defines as a genre, this model takes into account projected viewership which is based on (i) estimated household universe; (ii) ratings; and (iii) expected number of airings across different broadcast time slots. Management regularly reviews, and revises, when necessary, its total revenue estimates, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write down of the asset to fair value. The result of the content amortization analysis is either an accelerated method or a straight-line amortization method over the estimated useful lives of generally one to five years. Content that is predominantly monetized within a film group is assessed for impairment at the film group level and is tested for impairment if circumstances indicate that the fair value of the content within the film group is less than its unamortized costs. The Company s film groups for commission programming are generally aligned along genre, while the Company s licensed content is considered a separate film group. The Company evaluates the fair value of content at the group level by considering expected future revenue generation using a cash flow analysis when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized costs. Estimates of future revenues consider historical airing patterns and future plans for airing content, 
 56 

Table of Contents 
 including any changes in strategy. Given the significant estimates and judgments involved, actual demand or market conditions may be less favorable than those projected, requiring a write-down to fair value. The Company determined there were no impairment indicators evident during the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an impairment and additional amortization expense of 695,000, as a result of evaluating its contracts for impairment. Impairment and amortization of content assets is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as programming and technical expenses. All commissioned and licensed content is classified as a long-term asset, except for the portion of the unamortized content balance that is expected to be amortized within one year which is classified as a current asset. Tax incentives that state and local governments offer that are directly measured based on production activities are recorded as reductions in production costs. Capital and Commercial Commitments Indebtedness As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 750.0 million of our 2028 Notes outstanding within our corporate structure. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2028 Notes, together with cash on hand, to repay or redeem: (i) the 2017 Credit Facility; (ii) the 2018 Credit Facility; (iii) the MGM National Harbor Loan; (iv) the remaining amounts of our 7.375 Notes; and (v) our 8.75 Notes that were issued in the November 2020 Exchange Offer. Upon settlement of the 2028 Notes, the 2017 Credit Facility, the 2018 Credit Facility and the MGM National Harbor Loan were terminated and the indentures governing the 7.375 Notes and the 8.75 Notes were satisfied and discharged. See Liquidity and Capital Resources . See the balances outstanding as of December 31, 2022 in the Type of Debt section as part of the Liquidity and Capital Resources section above. Lease Obligations We have non-cancelable operating leases for office space, studio space, broadcast towers and transmitter facilities that expire over the next nine years. Operating Contracts and Agreements We have other operating contracts and agreements including employment contracts, on-air talent contracts, severance obligations, retention bonuses, consulting agreements, equipment rental agreements, programming related agreements, and other general operating agreements that expire over the next five years. Royalty Agreements Musical works rights holders, generally songwriters and music publishers, have been traditionally represented by performing rights organizations, such as the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ASCAP ), Broadcast Music, Inc. BMI and SESAC, Inc. SESAC ). The market for rights relating to musical works is changing rapidly. Songwriters and music publishers have withdrawn from the traditional performing rights organizations, particularly ASCAP and BMI, and new entities, such as Global Music Rights, Inc. GMR ), have been formed to represent rights holders. These organizations negotiate fees with copyright users, collect royalties and distribute them to the rights holders. We currently have arrangements with ASCAP, SESAC and GMR. On April 22, 2020, the Radio Music License Committee RMLC ), an industry group which the Company is a part of, and BMI reached agreement on the terms of a new license agreement that covers the period January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2021. Upon approval of the court of the BMI/RMLC agreement, the Company automatically became a party to the agreement and to a license with BMI through December 31, 2021. On April 12, 2022, the RMLC announced that it had reached an interim licensing agreement with BMI. The radio industry s previous agreement with BMI covering calendar years 2017 to 2021 expired December 31, 2021 (the 2017 Licensing Terms ), but the interim arrangement will keep the 2017 Licensing Terms in place until a new arrangement is agreed upon. The Company is party to the interim arrangement and, therefore, will continue to operate under the 2017 Licensing Terms. On February 7, 2022, the RMLC and GMR reached a settlement and achieved certain

 conditions which effectuate a four-year license to which the Company is a party for the period April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2026. The license includes an optional three-year extended term that the Company may effectuate prior to the end of the initial term. Reach Media Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Beginning on January 1, 2018, the noncontrolling interest shareholders of Reach Media have had an annual right to require Reach Media to purchase all or a portion of their shares at the then current fair market value for such shares (the Put Right ). This annual right is exercisable for a 30-day period beginning January 1 of each year. The purchase price for such shares may be paid in cash and/or registered Class D common stock of Urban One, at the discretion of Urban One.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Not required for smaller reporting companies. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The consolidated financial statements of Urban One required by this item are filed with this report on Pages F-1 to F-74. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and the Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching our desired disclosure controls objectives. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in our periodic SEC reports due to the material weaknesses discussed below. (b) Management s report on internal control over financial reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management determined that the Company had the following material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022: 
 59 

Table of Contents 
 Control Environment, Risk Assessment, and Monitoring We did not have appropriately designed entity-level controls impacting the (1) control environment, (2) risk assessment procedures, and (3) monitoring activities to prevent or detect material misstatements to the financial statements and assess whether the components of internal control were present and functioning. These deficiencies were attributed to an insufficient number of qualified resources to effectively operate and oversee internal controls over financial reporting. Control Activities Management has determined that the Company did not have adequate selection and development of effective control activities resulting in the following material weaknesses: Management did not design and maintain effective information technology general controls in the areas of user access and program change management for certain information technology systems that support the Company s financial reporting and other processes. This material weakness also resulted in segregation of duties conflicts for certain user roles. Management did not design and maintain effective controls to support proper segregation of duties relating to the review of manual journal entries. Management did not design and maintain effective review controls over revenue, income taxes, content assets, launch assets, the preparation of the statements of cash flows, and certain financial statement disclosures with an appropriate level of precision to detect a material misstatement. Management did not design and maintain effective review controls over the accounting and disclosures related to the investment in MGM National Harbor. This material weakness resulted in a restatement as disclosed in Note 2 and Note 17 to the annual financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2022. As previously reported, management did not design and maintain effective controls over the completeness and accuracy of the balances of its radio broadcasting licenses, goodwill and related accounts. Specifically, the Company s monitoring and control activities related to review of key third-party reports and assumptions used in the valuation of its radio broadcasting licenses, goodwill and related accounts were not operating effectively. 
 The Company s independent registered public accounting firm is engaged to express an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in its report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K under the caption Reports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. Plans for Remediation Management is committed to the remediation of the material weaknesses described above, as well as the continued improvement of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Management has implemented and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented and operating effectively. Specifically, we are: Hiring additional accounting personnel and implementing training of new and existing personnel on proper execution of designed control procedures; Engaging external resources with the appropriate depth of expertise to support the redesign of certain control procedures; Designing, implementing and documenting enhanced controls, policies, and procedures with an appropriate level of precision to detect a material misstatement, and to retain sufficient documentation to support the operating effectiveness of the controls. Our control enhancement procedures will include:

Table of Contents 
 o Modifying our journal entry process and system role configuration to establish a formal hierarchy of review of journal entries in order to enforce proper segregation of duties; o increasing the precision and specificity of our control activities, addressing completeness and accuracy of the information used in performing management review controls, as well as documenting sufficient evidence of management s review supporting its conclusions; and o redesigning information technology general controls across in-scope systems related to user access and change management. Management will design and test the operating effectiveness of the newly implemented controls in future periods. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. (c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting Except for the material weaknesses described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Controlled Company Exemption We are a controlled company within the meaning of Rule 5615(c)(1) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules, because more than 50 of our voting power is held by Catherine L. Hughes, our Chairperson of the Board and Secretary, and Alfred C. Liggins, III, our CEO and President. See Security Ownership of Beneficial Owners and Management below . Therefore, we are not subject to NASDAQ Stock Market listing rules that would otherwise require us to have: (i) a majority of independent directors on the board; (ii) a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; (iii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors; (iv) compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and (v) director nominees selected, or recommended for the board s selection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors. Board Leadership Structure Ms. Hughes has been Chairperson of the Board of Directors since 1980. Since the appointment of Mr. Liggins as CEO in 1997, the roles of Chairperson of the Board and CEO have been separate. We believe it is the CEO s responsibility to run the Company and the Chairperson s responsibility to run the Board of Directors. By having Ms. Hughes serve as Chairperson of the Board, Mr. Liggins is better able to focus on running the day-to-day operations of the Company. Bifurcating the roles enables non-management Directors to raise issues and concerns for Board consideration without immediately involving the CEO. The Chairperson or lead Director also serves as a liaison between the Board and senior management and also provides further vision as to the strategic direction of the Company. Finally, the Board has a third leadership position in the Chairmen of our Audit Committee. As discussed below, our Audit Committee is comprised of three independent directors. The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing, and reporting practices of Urban One and for the Company s risk management. The Chair of the 
 63 

Table of Contents 
 Audit Committee effectively serves as a check on both the Chairperson and the CEO by representing a strong outside presence with significant financial and business experience. The Board of Directors believes that the appropriate leadership structure should be based on the needs and circumstances of the Board, the Company and its stockholders at a given point in time, and that the Board should remain adaptable to shaping the leadership structure as those needs change in the future. Communication with the Board Our stockholders may communicate directly with the Board of Directors. All communications should be in written form and directed to Urban One s Assistant Secretary at the following address: Assistant Secretary Urban One, Inc. 1010 Wayne Avenue, 14th Floor Silver Spring, Maryland 20910 Communications should be enclosed in a sealed envelope that prominently indicates that it is intended for Urban One s Board of Directors. Each communication intended for Urban One s Board of Directors and received by the Assistant Secretary that is related to the operation of Urban One and is relevant to the director s service on the board shall be forwarded to the specified party following its clearance through normal review and appropriate security procedures. Committees of the Board of Directors The board has a standing audit committee, compensation committee and nominating committee. Audit Committee The audit committee consists of D. Geoffrey Armstrong, Brian W. McNeill, Terry L. Jones, and B. Doyle Mitchell, each of whom satisfies the requirements for audit committee membership under the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market. Each of the audit committee members is an independent director, as that term is defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules. The Board of Directors has determined that each of Mr. Armstrong, Mr. McNeill, Mr. Jones, and Mr. Mitchell qualify as audit committee financial experts, as defined by Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933. The board has adopted a written audit committee charter, which is available on our website at https://urban1.com/urban-one-investor-relations/. The audit committee met five times during the calendar year ended December 31, 2022, and acted once time by written consent. The audit committee is responsible for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing, and reporting practices of Urban One, and as part of this responsibility the audit committee: selects our independent registered public accounting firm; reviews the services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm, including non-audit services, if any; reviews the scope and results of the annual audit; reviews the adequacy of the system of internal accounting controls and internal control over financial reporting; reviews and discusses the financial statements and accounting policies with management and our independent registered public accounting firm;

Compensation Committee Our compensation committee consists of Terry L. Jones, Brian W. McNeill, D. Geoffrey Armstrong, and B. Doyle Mitchell. The compensation committee met onetime during the calendar year ended December 31, 2022, and acted once by written consent. The board has adopted a revised written compensation committee charter. The functions of the compensation committee include: reviewing and approving the salaries, bonuses, and other compensation of our executive officers, including stock options or restricted stock grants; establishing and reviewing policies regarding executive officer compensation and perquisites; and performing such other duties as shall from time to time be delegated by the board. 
 Nominating Committee Our nominating committee consists of Alfred C. Liggins, III, Catherine L. Hughes, Terry L. Jones, and Brian W. McNeill. The nominating committee is responsible for recommending the criteria for selection of board members and assisting the board in identifying candidates. The nominating committee acted once by written consent during the calendar year ended December 31, 2022. The nominating committee does not have a charter. The nominating committee reviews the qualifications of all persons recommended by stockholders as nominees to the Board of Directors to determine whether the recommended nominees will make good candidates for consideration for membership on the board. The nominating committee has not established specific minimum qualifications for recommended nominees. However, as a matter of practice, the nominating committee evaluates recommended nominees for directors based on their integrity, judgment, independence, financial and business acumen, relevant experience, and their ability to act on behalf of all stockholders, as well as meet the needs of the Board of Directors, including the need to have a diversity of perspective. In the consideration of diversity of perspective, the nominating committee is most concerned with finding nominees that counter any perceived weaknesses in board composition. Such weaknesses may include weaknesses in perspective based upon race, sex, gender identification, skill sets and industry insight particularly as the Company diversifies its business. Following such evaluation, the nominating committee will make recommendations for director membership and review the recommendations with the Board of Directors, which will decide whether to invite the candidate to be a nominee for election to the board. Nominees are not discriminated against on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability, or any other basis proscribed by law. The nominating committee recommended to the board that the incumbent directors, be nominated for re-election to the board at the 2023 annual meeting. Code of Ethics We have adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees and meets the requirements of the rules of the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market. The code of ethics is available on our website, www.urban1.com ,

 SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires Radio One s directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our common stock to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC reports showing ownership and changes in ownership of our common stock and other equity securities. On the basis of reports and representations submitted by Radio One s directors, executive officers, and greater than ten percent owners, we believe that all required Section 16(a) filings for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, were timely made. ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Compensation Policies and Philosophy The overall objective of our compensation to our executives is to attract, motivate, retain, and reward the top-quality management that we need to operate successfully and meet our strategic objectives, including our diversification into a broader multi-media company. To achieve this, we aim to provide a performance-based compensation package that is competitive in the markets and industries in which we compete for talent, provides rewards for achieving financial, operational, and strategic performance goals, and aligns executives financial interests with those of our shareholders. We operate in the intensely competitive media industry, which is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent introduction of new media services, price and cost competition, limited advertising dollars, and extensive regulation. We face many aggressive and well-financed competitors. In this environment, our success depends on attracting and maintaining a leadership team with the integrity, skills, and dedication needed to manage a dynamic organization and the vision to anticipate and respond to future market developments. We use our executive compensation program to help us achieve this objective. Part of the compensation package is designed to enable us to assemble and retain a group of executives who have the collective and individual abilities necessary to run our business to meet these challenges. Other parts are intended to focus these executives on achieving financial results that enhance the value of our stockholders investment. At the same time, the compensation structure is flexible, so that we can meet the changing needs of our business over time and reward executive officers and managers based on the financial performance of operations under their control. Process Our compensation committee meets periodically throughout the year. In addition, members of the compensation committee discuss compensation matters with our CEO and CFO and among themselves informally outside of meetings. In establishing the compensation levels for Radio One s executive officers, the compensation committee considers a number of qualitative and quantitative factors, including the competitive market for executives, the level and types of compensation paid to executive officers in similar positions by comparable companies, and an evaluation of Radio One s financial and operational performance. We review the compensation paid to executives at other comparable media companies as a reference point for determining the competitiveness of our executive compensation. Our peer group of radio broadcasting companies includes Citadel Broadcasting Corporation, Cox Radio, Inc., Emmis Communications Corp., Audacy Communications Corp., and Saga Communications Inc. In addition, given the diversity of our business, the compensation committee may review the compensation practices at companies with which it competes for talent, including television, cable, film, online, software and other publicly held businesses with a scope and complexity like ours. The compensation committee does not attempt to set each compensation element for any executive within a particular range related to levels provided by peers. Instead, the compensation committee uses market comparison as one factor in making compensation decisions. Other factors considered when making individual executive compensation decisions include individual contribution and performance, reporting structure, internal pay relationship, complexity and importance of roles and responsibilities, leadership, and growth potential. Our CEO provides input into the compensation discussion and makes recommendations to the compensation committee for annual compensation changes and bonuses for the executive officers and the appropriateness of additional

 long-term incentive compensation. The compensation committee has retained and actively consults with a benefits consulting firm to assist with setting compensation for our executives. Principal Components of Executive Compensation We seek to achieve our compensation philosophy through three key compensation elements: base salary; a performance-based annual bonus (that constitutes the short-term incentive element of our program), which may be paid in cash, restricted stock units, shares of stock or a combination of these; and grants of long-term, equity-based compensation (that constitute the long-term incentive element of our program), such as stock options and/or restricted stock units, which may be subject to time-based and/or performance-based vesting requirements. The compensation committee believes that this three-part approach is consistent with programs adopted by similarly situated companies and best serves the interests of our stockholders. The approach enables us to meet the requirements of the competitive environment in which we operate, while ensuring that executive officers are compensated in a manner that advances both the short and long-term interests of our stockholders. Under this approach, compensation for our executive officers involves a high proportion of pay that is at risk, namely, the annual bonus and the value of stock options and restricted stock units. Stock options and/or restricted stock units relate a sizable portion of each executive s long-term remuneration directly to the stock price appreciation realized by our stockholders. The compensation committee may award stock options or grant restricted stock to any executive officer or other eligible participants under the Plan, on its own initiative or at the recommendation of management. In accordance with our Stock Plan Administration Procedures, as approved by the compensation committee, the grant date for grants approved by the compensation committee to executive officers (other than a companywide grants) is the next monthly grant date immediately following the meeting of the compensation committee. Monthly grant dates are generally the fifth day of each month, or the next NASDAQ trading day in the event the fifth day is not a business day. However, it is also our practice in granting options to executive officers to wait for the release of any material non-public information and settlement of that information in the marketplace.

Other Benefits and Perquisites As part of our competitive compensation package to attract and retain talented employees, we offer retirement, health, and other benefits to our employees. Our named executive officers participate in the same benefit plans as our other salaried employees. The only benefit programs offered to our named executive officers either exclusively or with terms different from those offered to other eligible employees are the following: Deferred Compensation. We had a deferred compensation plan that allowed Catherine L. Hughes, our Chairperson, to defer compensation on a voluntary, non-tax qualified basis. The plan was terminated in 2017, and as such Ms. Hughes did not defer any of her compensation during the year ended December 31, 2022. The amount owed to her as deferred compensation for prior years is an unfunded and unsecured general obligation of our Company. Deferred amounts accrue interest based upon the return earned on an investment account with a designated brokerage firm established by Urban One. All deferred amounts are payable in a lump sum 30 days after the date of the event causing the distribution to be paid. No named executive officer earns above-market or preferential earnings on nonqualified deferred compensation. Other Perquisites. We provide few perquisites to our named executive officers. Currently, we provide or reimburse executives for a company automobile, driver and various administrative services including a financial manager and a personal assistant. We have set forth the incremental cost of providing these benefits and perquisites to our named executives in the 2022 Summary Compensation Table in the All Other Compensation column. 401(k) Plan The Company has a defined contribution 401(k) savings and retirement plan. In calendar year 2022, participants could contribute up to 20,500 of their gross compensation, subject to certain limitations. In calendar year 2021, participants could contribute up to 19,500 of their gross compensation, subject to certain limitations. Employees ages 50 or older could make an additional catch-up contribution of in each of calendar years 2022 and 2021 up to 6,500 of their gross compensation. The Company currently does not offer any matching component with respect to its 401(k) savings and retirement plan. Tax Deductibility of Executive Compensation Section 162(m) of the Code imposes limitations upon the federal income tax deductibility of certain compensation paid to our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and to each of our other highly compensated executive officers. Under these limitations, we may deduct such compensation only to the extent that during any year the compensation paid to any such officer does not exceed 1,000,000 or meets certain limited conditions. The compensation committee believes that it is in our best interests to retain flexibility and discretion to make compensation awards to foster achievement of goals the Committee deems important to our success, including for example encouraging employee retention, rewarding achievement of non- quantifiable goals, and achieving progress with specific projects. Our compensation committee may also take accounting considerations, including the impact of Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 718, into account in structuring compensation programs and determining the form and amount of compensation awarded.

An award in the amount of 4,038,131 and 3,572,968 was paid in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, for 2022 and 2021, the Company provided financial services and administrative support to Mr. Liggins in the amounts of 166,724 and 111,413, respectively. Pay Versus Performance As required by new pay versus performance PVP rules adopted by the SEC in August 2022 and in effect for the first time for this proxy statement, the following Pay Versus Performance table PVP Table provides required information about compensation for our named executive officers for the periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 (each of 2021 and 2022, a Covered Year ). We refer to all the named executive officers covered in the PVP Table below, collectively, as the PVP NEOs. The PVP Table also provides information about the results for certain measures of financial performance during those same Covered Years. In reviewing this information, we believe you should consider: 

The information in columns (b) and (d) of the PVP Table comes directly from this year s Summary Compensation Table (or last year s Summary Compensation Table), without adjustment, calculated in the manner as required under SEC rules for such table; 

As required by the SEC s PVP rules, we describe the information in columns (c) and (e) of the PVP Table as compensation actually paid (or CAP to the applicable PVP NEOs. However, we believe these CAP amounts do not entirely reflect the final compensation that our NEOs actually earned for their service in the Covered Years, respectively. Instead, in accordance with the SEC s PVP rules the amounts represent a combination of realized pay

Table of Contents 
 (primarily for cash amounts and equity that vested in the applicable Covered Year) and realizable or accrued pay as of the last day of the applicable Covered Year (primarily for equity awards that are unvested or vested but unexercised). As a result, we urge investors to use caution when evaluating CAP amounts, as they are calculated in a manner different than any information that we may have presented before; and 

As required by the SEC s PVP rules, we provide information in the PVP Table below about our absolute total shareholder return TSR results and our U.S. GAAP net income results (the External Measures during the Covered Years. In column (h) we also present information with respect to our Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We present this measure as management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors by excluding certain income/(loss), expenses and gains and losses that may not be indicative of the Company s core operating and financial results. Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure because certain items included in the calculation of net income/(loss) may either mask or exaggerate trends in the Company s ongoing operating performance measures, by identifying the individual adjustments, provide a useful mechanism for investors to consider these adjusted measures with some or all the identified adjustments. The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the comparable GAAP financial measure is included in Non-GAAP Financial Measures in ITEM 7.

(2) For each covered year, in determining both the compensation actually paid for our PEO and the average compensation actually paid for our Non-PEO NEOs for purposes of this PVP Table, we deducted from or added back to the total amount of compensation reported in column (b) and column (d) for such Covered Year the following amounts:

(3) For each Covered Year, our total shareholder return TSR was calculated based on the yearly percentage change in our cumulative TSR on each of our Class A and Class D common stock, measured as the quotient of (a) the sum of (i) the cumulative amount of dividends for a period beginning with our closing price on the Nasdaq Global Market on December 31, 2020 through and including the last day of the fiscal year covered (each one- or two-year period, the Measurement Period ), assuming dividend reinvestment, plus (ii) the difference between our closing Class A and Class D stock prices at the end versus the beginning of the Measurement Period, divided by (b) our closing Class A and Class D share prices at the beginning of the Measurement Period. Each of these yearly percentage changes was then applied to a deemed fixed investment of 100 at the beginning of each Measurement Period to produce the Covered Year-end values of such investment as of the end of 2022 and 2021, as applicable. Because Covered Years are presented in the table in reverse chronical order (from top to bottom), the table should be read from bottom to top for purposes of understanding cumulative returns over time. The following charts provide, across the Covered Years, descriptions of the relationships between (1) the CAP for the PEO and the average CAP for our Non-PEO NEOs (in each case as set forth in the PVP Table above) and (2) each of the performance measures set forth in columns (f) and (g) of the PVP Table above.

 ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS We review all transactions and relationships in which Urban One and our directors and executive officers or their immediate family members are participants to determine whether such persons have a direct or indirect material interest. In addition, our code of ethics requires our directors, executive officers, and principal financial officers to report to the board or the audit committee any situation that could be perceived as a conflict of interest. Once a related person transaction has been identified, the Board of Directors may appoint a special committee of the Board of Directors to review and, if appropriate, approve such transaction. The special committee will consider the material facts, such as the nature of the related person s interest in the transaction, the terms of the transaction, the importance of the transaction to the related person and to us, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances, and other matters it deems appropriate. As required under the SEC rules, we disclose related party transactions that are directly or indirectly material to us or a related person. Reach Media operates the Tom Joyner Foundation s Fantastic Voyage (the Fantastic Voyage ), a fund-raising event, on behalf of the Tom Joyner Foundation, Inc. (the Foundation ), a 501(c)(3) entity.

Distributions from operating revenues are in the following order until the funds are depleted: up to 250,000 to the Foundation, reimbursement of Reach s expenditures, up to a 1.0 million fee to Reach, a performance bonus of up to 50 of remaining operating revenues to Reach Media, with the balance remaining to the Foundation. For 2021 and 2023, 250,000 to the Foundation is guaranteed; the Fantastic Voyage did not operate in 2022. Reach Media s earnings for the Fantastic Voyage in any given year may not exceed 1.75 million. The Foundation s remittances to Reach Media under the agreements are limited to its Fantastic Voyage related cash collections. Reach Media bears the risk should the Fantastic Voyage sustain a loss and bears all credit risk associated with the related passenger cruise package sales. The agreement between Reach and the Foundation automatically renews annually unless termination is mutually agreed or unless a party s financial requirements are not met, in which case the party not in breach of their obligations has the right, but not the obligation, to terminate unilaterally.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Shareholders and Board of Directors Urban One, Inc. Silver Spring, Maryland Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Urban One, Inc. s (the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria ). In our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management s statements referring to any corrective actions taken by the Company after the date of management s assessment. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements and our report dated June 30, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Material weaknesses regarding management s failure to design and maintain controls have been identified and described in management s assessment. The material weaknesses related to: 1) entity-level controls impacting the control environment, risk assessment procedures and monitoring activities; and 2) control activities which include: a) information technology general controls ITGCs in the areas of user access, program change management, and segregation of duties for certain information technology systems that support the Company s financial reporting and other processes; b) proper segregation of duties relating to the review of manual journal entries; c) effective controls over revenue, income taxes, content assets, launch assets, the preparation of the statements of cash flows and certain financial statement disclosures; d) effective review controls over the accounting and disclosures related to the investment in MGM National Harbor; and e) effective controls over the completeness and accuracy of the balances of radio broadcasting licenses, goodwill and related accounts, specifically, the Company s monitoring and control activities related to review of key third-party reports and assumptions used in the valuation of its radio broadcasting licenses, goodwill and related accounts. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2022 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated June 30, 2023 on those consolidated financial statements.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ BDO USA, LLP June 30, 2023

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Shareholders and Board of Directors Urban One, Inc. Silver Spring, Maryland Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Urban One, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and our report dated June 30, 2023 expressed an adverse opinion thereon. Restatement to Correct 2021 Misstatements As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the 2021 consolidated financial statements have been restated to correct misstatements. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Valuation of Certain Radio Broadcasting Licenses As described in Notes 3, 4 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired radio broadcasting licenses valued at approximately 23.6 million in 2022 and had total radio broadcasting licenses of approximately 488.4 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company tests radio broadcasting licenses for impairment annually, on October 1, or more frequently when events or circumstances or other conditions suggest impairment may have occurred. With the assistance

Table of Contents 
 of a third-party valuation firm, the Company estimates the fair value of radio broadcasting licenses acquired in business combinations and being tested for impairment using the income approach, which involves judgmental estimates and assumptions about market revenue and projected revenue growth by market, mature market share, mature operating profit margin, discount rate and the terminal growth rate. We have identified the Company s estimate of the fair value of the radio broadcasting licenses acquired in the business combination and certain licenses being tested for impairment as a critical audit matter. The fair value estimates are sensitive to changes in the significant assumptions such as market revenue and projected revenue growth by market, mature market share, mature operating profit margin, the discount rate and the terminal growth rate. Auditing these assumptions required increased auditor effort including the use of valuation specialists. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: Evaluating the reasonableness of the market revenue and mature market share utilized in the Company s forecasts for selected licenses by comparing to external market data and evaluating the projected revenue growth by market by comparing to external industry and market data. Utilizing professionals with specialized knowledge and experience in valuation to test the appropriateness of the mature operating profit margin, discount rate and terminal growth rate used. 
 Radio Market Goodwill Impairment Assessment As described in Notes 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s radio broadcasting segment goodwill balance was approximately 30.0 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually, on October 1, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances or other conditions suggest impairment may have occurred. An impairment exists when the radio market reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value. With the assistance of a third-party valuation firm, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using an income approach, which involves judgmental estimates and assumptions about revenue growth rates, future operating profit margins, the terminal growth rate and the discount rate. We have identified the estimate of the fair value of certain of the Company s radio market reporting units as a critical audit matter. The fair value estimates are sensitive to changes in the significant assumptions such as the revenue growth rates, future operating profit margins, the terminal growth rate and the discount rate. Auditing these assumptions required increased auditor effort including the use of valuation specialists. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: Testing the reasonableness of the revenue growth rates by comparing to external industry and market data and evaluating the future operating profit margins utilized in the Company s forecasts for selected radio market reporting units by comparing to recent historical results of the Company. Utilizing professionals with specialized knowledge and experience in valuation to test the appropriateness of the terminal growth rate and discount rate used. 
 Amortization of Commissioned Programming Content Assets As described in Notes 3 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s cable television segment engages third parties to develop and produce content, including original programming commissioned programming which is predominantly monetized as content groups determined by separate television programming genres. Content amortization expense for commissioned programming is based on an estimate of the Company s usage and benefit from such program based on a revenue forecast model. Management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization. The Company recognized 43.5 million of total amortization of content assets for the year ended December 31, 2022 which includes the amortization of commissioned programming content assets. We have identified the amortization of the Company s commissioned programming content assets as a critical audit matter. Management s estimates of remaining total revenues are sensitive to changes in projected viewership which is based on estimated household universe, ratings, and expected number of airings across different broadcast time slots. Auditing these inputs used in the amortization calculation for commissioned programming content assets required increased auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence.

 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: Testing management s forecasted amortization pattern for commissioned programming content asset groups through comparison of forecasted assumptions of estimated household universe, ratings and expected number of airings across different broadcast time slots to actual data from historical periods and subsequent to the balance sheet date. Testing the completeness and accuracy of the historical viewership data including estimated household universe, ratings and number of airings across different broadcast time slots used to calculate the estimate of total remaining revenues.

An amount of approximately million was recorded as an unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities, net of tax in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company recorded an opening balance adjustment of approximately million within AOCI in the December 31, 2021 consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity.

 million, million, and million as of December 31, 2019, March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021, respectively, and understated by approximately million as of September 30, 2020. Accordingly, the Company recorded an out-of-period non-cash impairment charge of approximately million during the three months ended June 30, 2022 as the Company determined that the errors were not material to any previous period and that correcting the errors in the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 would not materially misstate net revenue or pre-tax income for the full year, as of and for the period ended December 31, 2022, or the earnings trend and therefore could be corrected in the period ending June 30, 2022. Additionally, during the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company identified that certain assumptions used in the valuation of the Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Raleigh, and Richmond assets for the quarters ended June 30 and September 30, 2022 were incorrect and resulted in overstatements of the fair value of the radio broadcasting licenses by approximately million and million, respectively. The Company, in the process of rectifying the material MGM Investment error identified above, determined it was necessary to accurately reflect the out-of-period non-cash impairment charge of approximately million across all Affected Periods and to record the non-cash impairment charges of approximately million and million for the second and third quarters of 2022, respectively. Consequently, the Company made the following adjustments: a reversal of the million impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2022, an opening balance sheet adjustment of a million non-cash impairment charge for 2019 and 2020 during the first quarter of 2021, a million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2021, and approximately million and million of impairment charges during the second and third quarters of 2022. Additionally, the Company included the associated tax implications of these adjustments. The correction of this misstatement resulted in a decrease to radio broadcasting licenses of million, an increase to deferred tax assets, net of , and an increase to accumulated deficit of million in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. Impairment of long-lived assets increased by million and provision for income taxes decreased by in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. Comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2021, decreased by million. The Company recorded an opening balance adjustment of million and an adjustment of million to reduce consolidated net income within accumulated deficit in the December 31, 2021 consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity. While in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, this correction reduced consolidated net income by million, reduced deferred income taxes by , and increased impairment of long-lived assets by million, it had impact on total net cash flows (used in) provided by operating, investing, or financing activities. Right of Use Assets During the adoption of ASC 842, Leases ASC 842 in 2019, the Company discovered that approximately million of deferred rent balances were not correctly accounted for, and as such, this resulted in an overstatement of right of use ROU assets for the same amount. The Company determined that the errors were not material and not correcting the errors would not materially misstate net revenue, pre-tax income, or the earnings trend in any previous or future periods. The Company, in the process of rectifying the material MGM Investment error identified above, determined it was necessary to correct these errors. Consequently, the Company has made corrections to record an opening balance sheet adjustment and associated tax impacts for the Affected Periods. The correction of this misstatement resulted in a decrease to ROU assets of approximately million, a decrease to deferred tax assets, net of approximately , and an increase to accumulated deficit of in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.

 . This correction did not impact the consolidated statement of operations, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021. Reach Media Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest The redeemable noncontrolling interest is measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology, adjusted for excess available working capital. In connection with the preparation of its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company identified an error in its calculation of excess working capital which understated the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest. As a result, the Company determined it was necessary to correct the error and recorded opening adjustments to the redeemable noncontrolling interests and additional paid-in capital APIC for the Affected Periods. The correction of this misstatement resulted in an increase to redeemable noncontrolling interest and a decrease to additional paid-in capital of approximately million in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. The Company recorded to increase the adjustment of redeemable noncontrolling interests to estimated redemption value and recorded an opening balance adjustment of approximately million within APIC in the December 31, 2021 consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity. This correction did not impact the consolidated statement of operations, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021. Launch Assets The cable television segment has entered into certain affiliate agreements requiring various payments for launch support, which are used to initiate carriage under affiliation agreements and are amortized over the term of the respective contracts. The Company has historically recorded amortization associated with certain launch assets within selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the preparation of its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company determined that this amortization should have been recorded as a reduction to revenue. As a result, the Company has reclassified the amortization to reduce selling, general and administrative expense and net revenue in the consolidated statements of operations for the Affected Periods. The correction of this misstatement decreased both net revenue and selling, general and administrative expense by approximately million in the December 31, 2021 consolidated statement of operations. This correction did not impact any other consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Balance Sheet Misclassifications The Company recorded adjustments to recognize certain balance sheet misclassifications for the Affected Periods. These adjustments primarily related to the classification of other current assets, other assets, other intangible assets, net, right of use assets, trade accounts receivable, net, other current liabilities, and accounts payable. Disclosure Exceptions In reconciling the income tax provision to actual tax returns filed, the Company identified that the 2021 estimate of nondeductible interest expense was calculated incorrectly. This error resulted in a disclosure exception within the Income Taxes footnote with net operating loss carryforwards overstated and interest expense carryforward understated, both by approximately million. The disclosure exception did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements for any of the prior periods. The Company, in the process of rectifying the material MGM Investment error identified above, determined it was necessary to correct the disclosure exception by revising the balances for net operating loss carryforwards and interest expense carryforward as of December 31, 2021 as disclosed within the Income Taxes footnote in these consolidated financial statements.

 million, a reduction to Acquired Licensed content assets of approximately million, and a decrease to accumulated amortization of approximately million as of December 31, 2021. In addition, the Company recorded an adjustment of from Completed content assets to In-Production content assets. This correction did not impact total net content assets disclosed within the footnote and included in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Statements of Cash Flows Prior to and as of the period ended September 30, 2022, the Company presented non-cash lease liability expense as an adjustment to net income within the consolidated statements of cash flows. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company identified that the non-cash lease liability expense should have been presented as a change in other liabilities and determined that it was necessary to correct the error for the Affected Periods. The correction of this misstatement resulted in a reduction to non-cash lease liability expense and an increase to other liabilities by approximately million in the consolidated statement of cash flows as of December 31, 2021. This correction had no impact on total net cash flows (used in) provided by operating, investing, or financing activities or any other consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Description of Restatement Tables The following tables reflect the impact of the restatement to the specific line items presented in the Company s consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity, and consolidated statements of cash flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. The previously reported amounts were derived from the Company s Original Filing. These amounts are labeled As Previously Reported in the tables below. The column labeled Adjustments represents the impact of the correction of the MGM Investment. The column labeled Other Adjustments represents the combined effects of the corrections of the misstatements relating to radio broadcasting license impairment, right of use assets, fair value of the Reach Media redeemable noncontrolling interest, amortization of certain launch assets, misclassifications of certain line items in the balance sheets and statements of cash flows, and any related tax effects, as described above, that were deemed immaterial to any period presented in our previously issued financial statements.

In connection with the Original HCA, RVAEH and its former development partner Pacific Peninsula Entertainment funded the Upfront Payment into escrow to be released to the City upon successful passage of the Referendum or back to RVAEH in the event the Referendum failed. In November 2021, the required Referendum was conducted and failed to pass. However, on January 24, 2022, the Richmond City Council adopted a new resolution in efforts to bring the ONE Casino + Resort to the City. The new resolution was the first of several steps in pursuit of a second referendum. The City and RVAEH then entered into a new Host Community Agreement (the New HCA which also included an Upfront Payment to be held in escrow and payable upon successful passage of a citywide referendum permitting development of the Project. After the City and RVAEH entered into the New HCA, the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation that sought to delay the second referendum that was anticipated to occur in November 2022. While there were some questions as to the applicability of the legislation, RVAEH and the City determined to adhere to the legislation and to seek a second referendum in November 2023. As a result of the efforts to obtain a second referendum, including execution of the New HCA and the determination to seek a second referendum in November 2023, the Upfront Payment remains in escrow. Therefore, the Company s portion of the Upfront Payment, approximately million is classified as restricted cash on the balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Within our digital segment, Interactive One generates the majority of the Company s digital revenue. Our digital revenue is principally derived from advertising services on non-radio station branded, but Company-owned websites. Advertising services include the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements. As the Company runs its advertising campaigns, the customer simultaneously receives benefits as impressions are delivered, and revenue is recognized over time. The amount of revenue recognized each month is based on the number of impressions delivered multiplied by the effective per impression unit price, and is equal to the amount receivable from the customer. Our cable television segment derives advertising revenue from the sale of television airtime to advertisers and revenue is recognized over time when the advertisements are run. In the agreements governing advertising campaigns, the Company may also promise to deliver to its customers a guaranteed minimum number of viewers impressions on a specific television network within a particular demographic. These advertising campaigns are considered to represent a single, distinct performance obligation. Revenues are recognized based on the guaranteed audience level multiplied by the average price per impression. The Company provides the advertiser with advertising until the guaranteed audience level is delivered, and invoiced advertising revenue receivables may exceed the value of the audience delivery. As such, a portion of revenues are deferred until the guaranteed audience level is delivered or the rights associated with the guarantee

Our cable television segment also derives revenue from affiliate fees under the terms of various multi-year affiliation agreements based on a per subscriber royalty payable by the affiliate, in exchange for the right to distribute the Company s programming. The majority of the Company s distribution fees are collected monthly throughout the year and distribution revenue is recognized over the term of the contracts based on contracted programming rates and reported subscriber levels. The Company applies the sales- or usage-based royalty exception for its affiliate agreements. The amount of distribution fees due to the Company is reported by distributors based on actual subscriber levels. Such information is generally not received until after the close of the reporting period. In these cases, the Company estimates the number of subscribers receiving the Company s programming to estimate royalty revenue. Historical adjustments to recorded estimates have not been material. Revenues from the Company s cable television segment are reduced by the amortization of the Company s launch support assets. Some of the Company s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the individual performance obligations are separately accounted for if they are distinct. In an arrangement with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated among the separate performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. The determination of stand-alone selling price considers market conditions, the size and scope of the contract, customer information, and other factors.

The Company has also made an accounting policy election to exclude leases with an initial term of twelve months or less from recognition on the consolidated balance sheet. Short-term leases will be expensed over the lease term. The Company also elected to separate the consideration in the lease contracts between the lease and non-lease components. All variable non-lease components are expensed as incurred. ASC 842 results in significant changes to the balance sheets of lessees, most significantly by requiring the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. Upon adoption of ASC 842, deferred rent balances, which were historically presented separately, were combined and presented net within the ROU assets. Many of the Company s leases provide for renewal terms and escalation clauses, which are factored into calculating the lease liabilities when appropriate. The implicit rate within the Company s lease agreements is generally not determinable and as such the Company s collateralized borrowing rate is used.

As a result of its impairment test, the Company recorded impairment of approximately million during the three months ended June 30, 2022, associated with certain of our radio market broadcasting licenses. In addition, the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in the three months ended June 30, 2022, associated with the estimated asset sale consideration for one of our Indianapolis radio broadcasting licenses. During the third quarter of 2022, economic conditions continued to slow and interest rates continued to rise. The Company performed additional impairment tests, and recorded an impairment of approximately million associated with certain of our radio market broadcasting licenses. We completed our 2022 annual impairment assessment as of October 1, 2022. There was lower than forecasted revenue growth and operating profit margin in certain markets. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, associated with certain of our radio market broadcasting licenses. When evaluating our radio broadcasting licenses for impairment, the testing is done at the unit of accounting level as determined by ASC 350 . In our case, each unit of accounting is a cluster of radio stations into one of our geographical markets. Broadcasting license fair values are based on the discounted future cash flows of the applicable unit of accounting assuming an initial hypothetical start-up operation which possesses FCC licenses as the only asset. Over time, it is assumed the operation acquires other tangible assets such as advertising and programming contracts, employment agreements and going concern value, and matures into an average performing operation in a specific radio market.

The amount of the state NOLs may change if future apportionment factors differ from current factors. Additionally, the Company continues to assess potential tax strategies, which if successful, may reduce the impact of the annual limitations and potentially recover NOLs that otherwise would expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities. If successful, the Company may be able to recover additional federal and state NOLs in future periods, which could be material. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize additional federal and state NOLs, the tax benefit could materially impact future quarterly and annual periods. However, if these potential tax strategies do not meet the more likely than not threshold, the Company may claim these additional NOLs as unrecognized tax benefits. The federal and state NOLs expire in various years from 2023 to 2039. As of December 31, 2022, the gross deferred tax assets of approximately million were primarily the result of federal and state net operating losses and the IRC Section 163(j) interest expense carryforward.

The assessment to determine the value of the deferred tax assets to be realized under ASC 740 is highly judgmental and requires the consideration of all available positive and negative evidence in evaluating the likelihood of realizing the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets in a future period.

Pursuant to the terms of each of our stock plans and subject to the Company s insider trading policy, a portion of each recipient s vested shares may be sold in the open market for tax purposes on or about the vesting dates. The Company measures compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognizes the related expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The restricted stock-based awards do not participate in dividends until fully vested. The fair value of stock options is determined using the BSM. Such fair value is recognized as an expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the straight-line method. Estimating the number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual forfeitures differ substantially from our current estimates, amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimated number of stock awards are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including the types of awards, employee classification and historical experience. Actual forfeitures may differ substantially from our current estimate. The Company s use of the BSM to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected life, and interest rates. For options granted, the BSM determines: (i) the term by using the simplified plain-vanilla method as allowed under SAB No. 110; (ii) a historical volatility over a period commensurate with the expected term, with the observation of the volatility on a daily basis; and (iii) a risk-free interest rate that was consistent with the expected term of the stock options and based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was approximately million and , respectively. The Company granted a total of stock options during the year ended December 31, 2022 and granted a total of stock options during the year ended December 31, 2021.

SECTION 2. Amount and Terms of Credit . 2.01. Revolving Loans and Borrowings. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and during the term of this Agreement, each Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment agrees (severally, not jointly or jointly and severally) to make revolving loans Revolving Loans to the Borrowers in an amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the lesser of : (i) such Lender s Revolving Loan Commitment Amount, or (ii) such Lender s Pro Rata Share of an amount equal to the lesser of: (A) the Revolving Loan Limit less the Letter of Credit Usage at such time, or (B) the Borrowing Base at such time less the Letter of Credit Usage at such time.

(c) Anything to the contrary in this Section 2.01 notwithstanding, Administrative Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation) to, upon five (5) Business Days prior written notice (during which period the Administrative Agent shall discuss any such proposed establishment, increase, reduction, elimination or other adjustment with the Administrative Borrower and the Administrative Borrower may take such actions as may be required to ensure that the event, condition or matter that is the basis of such establishment, increase, reduction, elimination or other adjustment no longer exists such that the applicable reserve is eliminated) to the Administrative Borrower (provided that such establishment, increase, reduction, elimination or other adjustment of a reserve shall become effective immediately upon the delivery of such written notice for purposes of determining Availability in connection with any Credit Event thereafter), establish, increase, reduce, eliminate, or otherwise adjust reserves from time to time against the Borrowing Base or the Revolving Loan Limit in such amounts, and with respect to such matters 
 55 

 (but without duplication), as Administrative Agent in its Permitted Discretion shall deem necessary or appropriate, including (i) reserves in an amount equal to the Bank Product Reserve Amount, and (ii) reserves with respect to (A) sums that the Administrative Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries are required to pay under any Section of this Agreement or any other Credit Document (such as Taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, or, in the case of leased assets, rents or other amounts payable under such leases) and has failed to pay when due, and (B) amounts owing by the Administrative Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person to the extent secured by a Lien on, or trust over, any of the Collateral (other than a Permitted Lien), which Lien or trust, in Administrative Agent s Permitted Discretion, likely would have a priority superior to Administrative Agent s Liens (such as Liens or trusts in favor of landlords, warehousemen, carriers, mechanics, materialmen, laborers, or suppliers, or Liens or trusts for ad valorem , excise, sales, or other Taxes where given priority under applicable law) in and to such item of the Collateral. (d) The Revolving Loan Commitment shall terminate on the Maturity Date. The Borrowers may reduce the Revolving Loan Commitment, without premium or penalty, by providing written notice of their intent to do so, to an amount not less than the sum of (i) the Revolver Usage as of such date, plus (ii) the principal amount of all Revolving Loans not yet made as to which a request has been given by the Borrowers under Section 2.02(a), plus (iii) the amount of all Letters of Credit not yet issued as to which a request has been given by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.04(a).

Once reduced, the Revolving Loan Commitment may not be increased unless the Borrowers, Administrative Agent and Required Lenders otherwise agree in writing, and subject to consent of each such Lender which Revolving Loan Commitment is being increased in accordance with Section 12.12. Each such reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitment shall reduce the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount of each Revolving Lender proportionately in accordance with its Pro Rata Share thereof. 2.02. Advancing Revolving Loans and Settlements (a) Procedure for Borrowing . Each Borrowing shall be made by the delivery of a Notice of Borrowing duly executed by an Authorized Officer of the Administrative Borrower delivered to Administrative Agent (which may be delivered through Administrative Agent s electronic platform or portal). Such notice shall be irrevocable and must be received by Administrative Agent no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) (x) with respect to Term SOFR Loans, two (2) Business Days immediately preceding the requested Funding Date, and (y) with respect to Base Rate Loans, on the Business Day immediately preceding the requested Funding Date, in each case, specifying (i) the amount of such Borrowing and which Borrower is requesting such Borrowing, (ii) the requested Funding Date, which shall be a Business Day, (iii) the Type of Revolving Loans to be borrowed and (iii) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto . At Administrative Agent s election, in lieu of delivering the above-described written request, any Authorized Officer of the Administrative Borrower may give Administrative Agent telephonic notice of such request by the required time. In such circumstances, the Administrative Borrower agrees that any such telephonic notice will be confirmed in writing within twenty-four (24) hours of the giving of such telephonic notice, but the failure to provide such written confirmation shall not affect the validity of the request. All Borrowing requests which are not made on-line via Administrative Agent s electronic platform or portal shall be subject to (and unless Administrative Agent elects otherwise in the exercise of its sole discretion, such Borrowings shall not be made until the completion of) Administrative Agent s authentication process (with results satisfactory to Administrative Agent) prior to the funding of any such requested Borrowing. 
 56 

 (b) Making of Loans. (i) Promptly after receipt of a request for a Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.02(a), Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders, not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Funding Date applicable thereto, by telecopy, telephone, or other similar form of transmission, of the requested Borrowing. Each Revolving Lender shall make the amount of such Revolving Lender s Pro Rata Share of the requested Borrowing available to Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, to Administrative Agent s Account, not later than 10:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Funding Date applicable thereto. After Administrative Agent s receipt of the proceeds of such Revolving Loans, Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds thereof available to the applicable Borrower on the applicable Funding Date by transferring immediately available funds equal to such proceeds received by Administrative Agent to the Designated Account; provided , however , that subject to the provisions of Section 2.02(c)(ii), Administrative Agent shall not request any Revolving Lender to make, and no Revolving Lender shall have the obligation to make, any Revolving Loan if (A) one or more of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 will not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing unless such condition has been waived, or (B) the requested Borrowing would exceed the Availability on such Funding Date. (ii) Unless Administrative Agent receives notice from a Revolving Lender prior to 9:00 a.m. (New York time) on the date of a Borrowing, that such Revolving Lender will not make available as and when required hereunder to Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Borrower the amount of that Revolving Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing, Administrative Agent may assume that each Revolving Lender has made or will make such amount available to Administrative Agent in immediately available funds on the Funding Date and Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If any Revolving Lender shall not have made its full amount available to Administrative Agent in immediately available funds and if Administrative Agent in such circumstances has made available to the applicable Borrower such amount, that Revolving Lender shall on the Business Day following such Funding Date make such amount available to Administrative Agent, together with interest at the Defaulted Lender Rate for each day during such period. A notice submitted by Administrative Agent to any Revolving Lender with respect to amounts owing under this Section 2.02(b)(ii) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such amount is so made available, such payment to Administrative Agent shall constitute such Revolving Lender s Revolving Loan on the date of Borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made available to Administrative Agent on the Business Day following the Funding Date, Administrative Agent will notify the Administrative Borrower of such failure to fund and, upon demand by Administrative Agent, the Borrowers shall pay such amount to Administrative Agent for Administrative Agent s account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Revolving Loans composing such Borrowing; provided , that such repayment shall not constitute a waiver of any of the Borrowers rights under this Agreement. (iii) [Intentionally Omitted]. (iv) If requested by a Lender, the portion of the Revolving Loans made by such Lender shall be evidenced by a promissory note executed by the Borrowers in an original principal amount equal to such Lender s Revolving Loan Commitment Amount. (c) Protective Advances and Optional Overadvances . (i) Any contrary provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document notwithstanding, Administrative Agent hereby is authorized by the Borrowers and the Lenders, from time 
 57 

 to time in Administrative Agent s Permitted Discretion, to make Revolving Loans to, or for the benefit of, the Borrowers on behalf of the Lenders that Administrative Agent, in its Permitted Discretion, deems necessary or desirable (A) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, or (B) to enhance the likelihood of repayment of the Obligations (other than the Bank Product Obligations) (any of the Revolving Loans described in this Section 2.02(c)(i) shall be referred to as Protective Advances ). (ii) Any contrary provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document notwithstanding, the Lenders hereby authorize Administrative Agent and Administrative Agent may, but is not obligated to, knowingly and intentionally, continue to make Revolving Loans to the Borrowers notwithstanding that an Overadvance exists or thereby would be created, so long as (A) after giving effect to such Revolving Loans, the outstanding Revolver Usage (except for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or expenses) does not exceed the Revolving Loan Limit and (B) at the time of the making of any such Revolving Loan, Administrative Agent does not believe, in good faith, that the Overadvance created by such Revolving Loan will be outstanding for more than ninety (90) days. In the event Administrative Agent obtains actual knowledge that the Revolver Usage exceeds the amounts permitted by the immediately foregoing provisions, regardless of the amount of, or reason for, such excess, Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders as soon as practicable (and prior to making any (or any additional) intentional Overadvances (except for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, costs and expenses) unless Administrative Agent determines that prior notice would result in imminent harm to the Collateral or its value, in which case Administrative Agent may make such Overadvances and provide notice as promptly as practicable thereafter), and the Lenders thereupon shall, together with Administrative Agent, jointly determine the terms of arrangements that shall be implemented with the Borrowers intended to reduce, within a reasonable time, the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans to the Borrowers to an amount permitted by the preceding sentence. In such circumstances, if any Lender objects to the proposed terms of reduction or repayment of any Overadvance, the terms of reduction or repayment thereof shall be implemented according to the determination of the Required Lenders. In any event: (x) if any unintentional Overadvance remains outstanding for more than thirty (30) days, unless otherwise agreed to by the Required Lenders, the Borrowers shall immediately repay Revolving Loans in an amount sufficient to eliminate all such unintentional Overadvances, and (y) after the date all such Overadvances have been eliminated, there must be at least five (5) consecutive days before intentional Overadvances are made. The foregoing provisions are meant for the benefit of the Lenders and Administrative Agent and are not meant for the benefit of the Borrowers, which shall continue to be bound by the provisions of Section 2.02(h). Each Revolving Lender shall be obligated to settle with Administrative Agent as provided in Section 2.02(d) (or Section 2.02(f), as applicable) for the amount of such Revolving Lender s Pro Rata Share of any unintentional Overadvances by Administrative Agent reported to such Lender, any intentional Overadvances made as permitted under this Section 2.02(c)(ii), and any Overadvances resulting from the charging to the Loan Account of interest, costs, fees and expenses. (iii) Each Protective Advance made for the account of Administrative Agent and each Overadvance shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder; except , that, no Protective Advance or Overadvance shall be eligible to be a Term SOFR Loan and, prior to settlement therefor, all payments on the Protective Advances shall be payable to the Administrative Agent solely for its own account. The Protective Advances and Overadvances shall be repayable on demand, secured by Administrative Agent s Liens, constitute Obligations hereunder, and bear interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans. The ability of Administrative Agent to make Protective Advances is separate and distinct from its ability to make Overadvances and its ability to make Overadvances is separate and distinct from its ability to make Protective Advances. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations on Administrative Agent s ability to make Protective Advances do not apply to Overadvances and the limitations on Administrative Agent s ability to make Overadvances do not apply to Protective Advances. The provisions of this Section 2.02(c) are for the exclusive benefit of Administrative Agent and the Lenders and are not intended to benefit the Borrowers in any way. 
 58 

 (d) Settlement . It is agreed that each Revolving Lender s funded portion of the Revolving Loans is intended by the Revolving Lenders to equal, at all times, such Revolving Lender s Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Revolving Loans. Such agreement notwithstanding, Administrative Agent and the other Revolving Lenders agree (which agreement shall not be for the benefit of the Borrowers) that in order to facilitate the administration of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, settlement among the Revolving Lenders as to the Revolving Loans and the Protective Advances funded by Administrative Agent shall take place on a periodic basis in accordance with the following provisions: (i) Administrative Agent shall request settlement Settlement with the Revolving Lenders on a weekly basis, or on a more frequent basis if so determined by Administrative Agent (A) for itself, with respect to the outstanding Protective Advances funded by Administrative Agent, and (2) with respect to the Administrative Borrower s or its Subsidiaries collections out of the Collateral or payments received, as to each by notifying the Revolving Lenders by telecopy, telephone, or other similar form of transmission, of such requested Settlement, no later than 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on the Business Day immediately prior to the date of such requested Settlement (the date of such requested Settlement being the Settlement Date ). Such notice of a Settlement Date shall include a summary statement of the amount of outstanding Revolving Loans and Protective Advances funded by Administrative Agent for the period since the prior Settlement Date. Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein (including Section 2.02(f)): (y) if the amount of the Revolving Loans (including Protective Advances funded by Administrative Agent) made by a Revolving Lender that is not a Defaulted Lender exceeds such Revolving Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Protective Advances funded by Administrative Agent) as of a Settlement Date, then Administrative Agent shall, by no later than 12:00 p.m. (New York time) on the Settlement Date, transfer in immediately available funds to a Deposit Account of such Revolving Lender (as such Revolving Lender may designate), an amount such that each such Revolving Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have as of the Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Protective Advances funded by Administrative Agent), and (z) if the amount of the Revolving Loans (including Protective Advances funded by Administrative Agent) made by a Revolving Lender is less than such Revolving Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Protective Advances funded by Administrative Agent) as of a Settlement Date, such Revolving Lender shall no later than 12:00 p.m. (New York time) on the Settlement Date transfer in immediately available funds to Administrative Agent s Account, an amount such that each such Revolving Lender shall, upon transfer of such amount, have as of the Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Protective Advances funded by Administrative Agent). Such amounts made available to Administrative Agent under clause (z) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be applied against the amounts of the Protective Advances funded by Administrative Agent and shall constitute Revolving Loans of such Revolving Lenders. If any such amount is not made available to Administrative Agent by any Revolving Lender on the Settlement Date applicable thereto to the extent required by the terms hereof, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover for its account such amount on demand from such Revolving Lender together with interest thereon at the Defaulted Lender Rate. (ii) In determining whether a Revolving Lender s balance of the Revolving Loans and Protective Advances funded by Administrative Agent is less than, equal to, or greater than such Revolving Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans and Protective Advances funded by Administrative Agent as of a Settlement Date, Administrative Agent shall, as part of the relevant Settlement, apply to such balance the portion of payments actually received in good funds by Administrative Agent with respect to principal, interest, fees payable by the Borrowers and allocable to the Revolving Lenders hereunder, and proceeds of Collateral. (iii) [Intentionally Omitted]. 
 59 

 (iv) Anything in this Section 2.02(d) to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that a Revolving Lender is a Defaulted Lender, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from remitting settlement amounts to the Defaulted Lender and, instead, shall be entitled to elect to implement the provisions set forth in Section 2.02(f). (e) Notation . Administrative Agent, as a non-fiduciary agent for the Borrowers, shall maintain a register showing the principal amount of the Revolving Loans owing to each Lender, including the Protective Advances, and the interests therein of each Lender, from time to time. Such register shall, absent manifest error, conclusively be presumed to be correct and accurate, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement . The register shall, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior written notice to Administrative Agent, be made available for inspection by the Borrowers. (f) Defaulted Lenders . Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulted Lender any payments made by the Borrowers to Administrative Agent for the Defaulted Lender s benefit or any collections out of the Collateral or proceeds of Collateral that would otherwise be remitted hereunder to the Defaulted Lender, and, in the absence of such transfer to the Defaulted Lender, Administrative Agent shall transfer any such payments (i) first, to the Issuing Lender, to the extent of the portion of a Letter of Credit Disbursement that was required to be, but was not, repaid by the Defaulted Lender, (ii) second, to each non-Defaulted Lender ratably in accordance with their Commitments (but, in each case, only to the extent that such Defaulted Lender s portion of a Revolving Loan (or other funding obligation) was funded by such other non-Defaulted Lender), (iii) third, to a suspense account maintained by Administrative Agent, the proceeds of which shall be retained by Administrative Agent and may be made available to be re-advanced to or for the benefit of the Borrowers as if such Defaulted Lender had made its portion of Revolving Loans (or other funding obligations) hereunder, and (iv) from and after the date on which all other Obligations have been paid in full, to such Defaulted Lender. Subject to the foregoing, Administrative Agent may hold and, in its Permitted Discretion, re-lend to the Borrowers for the account of such Defaulted Lender the amount of all such payments received and retained by Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulted Lender. Each Defaulted Lender agrees that all payments made by the Borrowers for any Loans shall be deemed to be made to all Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Share and no Defaulted Lender shall have a direct cause of action against the Borrowers for payments made to Administrative Agent that Administrative Agent has not paid over or credited to Defaulted Lender due to the terms of this Agreement. Solely for the purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Credit Documents (including the calculation of Pro Rata Share in connection therewith) and for the purpose of calculating the fee payable under Section 3.02, such Defaulted Lender shall be deemed not to be a Lender and such Lender s Commitment shall be deemed to be zero. The provisions of this Section 2.02(f) shall remain effective with respect to such Defaulted Lender until the earlier of (A) the date on which the non-Defaulted Lenders, Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Borrower shall have waived, in writing, the application of this Section 2.02(f) to such Defaulted Lender, or (B) the date on which such Defaulted Lender makes payment of all amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder, pays to Administrative Agent all amounts owing by Defaulted Lender in respect of the amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder, and, if requested by Administrative Agent, provides adequate assurance of its ability to perform its future obligations hereunder. The operation of this Section 2.02(f) shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Lender, to relieve or excuse the performance by such Defaulted Lender or any other Lender of its duties and obligations hereunder, or to relieve or excuse the performance by the Borrowers of their duties and obligations hereunder to Administrative Agent or to the Lenders other than such Defaulted Lender. Any failure by a Defaulted Lender to fund amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder shall constitute a material breach by such Defaulted Lender of this Agreement and shall entitle the Borrowers, at their option, upon written notice to Administrative Agent, to arrange for a substitute Lender to assume the Commitment of such Defaulted Lender, such substitute Lender to be 
 60 

 reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent. In connection with the arrangement of such a substitute Lender, the Defaulted Lender shall have no right to refuse to be replaced hereunder, and agrees to execute and deliver a completed form of Assignment and Acceptance in favor of the substitute Lender (and agrees that it shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such document if it fails to do so) subject only to being repaid its share of the outstanding Obligations (other than Bank Product Obligations, but including (1) all interest, fees, and other amounts that may be due and payable in respect thereof, and (2) an assumption of its Pro Rata Share of the Letters of Credit); provided , however , that any such assumption of the Commitment of such Defaulted Lender shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any of the Lender s or the Borrowers rights or remedies against any such Defaulted Lender arising out of or in relation to such failure to fund. In the event of a direct conflict between the priority provisions of this Section 2.02(f) and any other provision contained in this Agreement or any other Credit Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such provisions be read together and construed, to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other. In the event of any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this Section 2.02(f) shall control and govern. (g) Independent Obligations . All Revolving Loans (other than Protective Advances funded by Administrative Agent) shall be made by the Lenders contemporaneously and in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares. It is understood that (i) no Lender shall be responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loan (or other extension of credit) hereunder, nor shall any Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii) no failure by any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder shall excuse any other Lender from its obligations hereunder. (h) Overadvances . If, at any time or for any reason, the amount of Obligations (excluding Bank Product Obligations) owed by the Borrowers to the Revolving Lenders pursuant to Section 2.01(a) or Section 2.04 is greater than any of the limitations set forth in Section 2.01(a) or Section 2.04, as applicable (an Overadvance ), except as otherwise provided for under Section 2.02(c), the Borrowers shall promptly (no later than one (1) Business Day after the occurrence of such Overadvance) pay to Administrative Agent, in cash, the amount of such excess in accordance with Section 2.03(b). (i) Disqualification of a Lender . If any Lender is subject to a Disqualification (and such Lender is notified by the Administrative Borrower or the Administrative Agent in writing of such Disqualification), the Borrowers shall have the right to replace such Lender with a Lender acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or prepay the Loans held by such Lender, even if a Default or an Event of Default exists. Any such prepayment shall not be subject to any prepayment premium and shall not be required to be made on a pro rata basis. Notice to such Lender shall be given at least ten (10) days before the required date of transfer or prepayment (unless a shorter period is required by any applicable Gaming Law), as the case may be, and shall be accompanied by evidence demonstrating that such transfer or redemption is required under applicable Gaming Laws and based on the definition of Disqualification. Upon receipt of a notice in accordance with the foregoing, the Lender that is subject to Disqualification shall cooperate with the Borrowers in effectuating the required transfer or prepayment within the time period set forth in such notice, not to be less than the minimum notice period set forth in the foregoing sentence (unless a shorter period is required under any applicable Gaming Law). Further, if the transfer or prepayment is triggered by notice from a Gaming Authority that the Lender is subject to a Disqualification, commencing on the date such Gaming Authority provides the disqualification notice to the Administrative Borrower, to the extent prohibited by Gaming Law: (i) such Lender shall no longer exercise, directly or through any trustee or nominee, any right conferred by the Loans; and (ii) such Lender shall not receive any remuneration in any form from the Borrowers for services or otherwise in respect of the Loans (other than payments with respect to principal, interest, fees and other amounts owed to such Lender). 
 61 

 (j) Conforming Changes . With respect to SOFR or Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent will have the right, in consultation with the Borrower Representative, to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Credit Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Credit Document; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrowers and the Lenders promptly after such amendment becomes effective. 2.03. Mandatory and Optional Revolving Loan Repayments . (a) Repayment Upon Termination Date . The Revolving Loan Commitment shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) any date on which Administrative Agent or Required Lenders elect to terminate the Revolving Loan Commitment pursuant to the last paragraph in Section 10 (such earlier date being the Termination Date ). On the Termination Date, there shall become due, and the Borrowers shall pay, the entire outstanding principal amount of each Revolving Loan, together with accrued and unpaid Obligations pertaining thereto. (b) Borrowing Base . If, at any time, (i) the Revolver Usage on such date exceeds (ii) the Borrowing Base (such excess being referred to as the Borrowing Base Excess ), then the Borrowers shall promptly (no later than one (1) Business Day after the occurrence of such Borrowing Base Excess) prepay the Revolving Loans in accordance in an aggregate amount equal to the Borrowing Base Excess. If, at any time, (x) the Revolver Usage on such date exceeds (y) the aggregate amount of Revolving Loans permitted pursuant to Section 2.01(a) (such excess being referred to as the Excess Revolving Loans ), then the Borrowers shall promptly (no later than one (1) Business Day after the occurrence of such Excess Revolving Loans) prepay the Revolving Loans in an aggregate amount equal to the Excess Revolving Loans. 2.04. Letters of Credit . (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, upon the request of the Administrative Borrower made in accordance herewith, the Issuing Lender agrees to issue a requested Letter of Credit. By submitting a request to Issuing Lender for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Borrower shall be deemed to have requested that Issuing Lender issue the requested Letter of Credit. Each request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or the amendment, renewal, or extension of any outstanding Letter of Credit, shall be made in writing by an Authorized Officer and delivered to the Issuing Lender via hand delivery, telefacsimile, or other electronic method of transmission reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension. Each such request shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Issuing Lender and shall specify (i) the amount of such Letter of Credit, (ii) the date of issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension of such Letter of Credit, (iii) the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, (iv) the name and address of the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit, and (v) such other information (including, in the case of an amendment, renewal, or extension, identification of the Letter of Credit to be so amended, renewed, or extended) as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew, or extend such Letter of Credit. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Issuing Lender may, but shall not be obligated to, issue or cause the issuance of a Letter of Credit that supports the obligations of the Administrative Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries (1) in respect of (A) a lease of real property, or (B) an employment contract, or (2) at any time that one or more of the Revolving Lenders is a Defaulted Lender. The Issuing Lender shall have no obligation to issue a Letter of Credit if any of the following would result after giving effect to the requested issuance: 
 62 

 (i) the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Borrowing Base less the outstanding amount of Revolving Loans, or (ii) the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed 5,000,000, or (iii) the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Revolving Loan Limit less the outstanding amount of Revolving Loans. Each Letter of Credit shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Issuing Lender, including the requirement that the amounts payable thereunder must be payable in Dollars, and shall expire on a date no more than twelve (12) months after the date of issuance or last renewal of such Letter of Credit, which date shall be no later than the Stated Maturity Date. If Issuing Lender makes a payment under a Letter of Credit, the Borrowers shall pay to Administrative Agent an amount equal to the applicable Letter of Credit Disbursement on the Business Day such Letter of Credit Disbursement is made and, in the absence of such payment, the amount of the Letter of Credit Disbursement immediately and automatically shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder and, initially, shall bear interest at the rate then applicable to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans. If a Letter of Credit Disbursement is deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder, the Borrowers obligation to pay the amount of such Letter of Credit Disbursement to Issuing Lender shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Revolving Loan. Promptly following receipt by Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrowers pursuant to this paragraph, Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Lender or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to Section 2.04(b) to reimburse the Issuing Lender, then to such Revolving Lenders and the Issuing Lender as their interests may appear. (b) Promptly following receipt of a notice of a Letter of Credit Disbursement pursuant to Section 2.04(a), each Revolving Lender agrees to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Revolving Loan deemed made pursuant to Section 2.04(a) on the same terms and conditions as if the Borrowers had requested the amount thereof as a Revolving Loan and Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to Issuing Lender the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Lender or the Revolving Lenders, the Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have granted to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, a participation in each Letter of Credit issued by Issuing Lender in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of such Letter of Credit, and each such Revolving Lender agrees to pay to Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, such Revolving Lender s Pro Rata Share of any Letter of Credit Disbursement made by Issuing Lender under the applicable Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, such Revolving Lender s Pro Rata Share of each Letter of Credit Disbursement made by Issuing Lender and not reimbursed by the Borrowers on the date due as provided in Section 2.04(a), or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrowers for any reason. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to deliver to Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, an amount equal to its respective Pro Rata Share of each Letter of Credit Disbursement pursuant to this Section 2.04(b) shall be absolute and unconditional and such remittance shall be made notwithstanding the occurrence or continuation of an Event of Default or Default or the failure to satisfy any condition set forth in Section 6. If any such Revolving Lender fails to make available to Administrative Agent the amount of such Revolving Lender s Pro Rata Share of a Letter of Credit Disbursement as provided in this Section, such Revolving Lender shall be deemed to be a Defaulted Lender and Administrative Agent (for the account of the Issuing Lender) shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Revolving Lender together with interest thereon at the Defaulted Lender Rate until paid in full. 
 63 

 (c) The Borrowers hereby agree to indemnify, save, defend, and hold the Lenders harmless from any damage, loss, cost, expense, or liability (other than Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 4.04, other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims or damages arising from any non-Tax claim), and reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees incurred by Issuing Lender, any other member of the Lenders arising out of or in connection with Letter of Credit; provided , however , that the Borrowers shall not be obligated hereunder to indemnify for any loss, cost, expense, or liability that a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender, any other Lender, or any dispute solely among the Issuing Lender or any other Lender. The Borrowers understand and agree that none of the Issuing Lender or the Lenders shall be liable for any error, negligence, or mistake, whether of omission or commission, in following the Borrowers instructions or those contained in the Letter of Credit or any modifications, amendments, or supplements thereto, unless such error, negligence or mistake resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender, or any other Lender as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Borrowers hereby acknowledge and agree that none of the Issuing Lender, or any other Lender shall be responsible for delays, errors, or omissions resulting from the malfunction of equipment in connection with any Letter of Credit, unless such delays, errors or omissions resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender, or any other Lender as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. (d) [reserved]. (e) Any and all issuance charges, usage charges, commissions, fees, and costs incurred by the Issuing Lender relating to Letters of Credit shall be expenses for purposes of this Agreement and shall be reimbursable immediately by the Borrowers to Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender; it being acknowledged and agreed by the Borrowers that, as of the Effective Date, the usage charge imposed by the Issuing Lender is one eighth of one percent (0.125 per annum times the undrawn amount of each Letter of Credit, that such usage charge may be changed from time to time, and that the Issuing Lender also imposes a schedule of charges for amendments, extensions, drawings, and renewals. (f) If by reason of (i) any change after the Effective Date in any applicable law, treaty, rule, or regulation or any change in the interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental Authority, or (ii) compliance by the Issuing Lender, or any other Lender with any direction, request, or requirement (irrespective of whether having the force of law) of any Governmental Authority or monetary authority including, Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Board as from time to time in effect (and any successor thereto): (i) any reserve, deposit, or similar requirement is or shall be imposed or modified in respect of any Letter of Credit issued or caused to be issued hereunder or hereby, or (ii) there shall be imposed on the Issuing Lender, or any other Lender any other condition regarding any Letter of Credit, and the result of the foregoing is to increase, directly or indirectly, the cost to the Issuing Lender, or any other Lender of issuing, making, guaranteeing, or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount receivable in respect thereof, then, and in any such case, Administrative Agent may, at any time within a reasonable period after the additional cost is incurred or the amount received is reduced, notify the Borrowers, and the Borrowers shall pay within thirty (30) days after demand therefor, such amounts as Administrative Agent may specify to be necessary to compensate the Issuing Lender, or any other Lender for such additional cost or reduced receipt, together with interest on such amount from the date of such demand until payment in full thereof at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder; provided , however , that the Borrowers shall not be required to provide any compensation pursuant to this 
 64 

 Section 2.04(f) for any such amounts incurred more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date on which the demand for payment of such amounts is first made to the Borrowers; provided , further , however , that if an event or circumstance giving rise to such amounts is retroactive, then the one hundred eighty (180) day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. The determination by Administrative Agent of any amount due pursuant to this Section 2.04(f), as set forth in a certificate setting forth the calculation thereof in reasonable detail, shall, in the absence of manifest or demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto. 2.05. [Intentionally Omitted] 2.06. Conversions . The Borrowers shall have the option to convert, on any Business Day, all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of Loans made pursuant to one or more Borrowings of one or more Types of Loans into a Borrowing of another Type of Loan; provided , that, (i) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.10(b), Term SOFR Loans may be converted into Base Rate Loans only on the last day of an Interest Period applicable to the Loans being converted, (ii) Base Rate Loans may not be converted into Term SOFR Loans if any Event of Default exists pursuant to Section 10 on the date of conversion, (iii) if any Event of Default (other than as referred to in preceding clause (ii)) is in existence on the date of the proposed conversion of a Term SOFR Loan, (x) Base Rate Loans may not be converted into Term SOFR Loans if the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders have notified the Borrowers that conversions will not be permitted during the existence of such Event of Default and (y) in the absence of the notification referred to in preceding clause (x), Base Rate Loans may only be converted into Term SOFR Loans with an Interest Period of one (1) month, and (iv) no conversion pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall result in more than six (6) Borrowings of Term SOFR Loans. Each such conversion shall be effected by the Borrowers by giving the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) at least (x) in the case of conversions of Base Rate Loans into Term SOFR Loans, three (3) Business Days prior notice and (y) in the case of conversions of Term SOFR Loans into Base Rate Loans, one Business Day s prior notice (each, a Notice of Conversion/Continuation ), in each case substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1, appropriately completed to specify the Loans to be so converted, the Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to which such Loans were incurred and, if to be converted into Term SOFR Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent shall give each Lender prompt notice of any such proposed conversion affecting any of its Loans. 2.07. [Intentionally Omitted]. 2.08. Interest . (a) The Borrowers agree to pay interest in respect of the unpaid principal amount of each Base Rate Loan from the date of Borrowing thereof until the earlier of (i) the maturity thereof (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and (ii) the conversion of such Base Rate Loan to a Term SOFR Loan pursuant to Sections 2.06 or 2.09 , as applicable, at a rate per annum which shall be equal to the sum of the relevant Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate, each as in effect from time to time. (b) The Borrowers agree to pay interest in respect of the unpaid principal amount of each Term SOFR Loan from the date of Borrowing thereof until the earlier of (i) the maturity thereof (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and (ii) the conversion of such Term SOFR Loan to a Base Rate Loan pursuant to Sections 2.06 , 2.09 or 2.10 , as applicable, at a rate per annum which shall, during each Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of the relevant Applicable Margin as in effect from time to time during such Interest Period plus Term SOFR for such Interest Period. (c) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under Sections 10.01 or 10.05 , overdue principal (and, after the occurrence and during the continuance of any 
 65 

 Event of Default, upon notification to the Administrative Borrower by the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders, all principal) in respect of each outstanding Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate which is 2.0 in excess of the rate otherwise applicable to such Loans. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) overdue interest in respect of each Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate which is 2.0 in excess of the rate then borne by such Loans and (ii) all other overdue amounts payable hereunder and under any other Credit Document shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate which is 2.0 in excess of the rate applicable to Revolving Loans that are maintained as Base Rate Loans from time to time. Interest that accrues under this Section 2.08(c) shall be payable promptly upon written demand. (d) Accrued (and theretofore unpaid) interest shall be payable: (i) (x) in respect of each Base Rate Loan, on the first calendar day of each quarter, as provided in Section 4.01 , and (y) in respect of each Term SOFR Loan, on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto and, in the case of an Interest Period in excess of three months, on each date occurring at three month intervals after the first day of such Interest Period; (ii) on the date of any repayment or prepayment, in full or in part, of any outstanding Loans; and (iii) at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, promptly upon demand. (e) The Administrative Agent shall determine the interest rate for each Interest Period applicable to the respective Term SOFR Loans and such determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto. 2.09. Interest Periods . At the time the Borrowers give any Notice of Conversion/Continuation in respect of the making of, or conversion into, any Term SOFR Loan (in the case of the initial Interest Period applicable thereto) or prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the expiration of an Interest Period applicable to such Term SOFR Loan (in the case of any subsequent Interest Period), the Borrowers shall have the right to elect the interest period (each, an Interest Period applicable to such Term SOFR Loan, which Interest Period shall, at the option of the Administrative Borrower, be a one (1), three (3) or six (6) month period; provided , that (in each case): (i) all Term SOFR Loans comprising a Borrowing shall at all times have the same Interest Period; (ii) the initial Interest Period for any Term SOFR Loan shall commence on the date of Borrowing of such Term SOFR Loan (including the date of any conversion thereto from a Term SOFR Loan) and each Interest Period occurring thereafter in respect of such Term SOFR Loan shall commence on the day on which the next preceding Interest Period applicable thereto expires; (iii) if any Interest Period for a Term SOFR Loan begins on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day of such calendar month; (iv) if any Interest Period for a Term SOFR Loan would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day; provided , however , that if any Interest Period for a Term SOFR Loan would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day; (v) if any Event of Default is in existence, (x) no Interest Period may be selected if the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders have notified the Administrative 
 66 

 Borrower that the selection of new Interest Periods will not be permitted during the existence of such Event of Default and (y) in the absence of the notification referred to in preceding clause (x), no Interest Period with a duration in excess of one (1) month may be selected; (vi) no Interest Period in respect of any Borrowing of Loans shall be selected which extends beyond the Maturity Date; and If by 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to a Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans, the Borrowers have failed to elect a new Interest Period to be applicable to such Term SOFR Loans as provided above, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have elected to continue such Term SOFR Loans as Term SOFR Loans with an Interest Period of one (1) month effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest Period; provided , that if the Borrowers are not permitted to elect a new Interest Period to be applicable to such Term SOFR Loans as provided above, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Term SOFR Loans into Base Rate Loans effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest Period. 2.10. Increased Costs, Illegality, etc. (a) In the event that any Lender shall have reasonably determined (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but, with respect to clause (i) or (iii)(z) below, may be made only by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders): (i) that, by reason of any changes arising after the date of this Agreement affecting any applicable interbank market, (y) adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition of Term SOFR and (y) and no Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with Section 2.14, and the circumstances under clause (i) of Section 2.14(a) or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred; or (ii) at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to any Term SOFR Loan because (x) of any Change in Law since the Effective Date such as, but not limited to: (A) a Change in Law, subjecting a Recipient to any Taxes (other than (1) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes, (2) Indemnified Taxes or (3) Connection Income Taxes) or (B) a change in official reserve requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves required under Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of Term SOFR and/or (y) Term SOFR with respect to such Term SOFR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lender of funding such Term SOFR Loan; or (iii) at any time, that the making or continuance of any Term SOFR Loan has been made (x) unlawful by any law or governmental rule, regulation or order, (y) impossible by compliance by any Lender in good faith with any governmental request (whether or not having force of law) or (z) impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the Effective Date which materially and adversely affects any applicable interbank market; then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the case of clause (i) above) shall promptly give notice (by telephone promptly confirmed in writing) to the Borrowers and, except in the case of clause (i) above, to the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders). Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, Term SOFR Loans shall no longer be available (and the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended) until such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative Agent no longer exist, and any Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by the Borrowers with respect to Term 
 67 

 SOFR Loans which have not yet been incurred (including by way of conversion) shall be deemed rescinded by the Borrowers, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the Borrowers agree, subject to the provisions of Section 2.11(b) (to the extent applicable), to pay to such Lender, within 10 Business Days of such Lender s written request therefor (including reasonably supporting documentation therefor), such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts received or receivable hereunder (a written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender, showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to the Borrowers by such Lender shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto) and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, the Borrowers shall take one of the actions specified in Section 2.10(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period required by law. (b) At any time that any Term SOFR Loan is affected by the circumstances described in Section 2.10(a)(ii), the Borrowers may, and in the case of a Term SOFR Loan affected by the circumstances described in Section 2.10(a)(iii), the Borrowers shall, either (x) if the affected Term SOFR Loan is then being made initially or pursuant to a conversion, cancel such Borrowing by giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed in writing) on the same date that the Borrowers were notified by the affected Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii) or (y) if the affected Term SOFR Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three (3) Business Days written notice to the Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender to convert such Term SOFR Loan into a Base Rate Loan; provided , that, if more than one Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders must be treated the same pursuant to this Section 2.10(b). (c) If any Lender determines that after the Effective Date the introduction of or any change in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline, directive or request (whether or not having the force of law) concerning capital adequacy or liquidity, or any change in interpretation or administration thereof by the NAIC or any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, will have the effect of increasing the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender based on the existence of such Lender s Commitments hereunder or its obligations hereunder, then the Borrowers agree to pay to such Lender, within 10 Business Days of its written demand (including documentation reasonably supporting such request) therefor, such additional amounts as shall be required to compensate such Lender or such other corporation for the increased cost to such Lender or such other corporation or the reduction in the rate of return to such Lender or such other corporation as a result of such increase of capital.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the Administrative Agent or a Lender be required to pay any amount pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent or such Lender would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.

SECTION 11. The Administrative Agent 11.01. Appointment . The Lenders (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to designate, appoint, and authorize) hereby irrevocably designate and appoint Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent (for purposes of this Section 11 and Section 12.01, the term Administrative Agent also shall include Bank of America, N.A. in its capacity as Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security Documents) to act as specified herein and in the other Credit Documents. Each Lender and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider hereby irrevocably authorizes, the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement, the other Credit Documents and any other instruments and agreements referred to herein or therein and to exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to or required of the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent may perform any of its respective duties hereunder by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it or through its Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Section 11 shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The provisions of this Section 11 are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider, and no Credit Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any such provisions. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agent except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agent. In performing its functions and duties hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall act solely as an agent of the Lenders and each Bank Product Provider and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for the Administrative Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Credit Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. Each Lender and each Bank Product Provider irrevocably appoints each other as its agent and bailee for the purpose of perfecting Liens (whether pursuant to Section 8-301(a)(2) of the UCC or otherwise), for the benefit of the Secured Creditors, in assets in which, in accordance with the UCC or any other applicable legal requirement a security interest can be perfected by possession or control. Should any Lender (other than the Collateral Agent) obtain possession or control of any such Collateral, such Lender shall notify the Collateral Agent thereof, and, promptly following the Collateral Agent s request therefor, shall deliver such Collateral to the Collateral Agent or otherwise deal with such Collateral in accordance with the Collateral Agent s instructions. 11.02. Nature of Duties . The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and in the other Credit Documents. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or omitted by it or 
 124 

 them hereunder or under any other Credit Document or in connection herewith or therewith (a) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 12.12) or (b) in the absence of its or their gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). The duties of the Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; the Administrative Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other Credit Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender or any Bank Product Provider; and nothing in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any other Credit Document except as expressly set forth herein or therein. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Credit Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 12.12); provided , that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability, if the Administrative Agent is not indemnified to its satisfaction, or that is contrary to any Credit Document or applicable legal requirements including, for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may affect a foreclosure, modification or termination of property of a Lender or Bank Product Provider in default under this Agreement under any Debtor Relief Law. 11.03. Lack of Reliance on the Administrative Agent. Independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, each Lender and each Bank Product Provider, to the extent it deems appropriate, has made and shall continue to make (i) its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the Administrative Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with the purchase of the Loan, the making and the continuance of the Loans and the taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith and (ii) its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of the Administrative Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries and, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender or any Bank Product Provider with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter. Each of the Lenders and each Bank Product Provider represents and warrants that it has reviewed each document made available to it on the Platform in connection with this Agreement and has acknowledged and accepted the terms and conditions applicable to the recipients thereof (including any such terms and conditions set forth, or otherwise maintained, on the Platform with respect thereto). None of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall be responsible to any Lender or any Bank Product Provider for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties herein or in any document, certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection, collectability, priority or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or the financial condition of the Administrative Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or the financial condition of the Administrative Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice describing such Default is given to such Person by the Administrative Borrower or a Lender. Each party to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may from time to time use one or more outside service providers for the tracking of all UCC financing statements (and/or other collateral related filings and registrations from time to time) required to be filed or recorded pursuant to the Credit Documents and the notification to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, of, among other 
 125 

 things, the upcoming lapse or expiration thereof, and that each of such service providers will be deemed to be acting at the request and on behalf of the Borrowers and the other Credit Parties. 11.04. Certain Rights of the Administrative Agent. If the Administrative Agent requests instructions from the Required Lenders with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received instructions from the Required Lenders; and the Administrative Agent shall not incur liability to any Lender or any Bank Product Provider by reason of so refraining. Without limiting the foregoing, neither any Lender nor any Bank Product Provider shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting hereunder or under any other Credit Document in accordance with the instructions of the Required Lenders. 11.05. Reliance . The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message, cablegram, radiogram, order or other document (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) or telephone message signed, sent or made by any Person that the Administrative Agent believed to be the proper Person, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and any other Credit Document and its duties hereunder and thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. 11.06. Indemnification . To the extent the Administrative Agent (or any Related Party thereof) is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Borrowers, the Lenders will reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any Related Party thereof) in proportion to their respective percentage as used in determining the Required Lenders as in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section 11.06 (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which all Commitments shall have terminated and all of the Obligations (other than inchoate indemnification obligations) shall have been paid in full, in proportion to their respective percentage as used in determining the Required Lenders as in effect immediately prior to such date) for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent (or any Related Party thereof) in performing its duties hereunder or under any other Credit Document or in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any other Credit Document or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein, the Transactions or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent or Related Party under or in connection with any of the foregoing IN ALL CASES, WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED OR ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OUT OF THE COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY OF ITS RELATED PARTIES ); provided , that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have directly resulted solely and directly from the Administrative Agent s or Related Party s, as the case may be, gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section 11.06 shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 11.07. The Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity .

Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not 
 143 

 affect the Borrowers obligations in respect of such Loans. The transfer of the Commitments of such Lender and the rights to the principal of, and interest on, any Loan made pursuant to such Commitments shall not be effective until such transfer is recorded on the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent with respect to ownership of such Commitments and Loans and prior to such recordation all amounts owing to the transferor with respect to such Commitments and Loans shall remain owing to the transferor.

No participation or grant to an SPV shall be effective unless it has been recorded in the Participant Register pursuant to this Section 12.15; provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Credit Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for or portion of the Loan (if funded by an SPV), all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 12.16. Confidentiality .

 counterparty s professional advisor), so long as such contractual counterparty (or such professional advisor) agrees in writing to be bound by the provisions of this Section 12.16, (vii) to any prospective or actual transferee or participant in connection with any contemplated transfer or participation of any of the Notes or Commitments or any interest therein by such Lender and (viii) to any rating agency when required by it; provided , that such prospective transferee or participant agrees in writing to be bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in this Section 12.16; provided , further , that, to the extent permitted pursuant to any applicable law, order, regulation or ruling, and other than in connection with credit and other bank examinations conducted in the ordinary course with respect to such Lender, in the case of any disclosure pursuant to the foregoing clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (vi) or (vii) such Lender will use its commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Administrative Borrower in advance of such disclosure so as to afford the Administrative Borrower the opportunity to protect the confidentiality of the Information proposed to be so disclosed. For the purposes of this Section 12.16, Information shall mean all information received from the Administrative Borrower and related to the Administrative Borrower or its business, other than any such information that was available to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to its disclosure by the Administrative Borrower. Any person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 12.16 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such person would accord to its own confidential information. (b) The Borrowers hereby acknowledge and agree that each Lender may share with any of its affiliates, and such affiliates may share with such Lender, any Information related to the Administrative Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, any non-public customer information regarding the creditworthiness of the Administrative Borrower and its Subsidiaries); provided , that such Persons shall be instructed to keep such Information confidential pursuant to the terms of this Section 12.16 to the same extent as such Lender. 12.17.

The parties hereto further acknowledge and agree that each Credit Party shall be required to take all actions under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Credit Party is organized to create and perfect all security interests (to the extent such security interests can be perfected by the filings or other actions required under the Security Documents) granted pursuant to the various Security Documents and to take all actions under the laws of the United States and any State thereof to perfect the security interests in the Equity Interests of, and promissory notes issued by, any Person organized under the laws of said jurisdictions (in each case, to the extent said Equity Interests or promissory notes are owned by any Credit Party). Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, to the extent any Security Document requires or provides for the pledge of promissory notes issued by, or Equity Interests in, any Person organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than those specified in the immediately preceding sentence, it is acknowledged that, as of the Effective Date, no actions have been required to be taken to perfect, under local law of the jurisdiction of the Person who issued the respective promissory notes or whose Equity Interests are pledged, under the Security Documents. The Administrative Borrower hereby agrees that, following any request by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders to do so, the Administrative Borrower will, and will cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take such actions under the local law of any jurisdiction with respect to which such actions have not already been taken as are determined by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders to be necessary or advisable in order to fully perfect (to the extent such security interests can be perfected by the filings or other actions required under the Security Documents), preserve or protect the security interests granted pursuant to the various Security Documents under the laws of such jurisdictions; provided , however , that 
 145 

 no such request shall be made by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders if the Collateral Agent determines in its Permitted Discretion that the costs of taking any such action are excessive in relation to the value of the security afforded thereby. If requested to do so pursuant to this Section 12.17, all such actions shall be taken in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.17 and Section 8.11 and within the time periods set forth therein.

Interest Rate Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Credit Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Credit Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the Maximum Rate ). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrowers.

 146 

 equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder. 12.21. FCC Ownership and Attribution Rules .

 147 

 in payments and collections out of the Collateral as more fully set forth herein. In addition, each Bank Product Provider, by virtue of entering into a Bank Product Agreement, shall be automatically deemed to have agreed that Administrative Agent shall have the right, but shall have no obligation, to establish, maintain, relax, or release reserves in respect of the Bank Product Obligations and that if reserves are established there is no obligation on the part of Administrative Agent to determine or insure whether the amount of any such reserve is appropriate or not. In connection with any such distribution of payments or proceeds of Collateral, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due or owing to any Bank Product Provider unless such Bank Product Provider has provided a written certification (setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation) to Administrative Agent as to the amounts that are due and owing to it and such written certification is received by Administrative Agent a reasonable period of time prior to the making of such distribution. Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to calculate the amount due and payable with respect to any Bank Products, but may rely upon the written certification of the amount due and payable from the relevant Bank Product Provider. In the absence of an updated certification, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that the amount due and payable to the relevant Bank Product Provider is the amount last certified to Administrative Agent by such Bank Product Provider as being due and payable (less any distributions made to such Bank Product Provider on account thereof). The Borrowers may obtain Bank Products from any Bank Product Provider, although the Borrowers are not required to do so. The Borrowers acknowledge and agree that no Bank Product Provider has committed to provide any Bank Products and that the providing of Bank Products by any Bank Product Provider is in the sole and absolute discretion of such Bank Product Provider.
