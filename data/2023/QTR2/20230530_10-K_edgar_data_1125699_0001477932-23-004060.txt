Throughout this document we may use the following terms: Aqualyte , ConsERV , NanoClear , PolyCool and NanoAir , all of which are unregistered trademarks of the Company. Overview Dais Corporation Dais , us, we, , the Company is a proprietary, nanotechnology polymer materials company. Nanotechnology involves studying and working with matter on an ultra-small scale. Doing this is where the Company built features and properties into its platform of nanomaterial sold under the brand name Aqualtye . Aqualyte is used to enable new product variants we believe are better than traditional products which use energy consuming and break-able components. Aqualyte itself, is marketed to OEMs to create differentiated products, while the second product is a fixed plate energy recovery ventilator called ConsERV, which we believe is useful in meeting building indoor fresh air requirements while saving energy and lowering emissions for most forms of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment. We continue to develop other nano-structured polymer technology applications in HVAC/Refrigeration, energy, food services and wastewater treatment industries. Corporate History We were incorporated as a New York corporation on April 8, 1993, as The Dais Corporation. The Company was formed to develop new, cost-effective polymer materials for various applications, including providing a lower cost membrane material for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane fuel cells. We believe our research on materials science has yielded technological advances in the field of selective ion transport polymer materials. In December 1999, the Company purchased the assets of Analytic Power Corporation, in March 2002, the Company sold substantially all its fuel cell assets to Chevron, a large U.S. oil company for a combination of cash and the assumption by such company of certain of the Company s obligations and began working to commercialize the attributes and features of the nanomaterials developed since formation. In November of 2018, the board of directors unanimously voted to change the name of the Company from Dais Analytic Corporation to Dais Corporation (the Name Change ). The Name Change took effect with FINRA on February 27, 2019. On November 2, 2018, the shareholders of the Company approved an increase in the authorized common shares of the company from 240,000,000 shares to 340,000,000 shares. On March 14, 2019, the shareholders approved an increase in authorized common shares from 340,000,000 shares to 1,100,000,000 shares. In July 2019, the shareholders of the Company approved a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock at the ratio ranging from one-for-500 to one-for-2,000. On October 31, 2019, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to reflect a one-for-2,000 reverse stock split of the Company s common stock. The reverse split was effective December 6, 2019. All share and per share data have been retroactively restated in this annual report and the accompanying financial statements and footnotes to reflect the effects of the reverse split. Our Technology We use proprietary nanotechnology to reformulate thermoplastic polymers. Nanotechnology involves studying and working with matter on an ultra-small scale. Polymers are chain-like plastic molecules used in diverse products such as Dacron, Teflon, and polyurethane. Thermoplastic is a plastic (deformable) polymer material that melts to a liquid when heated and solidifies when cooled and is able to transition repeatedly between these states. Our reformulated polymers have properties that allow them to be used in unique ways, and we call the resulting material Aqualyte . 4 Table of Contents The Company believes the attributes of its Aqualyte platform of nanomaterial create a catalyst for change: Consume less energy and release less CO 2 into the atmosphere Replace moving parts to increase operational lifetime Provide strong pathogen protection (COVID) and lower allergy/asthma triggers Reduce operating costs for increased ventilation rates shown in 3 rd party testing to improve cognitive performance by 101 on average. Extend useable life of food and other organic materials Clean most forms of contaminated wastewater to levels up to one-hundred times greater than noted in the Clean Water Act of 1970. Our Products The Company uses its knowledge of the Aqualyte nanomaterial to integrate it into traditional or new product form factors. It is management s belief based on 3 rd party industry or independent test results, the Company s own testing, or data from customer use, that the benefits address the growing market needs resulting from, but not limited to, the drivers of climate change as well as those needs created by the pandemic. Nanomaterial Platform - Aqualyte The Aqualyte Nanomaterial is made from commercially available polymer resin and industrial grade solvents which are mixed using a proprietary process with traditional industrial equipment. Our process creates a modified resin with key features and attributes that can be used to offer different properties to multiple products. The Company sells Aqualyte to skilled OEMs using its features and properties to create new and/or improved products in a range of applications. The Company continues to develop next generation versions of its Aqualyte nanomaterial working to increase existing performance, add new features, and improve cost. ConsERV We continue to expand sales channels to drive growth of revenues of our ConsERV product. ConsERV is an HVAC energy conservation product which should, according to various tests, save energy and operating costs on HVAC equipment, lower CO 2 emissions and allow HVAC systems to be 20 - 67 smaller, reducing peak energy usage while simultaneously improving indoor air quality. This product makes most forms of HVAC systems operate more efficiently. ConsERV generally works in combination with existing HVAC systems, to provide improved ventilation air in buildings. ConsERV uses a fixed-plate enthalpy exchanger (the core constructed with our nanotechnology polymer. When compared to similar competitive products, we believe, based on tests conducted by the Air-conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI), a leading industry association, ConsERV maintains an industry leading position in the management of latent heat. The Company began actively rolling out an updated ConsERV product line in 4Q, 2021. The updated line addresses market requested updates and features. The sales channels for ConsERV continue to expand across North America and include private labeling efforts. The Company has and continues to negotiate arrangements with independent sales/engineering representatives in multiple regions across North America who in turn target architects and specifying engineers, select OEMs, utility sponsored programs, and sophisticated users of HVAC equipment. We believe the growth initiatives and what we perceive as changes in the ERV market will allow the company to address well over fifty percent of the addressable North American market for ConsERV. We continue to have targeted discussions with identified companies in the European Union interested in buying and distributing both Aqualyte nanomaterial for use in their ERV cores as well as selling Dais produced ConsERV cores. To help us expand our capabilities in the reported high growth HVAC markets in Southeast Asia, Dais qualified a Chinese manufacturing company to produce ConsERV cores using Aqualyte membrane to meet the growing demand for ConsERV systems in the Region. The Company expects this trend of growing ConsERV system, core, and Aqualyte nanomaterial revenues to continue into 2023 and beyond. Dais continues to respond to market interests by developing additional products that use our nanotechnology to save energy, provide clean water, protect health, and generally promote a more sustainable future. Strategic Partnerships Currently the Company is engaged with a multi-national conglomerate developing a line of products within the Company s defined and proven uses of its nano polymer's capabilities, We expect, if all continues well, an uptick in revenues from this effort no later than the end of the 2 nd quarter of 2024. 5 Table of Contents Our Patents Dais has owned 25 granted patents over its corporate history, some of which have reached the end of their enforceable term. As of December 31, 2022, Dais owns the active, enforceable rights to eleven U.S. patents, five Chinese patents, two Hong Kong patents, and three Patent Cooperation Treaty PCT applications that are still being examined. These patents relate to, or are applications of, our nano-structured polymer materials that perform functions such as ion exchange and modification of surface properties. The company also owns multiple utility patents that cover inventions that are new, improvements and useful processes including the design and fabrication of devices or approaches that use properties of the polymers described above for HVAC, energy, food preservation, and water treatment applications. Dais owns the rights to a new US Patent issued in 2022: 1. U.S. Patent No. 11,331,628 Vapor condenser enhanced by membrane evaporation. This patent was issued May 17, 2022 and the patent term ends on or about August 29, 2038. 2. C.N. Patent No. 108,430,606B Evaporative chilling systems and methods using a selective transfer membrane. This patent was issued November 2, 2021, and the patent term ends on or about October 7, 2036. Dais has been notified that the following Application will be granted full US patent status in 2022: 1. US20200330923A1 Vapor condenser enhanced by membrane evaporation Additional patent applications are being examined that are not yet publicly visible in the patent system and will be revealed at the appropriate time. Patents may or may not be granted on any of the above applications. We also seek to protect our proprietary intellectual property, including intellectual property that may not be patented or patentable, in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our current and prospective strategic partners and employees. Manufacturing The Company currently uses a mix of in-house and outsourced assembles for its nanomaterial and product (ConsERV) needs. For future expansion and high-volume scale-up, the Company is actively looking at the costs and merits of organically scaling v. moving to a near 100 outsourced model at the most optimum way to grow. Nonetheless, the Company continues to strengthen its existing supply chain with strategic partners having existing multiple channel access to the ERV or OEM Aqualyte markets or with qualified outsourced firms. The Company has continued to establish a robust supply chain with strategic partners having existing multiple channel access to markets or with qualified outsourced firms. We do not have long-term contractual relationships with any of our manufacturers or vendors. There are no subassemblies or components that could not be purchased from alternative suppliers. Purchases to date of raw materials and related services have been on a purchase order basis using non-disclosure agreements. OEM Customers, and Suppliers Using the properties and features of its Aqualyte nanomaterial the Company has proven results in a variety of cross-industry markets. We look to provide Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) with Aqualyte membrane. Then sharing how to use the options and features found in Aqualyte, for the OEM to offer better or even new products in consumer, commercial, and industrial applications having what we believe to be better lifetimes, and efficiencies. We are dependent on third parties to manufacture the key components needed for our nano-structured based materials and of the value-added products made with these materials. We require our suppliers to provide components in a timely manner, and to meet the Company s quality, quantity and cost requirements or technical specifications with acceptable terms. Certain of the components or the processes of the Company s suppliers are proprietary. If the Company were ever required to replace any of its suppliers, it should be able to obtain comparable components from alternative suppliers at comparable costs, but this would create delays in production. 6 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenditures for research, development and engineering of products are expensed as incurred. We incurred research and development costs of 328,480 and 223,425 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We account for proceeds received from government funding for research as a reduction in research and development costs. We recorded proceeds against research and development expenses on the Statements of Operations of 0 and 89,617 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales and Marketing Strategies We have secured and continue to discuss relationships with leading industry HVAC manufacturers, HVAC product distributors, energy service companies, and ERV manufacturers outside of North and South America. In addition, we are discussing relationships for use of our ConsERV products in other applications outside of energy recovery ventilation world-wide. The Company is focused on creating alliances with companies having strong, existing channel presence or expertise in the target industries, notably for ConsERV and Aqualyte OEM uses. We are using the data and experience of past sales in a variety of markets, adding newer features and functions, working to increase revenues. We intend to bring industry seasoned talent into the Company at the appropriate time to further drive market development, revenue growth and guide future product feature improvement needs. Competition and Barriers to Entry We believe the efficacy of our value-added products and technology can capture increased market share, thus taking business away from more established firms using older technology. We believe our ConsERV product may become a functional component of newer, more efficient OEM products. A key challenge is to educate decision makers of the benefits derived from products using our materials and processes, and have qualified people and certified products which out-perform other products, diminishing the value proposition of competitive products in the various sales channels. As we continue to grow the base of operational and third-party data this education process will become routine. There are several companies located in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia that have been developing and selling technologies and products in the energy recovery industry as listed below. We will experience significant competition regarding our products because certain competing companies possess greater financial and personnel resources. Future product competitors include, but are not limited to: Products Current and Future Competitors ConsERV Semco, Greenheck, Venmar, Bry-Air, Fuwei, Ltd, CORE Energy Recovery Solutions, Renewaire, Holtop, Hoval, Klingenberg, Solar Palau, Kraton, Daikin and AirXchange. We believe the combination of our nanomaterial characteristics and growing patent positions form competitive advantages, which may allow us time to execute our business plan. Many of our competitors may experience barriers to entry in these markets primarily related to the lack of similarly performing proprietary materials and processes. 7 Table of Contents Government Regulation We do not believe the sale, installation or use of our current nano-structured products will be subject to any government regulation, other than perhaps adherence to building codes and water safety regulations. We do not believe that the cost of complying with such codes and regulations, to the extent applicable to our products, will be prohibitive. We do not know the extent to which any existing or new regulations may affect our ability to distribute, install and service any of our products. Once our other products reach the commercialization stage and we begin distributing them to our target markets, federal, state, or local governmental entities may seek to impose regulations. We are also subject to various international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, land use, safe working conditions, and environmental regulations regarding handling and disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous substances and emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. The process of manufacturing the solutions which are used to produce Aqualyte may expose us to the risk of harmful substances escaping into the environment, resulting in potential injury or loss of life, damage to property and natural resources. Depending on the nature of any claim, our current insurance policies may not adequately reimburse us for costs incurred in settling environmental damage claims and, in some instances, we may not be reimbursed at all. To date, we are not aware of any claims or liabilities under these existing laws and regulations that would materially affect our results of operations or financial condition. The completed products which use the Aqualyte material may have regulatory requirements relating to a variety of local or federal regulatory agencies, however, this type of exposure would be minimal. Employees As of December 31, 2022, we employed 21 full-time employees and one independent contractor. None of the employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. As of the date of filing the number of employees of the Company has increased to 23. Principal Offices Our principal office is located at 11552 Prosperous Drive, Odessa, FL 33556. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

We do not anticipate investing in real estate or interests in real estate, real estate mortgages, or securities of or interests in persons primarily engaged in real estate activities. We currently have no formal investment policy and do not intend to undertake investments in real estate as a part of our normal operations. 8 Table of Contents ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. From time to time, claims are made against us in the ordinary course of our business, which could result in litigation. Claims and associated litigation are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable outcomes could occur, such as monetary damages, fines, penalties, or injunctions prohibiting us from selling one or more products or engaging in other activities. The occurrence of an unfavorable outcome in any specific period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period or future periods.

OVERVIEW Overview Dais Corporation Dais , us, we, , the Company is a nanomaterial technology company developing and commercializing products using the nanomaterial called Aqualyte. The first commercial product is the Aqualyte nanomaterial itself. It is useful in managing moisture and key gases in a variety of cross-industry products. The second commercial product is called ConsERV, a fixed plate energy recovery ventilator which is useful in meeting building indoor fresh air requirements while saving energy and lowering emissions for most forms of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment. We continue to develop other Aqualyte uses in cross-industry applications, HVAC/Refrigeration, energy, etc. One area of focused attention has been development work on a variant of Aqualyte targeting surface treatments to potentially create a protective layer designed to inactivate human coronaviruses. 11 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2022 as compared with December 31, 2021 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain data derived from our Statements of Operations: For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 REVENUE Sales 1,077,058 372,506 Royalty and license fees 50,000 50,000 1,127,058 422,506 COST OF GOODS SOLD 977,518 267,837 GROSS MARGIN 149,540 154,669 OPERATING EXPENSES Research and development, net of government grant proceeds of 0 and 89,617 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively 328,480 133,808 Selling, general and administrative 1,668,389 1,958,560 TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES 1,996,869 2,092,368 LOSS FROM OPERATIONS (1,847,329 (1,937,699 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Interest expense (2,728,360 (2,065,593 Loss on legal judgement - (382,664 Forgiveness of debt income 124,126 146,685 Change in fair value of derivative - 2,241,678 Gain on extinguishment of debt - 1,148,554 TOTAL OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET (2,604,234 1,088,660 NET LOSS (4,451,563 (849,039 NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE, BASIC AND DILUTED (0.43 (0.15 WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING, BASIC AND DILUTED 10,448,440 5,734,795 Revenue We generate our revenues primarily from the sale of our ConsERV cores and systems, and our Aqualyte membrane. Product sales were 1,077,058 and 372,506 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 704,552 or 189 . This increase in product sales was primarily driven by an increase in sales of our ConsERV product line, offset by a decrease in Aqualyte only OEM sales. Revenues from royalty and license fees were 50,000 and 50,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 12 Table of Contents Cost of Sales Our cost of sales consists primarily of materials (including freight), direct labor, and outsourced manufacturing expenses incurred to produce our ConsERV cores and systems and Aqualyte membrane. Cost of goods sold were 977,518 and 267,837 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 709,681 or 265 . The increased cost is primarily due to increased product sales, labor costs, materials, and normal variances in costs between our product lines.. Supply Chain (Availability and Increased prices) and Tightening labor market (money and people) Current world-wide supply chain issues are impacting many industries, including those of the Company. The lead time for materials and components is increasing, resulting in longer delivery dates. Management is working with existing partners to identify multiple sources of materials and components so as not to rely heavily on one or two suppliers. Increasing crude oil prices is influencing the cost of resins, plastics and fuel. Shipping and trucking costs have increased while capacity has contracted. These issues are creating increased costs across industries and Management is evaluating its pricing and lead times regularly. The labor market is having an impact across industries as competition for workers is increasing. Management is working to anticipate workforce needs and planning accordingly. The Company is dependent on third parties to manufacture the key components needed for its nanostructured materials and some portions of the value-added products made with these materials. Accordingly, a suppliers failure to supply components in a timely manner, or to supply components that meet the Company s quality, quantity and cost requirements or technical specifications, or the inability to obtain alternative sources of these components on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, would create delays in production of the Company s products and/or increase its unit costs of production. Certain of the components or the processes of the Company s suppliers are proprietary. If the Company was ever required to replace any of its suppliers, it should be able to obtain comparable components from alternative suppliers at comparable costs, but this would create a delay in production and may briefly affect the Company s operations. Covid-19 World-wide Pandemic Management continues to monitor the after effects the pandemic across the globe. As creative solutions to protect us from future infections the Company hasdeveloped what we believe using our technology is a uniquely positioned product designed to provide a positive health supporting solution to the existing or similar possible future pandemics (virus or bacteria). We believe the integration of this newer solution, once development is complete, fits well to support even higher emphasis on the need for high efficiency ventilation which itself appears to management to be a lesson learned from the COVID19 pandemic Management is developing and plans to soon execute crease a program to focus on the integration of high efficiency ventilation and a industry-setting use of the company s known features/benefits using its platform of nanomaterial. The plan is being formulated, will use, at a minimum, the existing sales channels to create what we believe is yet another benefit which finds ConsERV the best ventilation product in most instances. Climate Change and Carbon Reduction Countries and corporations around the world are adopting aggressive plans to achieve newly established Carbon Neutral goals by 2030 and 2050. This worldwide effort is attracting attention to innovative technologies which reduce carbon emissions. Management is confident in the successful track record of current products, with a history of increasing the efficiency of HVAC systems and reducing CO 2 emissions should drive increased business activity. Dais is actively involved in preparing its existing and planned products and those products we are working on with partners, to fully participate in the decarbonization of business. The Company s goal is to incorporate novel features of its nanomaterial platform to enable evolutionary or industry changing products. This is accomplished by replacing energy consuming, emissions creating product components (pumps, motors, gases, forever chemical laden items, etc.) with products made using an architecture best managing the features of the Company s platform of nanomaterial having higher efficiencies, lower emissions, longer life, fewer breakdown, gentle on the environment, good for your health and productivity. 13 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenditures for research, development and engineering of products are expensed as incurred. We incurred research and development costs of 328,480 and 223,425 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 105,055 or 47 . We account for proceeds received from government funding for research as a reduction in research and development costs. We recorded proceeds against research and development expenses on the Statements of Operations of 0 and 89,617 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a decrease of 89,617 or 100 . The decrease in proceeds from government funding was due to the completion of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1,000,000, Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award ending in the third quarter of 2021. Selling, General and Administrative Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related benefits, share-based compensation, professional fees, marketing and channel support costs, and other infrastructure costs such as insurance, information technology and occupancy expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 1,668,389 and 1,958,560 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a decrease of 290,171 or 15 . Our selling, general and administrative expenses may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: Additional expenses because of being an SEC reporting company including, but not limited to, director and officer insurance, director fees, SEC compliance expenses, transfer agent fees, additional staffing, professional fees, and similar expenses; Additional infrastructure needed to support the expanded commercialization of our ConsERV products and/or new product applications of our polymer technology for, among other things, administrative personnel, physical space, marketing and channel support and information technology; and The issuance and recognition of expense related to fair value of new share-based awards, which is based on various assumptions including, among other things, the volatility of our stock price. The 15 decrease in selling general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 resulted primarily from a decrease in stock-based compensation offset by increased payroll costs. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 2,728,360 compared to an expense of 2,065,593 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Change in fair value of derivative was 0 in 2022 compared to a gain of 2,241,678 in 2021 and there was a decrease in gain on extinguishing debt from 1,148,554 in 2021 to 0 in 2022. The gain on extinguishing debt in 2021 was due to the settlement of our convertible notes payable. Net Loss Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 4,451,563 compared to a net loss of 849,039 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increased net loss in 2022 was primarily due to the change in fair value of derivatives and the settlement of our convertible notes payable in 2021. 14 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated a net loss of 4,451,563 and has incurred significant losses since inception. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has an accumulated deficit of 62,274,665, total stockholders deficit of 12,430,988, negative working capital of 12,468,216 and cash and cash equivalents of 27,412. The Company used 1,451,315 and 1,283,772 of cash for operations during the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, which was funded primarily by proceeds from loans from related parties and others. There is no assurance that any such financing will be available in the future. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is currently pursuing the following sources of short and long-term working capital: 1. The Company guided by its Financial Advisors is actively working with targeted third parties who have or are interested in licensing, purchasing the rights to, or establishing a joint venture to commercialize applications of the Company s technology; 2. The Company continues to seek capital from key strategic and/or government (grant) related sources. These sources may, pursuant to any agreements that may be developed in conjunction with such funding, assist in the product definition and design, roll-out, and channel penetration of products; 3. The Company is actively working with newer investors, private equity companies, purchase order financing parties, and its existing debt holders to restructure its existing debt and obtain short and long-term working and growth capital; and, 4. The Company may license or sell an asset to fund its continued growth as it is clear to management the market for the Company s product innovations has changed in a positive way as demonstrated by the interest the Company s nano-material and applications in certain markets. Management believes: 1. The Company s ability to solve continuing supply chain issues and raise sustainable growth capital will dictate future revenue and cash-flow for the Company. The quicker these issues are resolved we believe the faster the Company can participate in the market s uptick momentum and follow the projected growth curve. These issues place heavy pressure on management to progress in key business areas being impacted. Continued supply chain impacts has roots in the funding challenges. The use of funds from affordable growth capital to resolve inventory levels of hard to acquire parts could be achieved within one quarter. Raising affordable capital is tied to addressing/fixing convertible debt transactions (recently found to be criminally usurious - (Adar v. Geneysy, LLC) used in the past to grow the Company with a plan to replace this convertible debt with lower cost funds. The Company has made progress yet still faces a worldwide public market in turmoil since February of 2022. In the intertest of expediting this situation the Company is seeking affordable public, and non-public, growth resources, with Board approval, is seeking to monetize one asset via a license/supply agreement. Such a plan (monetize an asset) will require approval by the Company s Senior Secured Noteholder. 2. The Senior Secured Note Holder has advised Management it is exploring its options to resolve the long standing unpaid and growing debt by the Company. 3. Ventilation is regularly recommended as one of the solutions to Covid related mitigation and the market awareness for the ConsERV product(s) is increasing and lead activity is encouraging. 4. We believe our current cash position and our projected ability to obtain additional sources of growth capital, and to generate sustainable cash flow from operations and investments into 2023 is improving yet remains challenged. We believe the Company s prospects to secure growth funding are good. The company has shown solid progress over the last three quarters, removed a serious impediment to growth by completing a debt to equity program where the convertible noteholders debt positions were converted into equity (common stock and warrants). The company introduced a popular new line of our ConsERV equipment having improved performance and pricing to a growing independent sales channel through-out North America. We reached agreement (now moving to contract stage) in late 4Q 2022 between the company and its Senior Secured Note Holder (having deep rights with the assets of the Company which are pledged as security for repayment of the Note). The company is continuing to develop the basis of a long term business relationship with a well-known, multi-national corporation interested in using the Company s products for its own and third-party use. There are no assurances we will be able to obtain the financing and planned product development commercialization. Accordingly, we may not have the ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 15 Table of Contents Statements of Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 were 27,412 compared to 773,423 as of December 31, 2021. Cash is primarily used to fund our working capital requirements. Net cash used in operating activities was 1,451,315and 1,283,772 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in net cash used in operations was primarily due to a decrease in cash from net working capital accounts partially offset by a decrease in net loss (after adjusting for non-cash items).

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. When making these estimates and assumptions, we consider our historical experience, our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on Form 10-K. The following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements: Revenue Recognition Generally, we recognize revenue for products upon shipment to customers, provided no significant obligations remain and collection is probable. In certain instances, our ConsERV system product may carry a limited warranty of up to two years for all parts contained therein except for the energy recovery ventilator core produced and sold by us. The distributor of the ConsERV system may carry a limited warranty of up to ten years. The limited warranty includes replacement of defective parts for the ConsERV system and includes workmanship and material failure for the ConsERV core. We have recorded an accrual of 91,531 for future warranty expenses on December 31, 2022, which is included in accrued expenses, other.

The Company analyzes its contracts to assess that they are within the scope and in accordance with ASC 606. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, whether for goods and services or licensing, the Company performs the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations based on estimated selling prices; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company acts as a principal in its revenue transactions as the Company is the primary obligor in the transactions. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue for its products upon shipment to customers, provided no significant obligations remain and collection is probable. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable consist primarily of receivables from the sale of our ERV products and Aqualyte membrane. We regularly review accounts receivables for any bad debts based on an analysis of our collection experience, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on management s review of accounts receivable, an allowance for doubtful accounts of 0 and 0 has been recorded on December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable. We periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment. When impairment indicators exist, we use market quotes, if available, or an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life in measuring whether the asset values are recoverable. We did not recognize impairment on its long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. Identified intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Our existing intangible assets consist solely of patents. Patents are amortized over their estimated useful or economic lives of 17 years. Patent amortization expense was 19,989and 18,885 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on current capitalized costs, total patent amortization expense is estimated to be approximately 20,000 per year for the next five years and thereafter. Stock-Based Compensation We recognize all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) or immediately if the share-based payments vest immediately. 18 Table of Contents There were no stock options issued during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Derivative Financial Instruments We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposure to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risk. Terms of convertible promissory note instruments are reviewed to determine whether they contain embedded derivative instruments that are required under ASC 815 Derivative and Hedging (ASC 815) to be accounted for separately from the host contract and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair value of derivative liabilities, if any, is required to be revalued at each reporting date, with corresponding changes in fair value recorded in current period operating results. Freestanding warrants issued by us in connection with the issuance or sale of debt and equity instruments are considered to be derivative instruments and are evaluated and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC 815. Pursuant to ASC 815, an evaluation of specifically identified conditions is made to determine whether fair value of warrants issued is required to be classified as equity or as a derivative liability. Income Taxes Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes resulting from temporary differences. Such temporary differences result from differences in the carrying value of assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. We identify and evaluate uncertain tax positions, if any, and recognize the impact of uncertain tax positions for which there is a less than more-likely-than-not probability of the position being upheld when reviewed by the relevant taxing authority. Such positions are deemed to be unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding liability is established on the balance sheet. We have not recognized a liability for uncertain tax positions. If there were an unrecognized tax benefit, we would recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. The Company s 2018-2021 tax years remain open and subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)). Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Management s assessment was based on criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system were met as a result of limited resources, and a lack of segregation of duties. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process, including policies and procedures, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Based on the results of this assessment, our management concluded that the Company s existing internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as defined in Rule 12a-15(f) under the Exchange act as of December 31, 2022 as a result of limited resources, and a lack of segregation of duties. Auditor s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this Annual Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Board Meetings and Committees; Annual Meeting Attendance Although we intend to establish an audit committee and compensation committee, our board of directors has not adopted any committees to the board of directors.

Other proceedings of the board of directors were conducted by resolutions consented to in writing by all the directors and filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the directors.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS; AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE. Tim Tangredi, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, is a founder and a member of the board of directors of Aegis Biosciences, LLC Aegis ). Mr. Tangredi currently owns 52 of Aegis outstanding equity and spends approximately one week per year on Aegis business for which he is compensated by Aegis. Aegis has two exclusive, world-wide licenses from us under which it has the right to use and sell products containing our polymer technologies in biomedical and health care applications.

On June 24, 2016, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement Security Agreement with Patricia Tangredi (the Holder pursuant to which the Company issued a Senior Secured Promissory Note for 150,000 (the Note ). The interest rate is 12 per annum compounded daily with a minimum interest payment of 2,000. The Note grants the Holder a secured interest in the assets of the Company. Ms. Tangredi is the wife of Tim N. Tangredi, the Company s CEO and stockholder, and therefore is a related party of the Company. Pursuant to the Note, the Company is to pay the Holder the principal amount of 150,000 plus all interest due thereon in accordance with terms and conditions of the Security Agreement on the earlier of: (i) the date upon which the Company secures funds, regardless of source, equal to or exceeding, in the aggregate, 1,000,000 or (ii) October 31, 2016 (the Maturity Date ).

Pursuant to the amendments, the principal amount due was increased to 2,400,499 and interest owed of 3,029,162 with an extension of the maturity date in negations between the Company and the Secured Noteholder. 26 Table of Contents Employment Agreements We entered into the following employment agreements with our officers and significant employees: Tim Tangredi - President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, which was amended and restated on September 14, 2011, and subsequently on February 27, 2015.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company has an accumulated deficit of , total stockholders deficit of , negative working capital of and cash and cash equivalents of . The Company used and of cash for operations during the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, which was funded primarily by proceeds from loans from related parties and others. There is no assurance that any such financing will be available in the future. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is currently pursuing the following sources of short and long-term working capital: 1. The Company guided by its Financial Advisors is actively working with targeted third parties who have or are interested in licensing, purchasing the rights to, or establishing a joint venture to commercialize applications of the Company s technology; 2. The Company continues to seek capital from key strategic and/or government (grant) related sources. These sources may, pursuant to any agreements that may be developed in conjunction with such funding, assist in the product definition and design, roll-out, and channel penetration of products; 3. The Company is actively working with newer investors, private equity companies, purchase order financing parties, and its existing debt holders to restructure its existing debt and obtain short and long-term working and growth capital; and, 4. The Company may license or sell an asset to fund its continued growth as it is clear to management the market for the Company s product innovations has changed in a positive way as demonstrated by the interest the Company s nano-material and applications in certain markets. Management believes: 1. The Company s ability to solve continuing supply chain issues and raise sustainable growth capital will dictate future revenue and cash-flow for the Company. The quicker these issues are resolved we believe the faster the Company can participate in the market s uptick momentum and follow the projected growth curve. These issues place heavy pressure on management to progress in key business areas being impacted. Continued supply chain impacts has roots in the funding challenges. The use of funds from affordable growth capital to resolve inventory levels of hard to acquire parts could be achieved within one quarter. Raising affordable capital is tied to addressing/fixing convertible debt transactions (recently found to be criminally usurious - (Adar v. Geneysy, LLC) used in the past to grow the Company with a plan to replace this convertible debt with lower cost funds. The Company has made progress yet still faces a worldwide public market in turmoil since February of 2022. In the intertest of expediting this situation the Company is seeking affordable public, and non-public, growth resources, with Board approval, is seeking to monetize one asset via a license/supply agreement. Such a plan (monetize an asset) will require approval by the Company s Senior Secured Noteholder. 2. The Senior Secured Note Holder has advised Management it is exploring its options to resolve the long standing unpaid and growing debt by the Company. 3. Ventilation is regularly recommended as one of the solutions to Covid related mitigation and the market awareness for the ConsERV product(s) is increasing and lead activity is encouraging. 4. We believe our current cash position and our projected ability to obtain additional sources of growth capital, and to generate sustainable cash flow from operations and investments into 2023 is improving yet remains challenged.
