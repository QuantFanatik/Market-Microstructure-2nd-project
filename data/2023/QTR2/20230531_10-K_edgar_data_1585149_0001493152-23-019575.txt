Description
of Business 

Dengfeng
Group Limited the Company , we us was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on
April 16, 2013. The Company was originally formed to commence operations in the business of placing and operating coin operated machines.
The Company has not generated any revenue since inception. 

On
March 23, 2015, Artem Rusakov sold 8,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, representing all of the shares of the Company s
common stock owned by Artem Rusakov, to Eastwin Capital Pte Ltd Eastwin ). A change in control of Romulus occurred upon
the transfer of approximately 72.59 of the ownership of Romulus from Artem Rusakov to Eastwin. 

Also
on March 23, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization pursuant to which its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Romulus Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated on March 20, 2015, will merge with and into Natural Resources Corporation,
a Delaware corporation NRC ), as a result of which, NRC will be the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company. In the aggregate, holders of the shares of NRC s common stock will receive approximately 124,000,000 common shares
of the Company in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of NRC s common stock. As a result of the Merger, NRC became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company. 

The
Company has been dormant since May 9, 2016. 

On
November 30, 2020, as a result of a receivership in Clark County, Nevada, Case Number: A-20-816623-B, Custodian Ventures LLC Custodian was appointed receiver of the Company.

On
September 24, 2021, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to reverse split its common stock at a rate of 1 for 100. 

Competition
and Market Conditions 

We
will face substantial competition in our efforts to identify and pursue a business venture. The primary source of competition is expected
to be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, including small venture capital firms, blank check companies, and
wealthy investors, many of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In light of our limited financial
and human resources, we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many of our competitors in our efforts to obtain an operating business
or assets necessary to commence our operations in a new field. Additionally, with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic,
many venture capital firms and similar firms and individuals have been seeking to acquire businesses at discounted rates, and we therefore
currently face additional competition and resultant difficulty obtaining a business. We expect these conditions to persist at least until
the economy recovers. Further, even if we are successful in obtaining a business or assets for new operations, we expect there to be
enhanced barriers to entry in the marketplace in which we decide to operate as a result of reduced demand and/or increased raw material
costs caused by the pandemic and other economic forces that are beyond our control. 

1 

Regulation 

As
of the date of this Report, we are required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC by Section
13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). 

Depending
on the direction management decides to take and a business or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may become subject to other
laws or regulations that require us to make material expenditures on compliance including the increasing state-level regulation of privacy.
Any such requirements could require us to divert significant human and capital resources on compliance, which could have an adverse effect
on our future operating results. 

Employees 

As
of the date of this Report, we do not have employees. However, an entity controlled by our Chief Executive Officer provides part-time
consulting services to us without compensation. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Risks
Relating to Our Business and Financial Condition 

We
currently have no operations, and investors therefore have no basis on which to evaluate the Company s future prospects. 

We
currently have no operations and will be reliant upon a merger with or acquisition of an operating business to commence operations and
generate revenue. Because we have no operations and have not generated revenues, investors have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability
to achieve our business objective of locating and completing a business combination with a target business. We have no current arrangements
or understandings with any prospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete a business combination
in a reasonable timeframe, on reasonable terms, or at all. If we fail to complete a business combination as planned, we will never generate
any operating revenues. 

We
may face difficulties or delays in our search for a business combination, and we may not have access to sufficient capital to consummate
a business combination. 

We
may face difficulty identifying a viable business opportunity or negotiating or paying for any resulting business combination. Economic
factors that are beyond our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent economic downturn, as well as increased competition
for acquisitions of operating entities that we expect to encounter as a result thereof, may hinder our efforts to locate and/or obtain
a business that is suitable for our business goals at a price we can afford and on terms that will enable us to sufficiently grow our
business to generate value to our shareholders. We have limited capital, and we may not be able to take advantage of any available business
opportunities on favorable terms or at all due to the limited availability of capital. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient
capital to provide us with the necessary funds to successfully develop and implement our plan of operation or acquire a business we deem
to be appropriate or necessary to accomplish our objectives, in which case we may be forced to terminate our business plan and your investment
in the Company could become worthless. 

If
we are not successful in acquiring a new business and generating material revenues, investors will likely lose their investment. 

If
we are not successful in developing a viable business plan and acquiring a new business through which to implement it, our investors 
entire investment in the Company could become worthless. Even if we are successful in combining with or acquiring the assets of an operating
entity, we can provide no assurances that the Company will be able to generate significant revenue therefrom in the short-term or at
all or that investors will derive a profit from their investment. If we are not successful, our investors will likely lose their entire
investment. 

If
we cannot manage our growth effectively, we may not become profitable. 

Businesses,
including development-stage companies such as ours and/or any operating business or businesses we may acquire, often grow rapidly and
tend to have difficulty managing their growth. If we are able to acquire an operating business, we will likely need to expand our management
team and other key personnel by recruiting and employing experienced executives and key employees and/or consultants capable of providing
the necessary support. 

We
cannot assure you that our management will be able to manage our growth effectively or successfully. Our failure to meet these challenges
could cause us to lose money, and your investment could be lost. 

Because
we have limited capital, we may need to raise additional capital in the future by issuing debt or equity securities, the terms of which
may dilute our current investors and/or reduce or limit their liquidation or other rights. 

We
may require additional capital to acquire a business. We may not be able to obtain additional capital when required. Future business
development activities, as well as administrative expenses such as salaries, insurance, general overhead, legal and compliance expenses,
and accounting expenses will require a substantial amount of additional capital. The terms of securities we issue in future capital raising
transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include liquidation preferences, superior voting rights or the issuance
of other derivative securities, which could have a further dilutive effect on or subordinate the rights of our current investors. Any
additional capital raised through the sale of equity securities will likely dilute the ownership percentage of our shareholders. Additionally,
any debt securities we issue would likely create a liquidation preference superior that of our current investors and, if convertible
into shares of Common Stock, would also pose the risk of dilution. 

2 

We
may be unable to obtain necessary financing if and when required. 

Our
ability to obtain financing, if and when necessary, may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets (both in general and in the
particular industry or industries in which we may choose to operate), our limited operating history and current lack of operations, the
national and global economies, and the condition of the market for microcap securities. Further, economic downturns such as the current
global depression caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may increase our requirements for capital, particularly if such economic downturn persists
for an extended period of time or after we have acquired an operating entity, and may limit or hinder our ability to obtain the funding
we require. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with any revenues we may generate from
future operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may be required to discontinue our development or implementation
of a business plan, cancel our search for business opportunities, cease our operations, divest our assets at unattractive prices or obtain
financing on unattractive terms. If any of the foregoing should happen, our shareholders could lose some or all of their investment. 

Because
we are still developing our business plan, we do not have any agreement for a business combination. 

We
have no current arrangement, agreement or understanding with respect to engaging in a business combination with any specific entity.
We may not be successful in identifying and evaluating a suitable acquisition candidate or in consummating a business combination. We
are neutral as to what industry or segment for any target company. We have not established specific metrics and criteria we will look
for in a target company, and if and when we do we may face difficulty reaching a mutual agreement with any such entity, including in
light of market trends and forces beyond our control. Given our early-stage status, there is considerable uncertainty and therefore inherent
risk to investors that we will not succeed in developing and implementing a viable business plan. 

The
COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition, future plans and results of operations. 

This
COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse effect on the economy in the United States and on most businesses. The Company is not
able to predict the ultimate impact that COVID -19 will have on its business; however, if the pandemic and government action in response
thereto impose limitations on our operations or result in a prolonged economic recession or depression, the Company s development
and implementation of its business plan and our ability to commence and grow our operations, as well as our ability to generate material
revenue therefrom, will be hindered, which would have a material negative impact on the Company s financial condition and results
of operations. 

Because
we are dependent upon Chan Yit Wei, our Chief Executive Officer and sole director to manage and oversee our Company, the loss of him
could adversely affect our plan and results of operations. 

We
currently have a sole director and officer, Chan Yit Wei, who manages the Company and is presently evaluating a viable plan for our future
operations. We will rely solely on his judgment in connection with selecting a target company and the terms and structure of any resulting
business combination. The loss of our Chief Executive Officer, could delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives, which
could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial position. Further, because Mr. Chan serves as Chief
Executive Officer and sole director and also holds a controlling interest in the Company s Common Stock, our other shareholders
will have limited ability to influence the Company s direction or management. 

In
addition, although not likely, the officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of a combination with
their business. The departure of a target s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and prospects of our post-combination
business. The role of a target s key personnel upon the completion of the transaction cannot be ascertained at this time. Although
we contemplate that certain or all members of a target s management team may remain associated with the target following a change
of control thereof, there can be no assurance that all of such target s management team will decide to remain in place. The loss
of key personnel, either before or after a business combination and including management of either us or a combined entity could negatively
impact the operations and profitability of our business. 

Risks
Related to a Potential Business Acquisition 

We
may encounter difficulty locating and consummating a business combination, including as a result of the competitive disadvantages we
have. 

We
expect to face intense competition in our search for a revenue-producing business to combine with or acquire. Given the current economic
climate, venture capital firms, larger companies, blank check companies such as special purpose acquisition companies and other investors
are purchasing operating entities or the assets thereof in high volumes and at relatively discounted prices. These parties may have greater
capital or human resources than we do and/or more experience in a particular industry within which we choose to search. Most of these
competitors have a certain amount of liquid cash available to take advantage of favorable market conditions for prospective business
purchaser such as those caused by the recent pandemic. Any delay or inability to locate, negotiate and enter into a business combination
as a result of the relative illiquidity of our current asset or other disadvantages we have relative to our competitors could cause us
to lose valuable business opportunities to our competitors, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

We
may expend significant time and capital on a prospective business combination that is not ultimately consummated. 

The
investigation of each specific target business and any subsequent negotiation and drafting of related agreements, SEC disclosure and
other documents will require substantial amounts of management s time and attention and material additional costs in connection
with outsourced services from accountants, attorneys, and other professionals. We will likely expend significant time and resources searching
for, conducting due diligence on, and negotiating transaction terms in connection with a proposed business combination that may not ultimately
come to fruition. In such event, all of the time and capital resources expended by the Company in such a pursuit may be lost and unrecoverable
by the Company or its shareholders. Unanticipated issues which may be beyond our control or that of the seller of the applicable business
may arise that force us to terminate discussions with a target company, such as the target s failure or inability to provide adequate
documentation to assist in our investigation, a party s failure to obtain required waivers or consents to consummate the transaction
as required by the inability to obtain the required audits, applicable laws, charter documents and agreements, the appearance of a competitive
bid from another prospective purchaser, or the seller s inability to maintain its operations for a sufficient time to allow the
transaction to close. Such risks are inherent in any search for a new business and investors should be aware of them before investing
in an enterprise such as ours. 

3 

Conflicts
of interest may arise between us and our shareholders, directors, or management, which may have a negative impact on our ability to consummate
a business combination or favorable terms or generate revenue. 

Our
Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Chan, is not required to commit his full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest
in allocating his time between managing the Company and other businesses in which he is or may be involved. We do not intend to have
any employees prior to the consummation of a business combination. Mr. Chan is not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours
to our affairs, and he may engage in other business endeavors while he provides consulting services to the Company. If any of his other
business affairs require him to devote substantial amounts of time to such matters, it could materially limit his ability to devote his
time and attention to our business which could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate a business combination or generate
revenue. 

It
is possible that we obtain an operating company in which a director or officer of the Company has an ownership interest in or that he
or she is an officer, director, or employee of. If we do obtain any business affiliated with an officer or director, such business combination
may be on terms other than what would be arrived at in an arms-length transaction. If any conflict of interest arises, it could adversely
affect a business combination or subsequent operations of the Company, in which case our shareholders may see diminished value relative
to what would have been available through a transaction with an independent third party. 

We
may engage in a business combination that causes tax consequences to us and our shareholders. 

Federal
and state tax consequences will, in all likelihood, be a significant factor in considering any business combination that we may undertake.
Under current federal law, such transactions may be subject to significant taxation to the buyer and its shareholders under applicable
federal and state tax laws. While we intend to structure any business combination so as to minimize the federal and state tax consequences
to the extent practicable in accordance with our business objectives, there can be no assurance that any business combination we undertake
will meet the statutory or regulatory requirements of a tax-free reorganization or similar favorable treatment or that the parties to
such a transaction will obtain the tax treatment intended or expected upon a transfer of equity interests or assets. A non-qualifying
reorganization, combination or similar transaction could result in the imposition of significant taxation, both at the federal and state
levels, which may have an adverse effect on both parties to the transaction, including our shareholders. 

It
is unlikely that our shareholders will be afforded any opportunity to evaluate or approve a business combination. 

It
is unlikely that our shareholders will be afforded the opportunity to evaluate and approve a proposed business combination. In most cases,
business combinations do not require shareholder approval under applicable law, and our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws do not afford
our shareholders with the right to approve such a transaction. Further, Mr. Chan, our Chief Executive Officer and sole director, owns
the vast majority of our outstanding Common Stock. Accordingly, our shareholders will be relying almost exclusively on the judgement
of our board of directors Board and Chief Executive Officer and any persons on whom they may rely with respect to a potential
business combination. In order to develop and implement our business plan, may in the future hire lawyers, accountants, technical experts,
appraisers, or other consultants to assist with determining the Company s direction and consummating any transactions contemplated
thereby. We may rely on such persons in making difficult decisions in connection with the Company s future business and prospects.
The selection of any such persons will be made by our Board, and any expenses incurred or decisions made based on any of the foregoing
could prove to be adverse to the Company in hindsight, the result of which could be diminished value to our shareholders. 

Because
our search for a business combination is not presently limited to a particular industry, sector or any specific target businesses, prospective
investors will be unable to evaluate the merits or risks of any particular target business s operations until such time as they
are identified and disclosed. 

We
are still determining the Company s business plan, and we may seek to complete a business combination with an operating entity
in any number of industries or sectors. Because we have not yet entered into any letter of intent or agreement to acquire a particular
business, prospective investors currently have no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target business s
operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition, prospects or other metrics or qualities they deem appropriate
in considering to invest in the Company. Further, if we complete a business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent
in the operations of the business we acquire. For example, if we acquire a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established
operating history, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a new business or a development stage entity.
Although our management intends to evaluate and weigh the merits and risks inherent in a particular target business and make a decision
based on the Company and its shareholders interests, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all the
significant risks inherent in a target business, that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence or that we will ultimately
acquire a viable business and generate material revenue therefrom. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and
leave us with no ability to reduce the likelihood that those risks will adversely impact a target business or mitigate any harm to the
Company caused thereby. Should we select a course of action, or fail to select a course of action, that ultimately exposes us to unknown
or unidentified risks, our business will be harmed and you could lose some or all of your investment. 

Past
performance by our management and their affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us. 

While
our Chief Executive Officer has prior experience in advising businesses, his past performance, the performance of other entities or persons
with which he is involved, or the performance of any other personnel we may retain in the future will not necessarily be an indication
of either (i) that we will be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) the future operating results
of the Company including with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of
him or any other of our personnel or their affiliates performance as indicative of our future performance or that an investment
in us will be profitable. In addition, an investment in the Company is not an investment in any entities affiliated with our management
or other personnel. While management intends to endeavor to locate a viable business opportunity and generate shareholder value, there
can be no assurance that we will succeed in this endeavo 

4 

We
may seek business combination opportunities in industries or sectors that are outside of our management s area of expertise. 

We
will consider a business combination outside of our management s area of expertise if a business combination candidate is presented
to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive opportunity for the Company. Although management intends to endeavor
to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination candidate, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain
or assess all the significant risks, or that we will accurately determine the actual value of a prospective operating entity to acquire.
In the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our management s expertise, our management s ability
to evaluate and make decisions on behalf of the Company may be limited, or we may make material expenditures on additional personnel
or consultants to assist management in the Company s operations. Investors should be aware that the information contained herein
regarding the areas of our management s expertise will not necessarily be relevant to an understanding of the business that we
ultimately elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all the significant risks
or strategic opportunities that may arise. Accordingly, any shareholders in the Company following a business combination could suffer
a reduction in the value of their shares, and any resulting loss will likely not be recoverable. 

We
may attempt to complete a business combination with a private target company about which little information is available, and such target
entity may not generate revenue as expected or otherwise by compatible with us as expected. 

In
pursuing our search for a business to acquire, we will likely seek to complete a business combination with a privately held company.
Very little public information generally exists about private companies, and the only information available to us prior to making a decision
may be from documents and information provided directly to us by the target company in connection with the transaction. Such documents
or information or the conclusions we draw therefrom could prove to be inaccurate or misleading. As such, we may be required to make our
decision on whether to pursue a potential business combination based on limited, incomplete, or faulty information, which may result
in our subsequent operations generating less revenue than expected, which could materially harm our financial condition and results of
operations. 

Our
ability to assess the management of a prospective target business may be limited and, as a result, we may acquire a target business whose
management does not have the skills, qualifications, or abilities to enable a seamless transition, which could, in turn, negatively impact
our results of operations. 

When
evaluating the desirability of a potential business combination, our ability to assess the target business s management may be
limited due to a lack of time, resources, or information. Our management s assessment of the capabilities of the target s
management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities expected. Further,
in most cases the target s management may be expected to want to manage us and replace our Chief Executive Officer. Should the
target s management not possess the skills, qualifications, or abilities necessary to manage a public company or assist with their
former entity s merger or combination into ours, the operations and profitability of the post-acquisition business may be negatively
impacted and our shareholders could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. 

Any
business we acquire will likely lack diversity of operations or geographical reach, and in such case we will be subject to risks associated
with dependence on a single industry or region. 

Our
search for a business will likely be focused on entities with a single or limited business activity and/or that operate in a limited
geographic area. While larger companies have the ability to manage their risk by diversifying their operations among different industries
and regions, smaller companies such as ours and the entities we anticipate reviewing for a potential business combination generally lack
diversification, in terms of both the nature and geographic scope of their business. As a result, we will likely be impacted more acutely
by risks affecting the industry or the region in which we operate than we would if our business were more diversified. In addition to
general economic risks, we could be exposed to natural disasters, civil unrest, technological advances, and other uncontrollable developments
that will threaten our viability if and to the extent our future operations are limited to a single industry or region. If we do not
diversify our operations, our financial condition and results of operations will be at risk. 

Changes
in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to us, may adversely affect our business, ability
to negotiate and complete a business combination, and results of operations. 

We
are subject to laws and regulations enacted by federal, state, and local governments. In addition to SEC regulations, any business we
acquire in the future may be subject to substantial legal or regulatory oversight and restrictions, which could hinder our growth and
expend material amounts on compliance. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming
and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application by courts and administrative judges may also change from
time to time, and any such changes could be unfavorable to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments,
and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could result
in material defense or remedial costs and/or damages have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock 

Due
to factors beyond our control, our stock price may be volatile. 

There
is currently a limited market for our Common Stock, and there can be no guarantee that an active market for our Common Stock will develop,
even if we are successful in consummating a business combination. Recently, the price of our Common Stock has been volatile for no reason.
Further, even if an active market for our Common Stock develops, it will likely be subject to by significant price volatility when compared
to more seasoned issuers. We expect that the price of our Common Stock will continue to be more volatile than more seasoned issuers for
the foreseeable future. Fluctuations in the price of our Common Stock can be based on various factors in addition to those otherwise
described in this Report, including: 

General
 speculative fever; 

A
 prospective business combination and the terms and conditions thereof; 

The
 operating performance of any business we acquire, including any failure to achieve material revenues therefrom; 

The
 performance of our competitors in the marketplace, both pre- and post-combination; 

The
 public s reaction to our press releases, SEC filings, website content and other public announcements and information; 

Changes
 in earnings estimates of any business that we acquire or recommendations by any research analysts who may follow us or other companies
 in the industry of a business that we acquire; 

Variations
 in general economic conditions, including as may be caused by uncontrollable events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting
 decline in the economy; 

The
 public disclosure of the terms of any financing we disclose in the future; 

The
 number of shares of our Common Stock that are publicly traded in the future; 

Actions
 of our existing shareholders, including sales of Common Stock by our then directors and then executive officers or by significant
 investors; and 

The
 employment or termination of key personnel. 

Many
of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of whether we can consummate
a business combination and of our current or subsequent operating performance and financial condition. In the past, following periods
of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities
class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s time and attention, which would otherwise
be used to benefit our business. 

Because
trading in our Common Stock is so limited, investors who purchase our Common Stock may depress the market if they sell Common Stock. 

Our
Common Stock trades on the OTC Pink Market, the successor to the pink sheets. The OTC Pink Market generally is illiquid and most stocks
traded there are of companies that are not required to file reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Our Common Stock itself infrequently
trades. 

The
market price of our Common Stock may decline if a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock are sold at once or in large blocks. 

Presently
the market for our Common Stock is limited. If an active market for our shares develops in the future, some or all of our shareholders
may sell their shares of our Common Stock which may depress the market price. Any sale of a substantial number of these shares in the
public market, or the perception that such a sale could occur, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline, which could
reduce the value of the shares held by our other shareholders. 

Future
issuance of our Common Stock could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders, particularly in connection with an acquisition
and any resulting financing. 

We
may issue additional shares of our Common Stock in the future. The issuance of a substantial amount of our Common Stock could substantially
dilute the interests of our shareholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of Common Stock in the public market, either
in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in a business combination which received our Common Stock as
consideration or by investors who has previously acquired such Common Stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common
Stock. 

6 

Due
to recent changes to Rule 15c2-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our Common Stock may become subject to limitations or reductions
on stock price, liquidity, or volume. 

On
September 16, 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to Rule 15c2-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ).
This Rule applies to broker-dealers who quote securities listed on over-the-counter markets such as our Common Stock. The Rule as amended
prohibits broker-dealers from publishing quotations on OTC markets for an issuer s securities unless they are based on current
publicly available information about the issuer. When it becomes effective, the amended Rule will also limit the Rule s piggyback 
exception, which allows broker-dealers to publish quotations for a security in reliance on the quotations of a broker-dealer that initially
performed the information review required by the Rule, to issuers with current publicly available information or issuers that are up-to-date
in their Exchange Act reports. As of this date, we are uncertain as what actual effect the Rule may have on us. 

The
Rule changes could harm the liquidity and/or market price of our Common Stock by either preventing our shares from being quoted or driving
up our costs of compliance. Because we are a voluntary filer under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and not a public reporting company,
the practical impact of these changes is to require us to maintain a level of periodic disclosure we are not presently required to maintain,
which would cause us to incur material additional expenses. Further, if we cannot or do not provide or maintain current public information
about our company, our stockholders may face difficulties in selling their shares of our Common Stock at desired prices, quantities,
or times, or at all, as a result of the amendments to the Rule.

ITEM
7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS 

The
Company has no operations or revenue as of the date of this Report. We are currently in the process of developing a business plan. Management
intends to explore and identify viable business opportunities within the U.S. including seeking to acquire a business in a reverse merger.
Our ability to effectively identify, develop and implement a viable plan for our business may be hindered by risks and uncertainties
which are beyond our control, including without limitation, the continued negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. and
global economies. For more information about the risk of Covid-19 on our business, see Item 1.A. - Risk Factors . 

Plan
of Operation 

The
Company has no operations from a continuing business other than the expenditures related to running the Company, and has no revenue from
continuing operations as of the date of this Report. 

Management
intends to explore and identify business opportunities within the U.S., including a potential acquisition of an operating entity through
a reverse merger, asset purchase or similar transaction. Our Chief Executive Officer has experience in business consulting, although
no assurances can be given that he can identify and implement a viable business strategy or that any such strategy will result in profits.
Our ability to effectively identify, develop and implement a viable plan for our business may be hindered by risks and uncertainties
which are beyond our control, including without limitation, the continued negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. and
global economies. For more information about the risk of coronavirus on our business, see Item 1A Risk Factors. 

We
do not currently engage in any business activities that provide revenue or cash flow. During the next 12 month period we anticipate incurring
costs in connection with investigating, evaluating, and negotiating potential business combinations, filing SEC reports, and consummating
an acquisition of an operating business. 

Given
our limited capital resources, we may consider a business combination with an entity which has recently commenced operations, is a developing
company or is otherwise in need of additional funds for the development of new products or services or expansion into new markets, or
is an established business experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. Alternatively, a business
combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, an entity which desires access to the U.S. capital markets. 

8 

As
of the date of this Report, our management has not had any discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a potential
business combination. Any target business that is selected may be financially unstable or in the early stages of development. In such
event, we expect to be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or early stage entity.
In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk or in which our
management has limited experience, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business,
there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. 

Our
management anticipates that we will likely only be able to effect one business combination due to our limited capital. This lack of diversification
will likely pose a substantial risk in investing in the Company for the indefinite future because it will not permit us to offset potential
losses from one venture or operating territory against gains from another. The risks we face will likely be heightened to the extent
we acquire a business operating in a single industry or geographical region. 

We
anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be a complex and risk-prone process. Because of general economic conditions,
including unfavorable conditions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages
of available capital, management believes that there are a number of firms seeking business opportunities at this time at discounted
rates with which we will compete. We expect that any potentially available business combinations may appear in a variety of different
industries or regions and at various stages of development, all of which will likely render the task of comparative investigation and
analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complicated. Once we have developed and begun to implement our business
plan, management intends to fund our working capital requirements through a combination of our existing funds and future issuances of
debt or equity securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the implementation of a business plan
and commencement of operations. 

Based
upon our current operations, we do not have sufficient working capital to fund our operations over the next 12 months. If we are able
to close a reverse merger, it is likely we will need capital as a condition of closing that acquisition. Because of the uncertainties,
we cannot be certain as to how much capital we need to raise or the type of securities we will be required to issue. In connection with
a reverse merger, we will be required to issue a controlling block of our securities to the target s shareholders which will be
very dilutive. 

Additional
issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might
have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to our Common Stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms,
or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective
new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

We
anticipate that we will incur operating losses in the next 12 months, principally costs related to our being obligated to file reports
with the SEC. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in
their early stage of development. Such risks for us include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model, recognition
of revenue sources, and the management of growth. To address these risks, we must, among other things, develop, implement, and successfully
execute our business and marketing strategy, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse
effect on our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. 

COVID-19
Update 

To
date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on the Company, particularly due to our current lack of operations. The pandemic
may, however, have an impact on our ability to evaluate and acquire an operating entity through a reverse merger or otherwise. See Item
1A Risk Factors for more information. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As
of the date of this Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or
future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Going
Concern 

The
independent registered public accounting firm auditors report accompanying our August 31, 2021 financial statements contained
an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have
been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and
satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Dengfeng Group Limited as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of operations,
stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
 financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In
addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 

We
determined that there are no critical audit matters.

The Company has not generated any revenue since inception. 

On
March 23, 2015, Artem Rusakov sold shares of the Company s common stock, representing all of the shares of the Company s
common stock owned by Artem Rusakov, to Eastwin Capital Pte Ltd Eastwin ). A change in control of Romulus occurred upon
the transfer of approximately of the ownership of Romulus from Artem Rusakov to Eastwin. 

Also
on March 23, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization pursuant to which its wholly-owned subsidiary,

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified
in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer
or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain
 to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our
 assets; 

provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
 of our management and directors; and 

provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the parameters set forth above and has
concluded that as of August 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as a result of the following material weaknesses: 

The
 Company does not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions due to only having one officer and limited resources. 

The
 Company does not have an independent board of directors or an audit committee. 

The
 Company does not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. 

All
 of the Company s financial reporting is carried out by a financial consultant. 

We
plan to rectify these weaknesses by implementing an independent board of directors, establishing written policies and procedures for
our internal control of financial reporting, and hiring additional accounting personnel at such time as we complete a reverse merger
or similar business acquisition. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

There
have been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year August 31, 2021 that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
