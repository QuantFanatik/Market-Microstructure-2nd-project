DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS 

The
financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as the description of our business contained herein, unless
otherwise indicated, principally reflect the status of our business and the results of our operations as of December 31, 2022. 

Overview 

Historically,
th e Company has been an oil and natural gas exploration,
development and production company, which was primarily in the business of drilling and operating oil and gas wells. From 2009 to 2020,
the Company had pursued the exploration of potential oil and gas resources in the United States and in the Perlas and Tyra concession
blocks in offshore Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea (the Concessions ), which contain a total of approximately 1.4 million
acres. In January 2020, the Company decided to cease its activities, exploration and production in the Concessions. 

Recently,
the Company has changed its focus to include the exploration and development of noble gas and rare earth minerals. Noble gases and rare
earth minerals are generally present in either the natural gas or brine water produced by conventional oil and gas wells. Therefore,
we are now focusing on exploration and development of areas that may contain noble gas and rare earth mineral reserves in addition to
exploration and development of traditional oil and gas. 

The
Company is assessing various opportunities and strategic alternatives involving the acquisition, exploration and development of natural
gas and oil properties in the United States that may include noble gases and rare earth minerals, including the possibility of acquiring
businesses or assets that provide support services for the production of oil, gas, noble gas and rare earth minerals in the United States. 

Central
Kansas Uplift 

On April 1, 2021, we completed
the acquisition of the Central Kansas Uplift Properties, for a purchase price of 900,000. The Central Kansas Uplift Properties include
production and mineral rights/leasehold for oil and gas properties, subject to overriding royalties to third parties, in the Central Kansas
Uplift geological formation covering approximately 11,000 contiguous acres (the Properties ). The purchase of the Properties
included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage.
The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two
conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce oil from the Reagan Sand zone at an approximate depth of 3,600 feet. 

We commenced with certain rework to the existing production
wells after completion of the acquisition of the Properties and have performed testing and evaluation of the existence of noble gas reserves
on the Properties including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals/gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided
encouraging but not conclusive results, and we have yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the
Properties. We plan to assess the Properties existing oil and gas reserves, including the exploration for the existence of
new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves, in particular the noble gases, that the Properties may hold. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the
Company changed its strategy regarding the Central Kansas Uplift considering the reduced net cash flows from the sale of crude oil production.
The reduction in net cash flows was attributable to lower spot crude oil prices during 2022 compared to 2021 and higher than anticipated
operating costs related to the operation of the horizontal wells on the Properties. The Company has shut down the horizontal production
wells as of December 31, 2022 and is considering the deepening of the conventional wells on the property to explore for helium and other
noble gases that may be present in deeper producing zones. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an impairment charge of 712,812 to
reduce the capitalized tangible and intangible costs related to its Central Kansas Uplift properties to zero as of December 31, 2022. 

Hugoton Gas Field Farm-Out 

On
April 4, 2022, the Company acquired a 40 participation in a Farmout Agreement by and between Sunflower Exploration, LLC as the
Farmee and Scout Energy Partners as Farmor Scout with regards to its
oil and gas interests in the Hugoton Gas Field, located in Haskell and Finney Counties, Kansas. The Company has joined three other
parties to explore for and develop potential oil, natural gas, noble gases and brine minerals on the properties underlying the
Farmout Agreement (collectively the Hugoton JV ). 

The
Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells, with the first exploratory well spudded on May 7, 2022. The Hugoton
JV will utilize Scout s existing infrastructure assets including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing. The Farmout
Agreement provides the Hugoton JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, which
will enable the Hugoton JV to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices. 

4 

The
Hugoton JV also acquired the right to all brine minerals subject to a ten percent (10 royalty to Scout, across Finney and Haskell Counties.
Brine minerals are harvested from the formation water produced from active, and to be drilled, oil and gas wells and may include a variety
of dissolved minerals including bromine and iodine. The Hugoton JV plans to target brine minerals with commercial quantities of bromine
and iodine. The Company through the Hugoton JV is currently developing proprietary technology to recover brine minerals, particularly
with respect to bromine, which is well underway and has demonstrated recovery efficiency and is expected to be available for use in existing
and future development wells. 

The
Hugoton JV believes that its unconventional theory has not previously been targeted for exploration by historical operations in the
field. The initial exploratory well was spud on May 7, 2022 near Garden City, Kansas, with production casing set after testing and
completion logs identified at least two potential zones with substantial gas and helium reserves. The initial well was completed
upon the successful perforation across two lower intervals of the Chase group of formations. The fracture stimulation was completed
in two stages during June 2022. The well was connected to the pipeline and commenced commercial production and sale of natural gas,
natural gas liquids and helium on August 17, 2022. The Company is continuing to evaluate the initial flows of both natural gas,
natural gas liquids and helium to determine its plan for additional wells on the farmout. 

The
Company performed the ceiling test to assess potential impairment of the capitalized costs relative to its Hugoton Gas Field Project.
The ceiling test indicated an impairment charge of 192,762 was required to reduce the total capitalized costs to 88,687 as of December
31, 2022. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an impairment charge of 192,762 to reduce the capitalized tangible and intangible costs
related to its Hugoton Gas Field properties to 88,687 as of December 31, 2022. 

Investment
in GMDOC, LLC 

On
May 3, 2022, the Company entered into an operating agreement (the Operating Agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired
17 (or 60.7143 of 28 limited liability membership interests (the Interests in GMDOC, LLC, a Kansas limited liability
company GMDOC ), for an aggregate purchase price of 4,037,500, and was subsequently admitted as a member of GMDOC. 

With
respect to its cash capital contribution, the Company paid a non-refundable cash deposit for the membership interests in the amount of
 50,000 on May 3, 2022. The Company paid the remainder of the cash contribution for the membership interests, or 800,000, on May 16,
2022. The remainder of the Company s capital contribution, or 3,187,500, was financed by the Bank Loan (as defined below). 

GMDOC
had previously acquired 70 of the working interests (the Acquisition in certain oil and gas leases (the GMDOC
Leases from Castelli Energy, L.L.C., an Oklahoma limited liability company Castelli ). The GMDOC Leases cover approximately 10,000
acres located in Southern Kansas near the Oklahoma border. The GMDOC Leases currently produce approximately 100 barrels of oil per
day and 1.5 million cubic feet of natural gas per day on a gross basis. 

GMDOC
is managed by two members: Darrah Oil Company, LLC, and Grand Mesa Operating Company, (collectively the Managing Members ),
which also serve as the operating companies under the GMDOC Leases. 

USNG Letter Agreement 

On November 9, 2021, the
Company entered into a letter agreement (the USNG Letter Agreement with U.S. Noble Gas, LLC USNG ), pursuant
to which USNG provides consulting services to the Company for exploration, testing, refining, production, marketing and distribution of
various potential reserves of noble gases and rare earth element/minerals on the Company s recently acquired 11,000-care oil and
gas properties in the Otis Albert Field located on the Properties. The USNG Letter Agreement would cover all of the noble gases, specifically
helium, and rare earth elements/minerals potentially existing on the Properties and the Company s future acquisitions, if any, including
the Hugoton Gas Field. 

The USNG Letter Agreement
also provided that USNG would supply a large vessel designed for flows up to 5,000 barrels of water per day at low pressures, known as
a gas extraction/separator unit. The gas extraction/separator unit is a dewatering vessel that the Company may use for multiple wells
in the future. 

The USNG Letter Agreement
required the Company to establish a four-member board of advisors (the Board of Advisors comprised of various experts in
noble gas and rare earth elements/minerals. The Board of Advisors will help attract both industry partners and financial partners for
developing a large helium, noble gas and/or rare earth element/mineral resources that may exist in the region where the Company currently
operates. The industry partners would include helium, noble gas and/or rare earth element/mineral purchasers and exploration and development
companies from the energy industry. The financial partners may include large family offices or small institutions. 

Pursuant to the USNG Letter
Agreement, the Company will pay USNG a 8,000 monthly cash fee beginning at the onset of commercial helium or minerals production and
sales, subject to certain thresholds. Such monthly fees will become due and payable for any month that the Company receives cash receipts
in excess of 25,000 derived from the sale of noble gases and/or rare earth elements/minerals. The Company has not yet achieved the 25,000
cash receipts threshold, therefore, there has been no payment or accrual liability relative to this cash fee provision through December
31, 2022. 

The USNG Letter Agreement
has an initial term of 5 years, which shall thereafter continue for successive one-year periods, provided that there is no uncured breach,
unless otherwise terminated by either party upon a written notice of intent to non-renew. 

In consideration for the
consulting services to be rendered and pursuant to the terms of the USNG Letter Agreement, the Company issued warrants to purchase, in
the aggregate, 2,060,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Common Stock ), at an exercise price of
fifty 0.50) to three of USNG s principal consultants and four third-party service providers. The Company also issued warrants
to purchase, in the aggregate, 1,200,000 shares of Common Stock at fifty cents 0.50) per share exercise price to three members of the
Board of Advisors (as defined in the USNG Letter Agreement). The Company granted a total of 3,260,000 warrants to purchase its Common
Stock with an exercise price of fifty cents 0.50) per share in connection with the USNG Letter Agreement and the arrangements described
therein. The warrants expire five years after the date of the USNG Letter Agreement.

compete in virtually all facets of our businesses with numerous other companies in the oil and gas industry, including many that have
significantly greater financial and other resources. Such competitors will be able to pay more for desirable oil and gas leases and to
evaluate, bid for, and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial or personnel resources permit. 

Our
business strategy includes highly competitive oil and natural gas exploration, development and production and the exploration and development
of noble gas and rare earth minerals. We face intense competition from a large number of independent exploration and development companies
as well as major oil and gas companies in a number of areas, such as obtaining the capital necessary to pursue the development of our
recently acquired Kansas Oil and Gas Properties and the Hugoton Gas Field. We may find it difficult to acquire the services, equipment,
labor and materials necessary to explore, operate and develop those properties with the intense competition in our industry. Most of
our competitors have financial and technological resources substantially exceeding those available to us. We cannot be sure that we will
be successful in developing and operating profitably the Properties and the Hugoton Gas Field in the face of this
competition.

Government
Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry 

General 

Our
business is affected by numerous laws and regulations, including, among others, laws and regulations relating to energy, environment,
conservation and tax. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or
criminal penalties, the imposition of injunctive relief or both. Moreover, changes in any of these laws and regulations could have a
material adverse effect on our business. In view of the many uncertainties with respect to current and future laws and regulations, including
their applicability to us, we cannot predict the overall effect of such laws and regulations on our future operations. 

The
following is a summary discussion of the framework of key environmental and land use regulations and requirements affecting oil and natural
gas exploration, development, production and transportation operations and is qualified as mentioned above. 

Environmental
and Land Use Regulation 

Various
federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may affect our operations and costs. The
areas affected include: 

unit
 production expenses primarily related to the control and limitation of air emissions, spill prevention and the disposal of produced
 water; 

capital
 costs to drill development wells resulting from expenses primarily related to the management and disposal of drilling fluids and
 other oil and natural gas exploration wastes; 

capital
 costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities; 

operational
 costs associated with ongoing compliance and monitoring activities; and 

exit
 costs for operations that we are responsible for closing, including costs for dismantling and abandoning wells and remediating environmental
 impacts. 

The
environmental and land use laws and regulations affecting oil and natural gas operations have changed frequently in the past, and in
general, these changes have imposed more stringent requirements that increase operating costs and/or require capital expenditures to
remain in compliance. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in civil and/or criminal fines and liability for non-compliance,
clean-up costs and other environmental damages. It is also possible that unanticipated developments or changes in law could cause us
to make environmental expenditures significantly greater than those we currently expect. 

Operating
Hazards and Insurance 

The
oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks. Historically, we were unable to maintain insurance against such potential
risks and losses. The Company has relevant liability insurance coverage on its Kansas Oil and Gas Properties which is maintained by the
licensed operator of the lease. 

In
addition, pollution and environmental risks are not insured. If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not covered by insurance,
it could adversely affect us. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2022 we had two employees, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, whose compensations have primarily been in the form of
restricted stock grants. Recurring cash salaries for our employees were suspended effective January 1, 2018. During 2021, our Chief Executive
Officer was awarded a cash bonus of 30,000. We also use outside contractors to perform services.

2. Properties. 

This section contains an explanation and detail of
some of the relevant project groupings from our overall inventory of projects and prospects. In 2022 and 2021, we continued to implement
our strategy to acquire and develop oil producing properties in the continental United States. In that regard, we acquired oil and gas
leases the Properties of approximately 11,000 acres located in Central Kansas Uplift and acquired an interest in Hugoton Gas Field. 

Central Kansas Uplift - On April 1,
2021, we completed the acquisition of the Central Kansas Uplift Properties., for a purchase price of 900,000. The Central Kansas Uplift
include the production and mineral rights/leasehold for oil and gas properties, subject to overriding royalties to third parties, in the
Properties, located in Central Kansas Uplift geological formation covering over 11,000 contiguous acres. The purchase of the Properties
included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage.
The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two
conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet. 

We commenced rework to the existing production wells
after completion of the acquisition of the Properties and have performed testing and evaluation of the existence of noble gas reserves
on the Properties including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals/gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided
encouraging but not conclusive results, and we have yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the
Properties. We plan to assess the Properties existing oil and gas reserves, including the exploration for the existence of new oil and
gas zones and other mineral reserves, in particular the noble gas reserves, that the Properties may hold. 

Hugoton Gas Field Farm-Out - On
April 4, 2022, the Company acquired a 40 participation in a Farmout Agreement by and between Sunflower Exploration, LLC as the Farmee
and Scout Energy Partners as Farmor with regards to its oil and gas interests in the Hugoton Gas Field, located in Haskell and Finney
Counties, Kansas. The Company has joined three other parties in the Hugoton JV to explore for and develop potential oil, natural gas,
noble gases and brine minerals on the properties underlying the Farmout Agreement. 

The
Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells, with the first exploratory well spudded on May 7, 2022. The Hugoton
JV will utilize Scout s existing infrastructure assets including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing. The Farmout
Agreement provides the Hugoton JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, which
will enable the Hugoton JV to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices. 

The
Hugoton JV also acquired the right to all brine minerals subject to a ten percent (10 royalty to Scout, across Finney and Haskell Counties.
Brine minerals are harvested from the formation water produced from active, and to be drilled, oil and gas wells and may include a variety
of dissolved minerals including bromine and iodine. The Hugoton JV plans to target brine minerals with commercial quantities of bromine
and iodine. The Company through the Hugoton JV is currently developing proprietary technology to recover brine minerals, particularly
with respect to bromine, which is well underway and has demonstrated recovery efficiency and is expected to be available for use in existing
and future development wells. 

The
Hugoton JV believes that its unconventional theory has not previously been targeted for exploration by historical operations in the field.
The initial exploratory well was spud on May 7, 2022 near Garden City, Kansas, with production casing set after testing and completion
logs identified at least two potential zones with substantial gas and helium reserves. The initial well was completed upon the successful
perforation across two lower intervals of the Chase group of formations. The fracture stimulation was completed in two stages during June
2022. The well was connected to the pipeline and commenced commercial production and sale of natural gas, natural gas liquids and helium
on August 17, 2022. The Company is continuing to evaluate the initial flows of both natural gas, natural gas liquids and helium to determine
its plan for additional wells on the farmout. 

Proved
Reserves Reporting 

The
following tables summarize the net ownership interest in the proved oil and gas reserves and the standardized measure of discounted future
net cash flows related to the proved oil and gas reserves of the Properties. The estimates were prepared by the Company based on the
reserve reports prepared for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The standardized measure presented here excludes
income taxes as the tax basis for the Properties is not applicable due to the substantial net operating loss carryforwards available
to the Company on a go-forward basis. The proved oil and gas reserve estimates and other components of the standardized measure were
determined in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC. 

14 

Proved
Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities 

Proved
reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable
certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating
methods, and government regulations. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing
wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the
cost of a new well. Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage,
or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. The net proved oil and gas reserves and changes
in net proved oil and gas reserves attributable to the Properties with respect to crude oil, and the Hugoton Gas Field
which produces natural gas, natural gas liquids and helium all of which are located in the state of Kansas, are summarized below:

Standard measure of discounted future net cash flows 
 88,687 
 3,640,650 

Requirements for oil and
gas reserve estimation and disclosure require that reserve estimates and future cash flows be based on the average market prices for sales
of oil and gas on the first calendar day of each month during the year. The average prices used for the year ended December 31, 2022 and
2021 under these rules were 94.14 and 66.34 for crude oil, respectively. The average prices used for the year ended December 31, 2022
under these rules were 5.84 per one thousand cubic feet (or MCF for natural gas and 0.76 per gallon for natural gas
liquids and 260.01 per MCF for helium, respectively. 

Future operating expenses and development costs are
computed primarily by the Company s petroleum engineers by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing
the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year, based on year end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions.
As mentioned above, the standardized measure presented here does not include the effects of income taxes as the tax basis for the Properties
due to the substantial tax net operating loss carryforwards available to the Company which makes its use non-applicable on a go-forward
basis. A discount factor of 10 was used to reflect the timing of future net cash flows. The standardized measure of discounted future
net cash flows is not intended to represent the replacement cost or fair value of the Company s Properties. An estimate of fair
value would also take into account, among other things, the recovery of reserves not presently classified as proved, anticipated future
changes in prices and costs, and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in oil and gas
reserve estimates.

Production,
Prices and Production Costs 

We
began production of crude oil in April 2021 following the acquisition of the Properties. 

The
Hugoton Gas Field initial exploratory well was spud on May 7, 2022 near Garden City, Kansas with production casing set after testing
and completion logs identified at least two potential zones with substantial gas and helium reserves. The initial well was completed
upon the successful perforation across two lower intervals of the Chase group of formations. The fracture stimulation was completed in
two stages during June 2022. The well was connected to the pipeline and commenced commercial production and sale of natural gas, natural
gas liquids and helium on August 17, 2022. The Company is continuing to evaluate the initial flows of both natural gas, natural gas liquids
and helium to determine its plan for additional wells on the farmout. 

Significant
Fields 

The
Company principally operates two oil and natural gas production for fields 

1. 
 The
 Properties in the Central Kansas Uplift represents our only producing oil field is which produces primarily crude oil in
 the Otis Albert Field from the Reagan Sand Zone at a depth of 3,600 feet. 

2. 
 The Hugoton Gas Field represe4nts our only producing natural gas, natural
gas liquids and helium. 

Production
and Price History 

The Company produced approximately
1,220 and 1,165 barrels of crude oil during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively from the Properties which had a total
of three producing wells. We received an average price per barrel of crude oil sold of 96.87 and 67.84 per barrel for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The Company produced approximately
12,183 MCFs of natural gas, 26,749 gallons of natural gas liquids and 67 MCFs of helium for the year ended December 31, 2022 from its
initial pilot well that was completed and began commercial production/sale on August 17, 2022 in the Hugoton Gas Field.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company
incurred 288,366 of exploration costs when it drilled its pilot well in the Hugoton Gas Field which was successfully completed and is
producing and selling commercial quantities of natural gas, natural gas liquids and helium. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the
Company incurred 272,799 in development costs on the Kansas Oil Gas Properties in 2021 primarily to assess the potential of noble
gas and rare earth mineral reserves. Such exploration included noble gases such as helium and argon and rare earth minerals included bromine,
lithium and iodine. The Company is assessing the results of such tests to determine whether commercial amounts of reserves exist that
can be profitably extracted on the Properties.

The
 288,366 exploration costs relative the Hugoton Gas Field pilot well during the year ended December 31, 2022 was allocated to
proved oil and gas properties with 191,535 to leasehold costs and 96,831 representing tangible equipment.
The 913,425 acquisition price of the Properties in 2021 was allocated to tangible equipment and seismic data acquired as part of the
acquisition. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company
changed its strategy regarding the Central Kansas Uplift considering the reduced net cash flows from the sale of crude oil production.
The reduction in net cash flows was attributable to lower spot crude oil prices during 2022 compared to 2021 and higher than anticipated
operating costs related to the operation of the horizontal wells on the Properties. The Company has shut down the horizontal production
wells as of December 31, 2022 and is considering the deepening of the conventional wells on the property to explore for helium and other
noble gases that may be present in deeper producing zones. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an impairment charge of 712,812 to
reduce the capitalized tangible and intangible costs related to its Central Kansas Uplift properties to zero as of December 31, 2022. 

The Company performed the ceiling test to assess
potential impairment of the capitalized costs relative to its Hugoton Gas Field Project. The ceiling test indicated an impairment charge
of 192,762 was required to reduce the total capitalized costs to 88,687 as of December 31, 2022. Accordingly, the Company has recorded
an impairment charge of 192,762 to reduce the capitalized tangible and intangible costs related to its Hugoton Gas Field properties
to 88,687 as of December 31, 2022.

3. Legal Proceedings. 

The
Company is subject to numerous claims and legal actions in which vendors are claiming breach of contract due to the Company s failure
to pay amounts due. The Company believes that it has made adequate provision for these claims in the accompanying financial statements. 

The
Company is currently involved in litigation as follows: 

In
 October 2012, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit naming Infinity Oil and Gas of Texas, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
 Company which was sold in 2012 Infinity-Texas ), the Company and the corporate officers of Infinity-Texas, seeking
 30,000 of reclamation costs associated with a single well, in addition to administrative expenses and penalties. The Company
 engaged in negotiations with the State of Texas in late 2012 and early 2013 and reached a settlement agreement that would reduce the
 aggregate liability, in this action and any extension of this action to other Texas wells, to 45,103, which amount has been paid.
 Certain performance obligations remain which must be satisfied in order to finally settle and dismiss the matter. 

Pending satisfactory performance of the performance obligations and their acceptance
by the State of Texas, the Company s officers have potential liability regarding the above matter, and the Company officers are
held personally harmless by indemnification provisions of the Company. Therefore, to the extent they might actually occur, these liabilities
are the obligations of the Company. Management estimates that the liabilities associated with this matter will not exceed 780,000, calculated
as 30,000 for each of the 26 Infinity-Texas operated wells. This related liability, less the payment made to the State of Texas in 2012
in the amount of 45,103, is included in the asset retirement obligation on the accompanying balance sheets, which management believes
is sufficient to provide for ultimate resolution of this dispute. 

On
 September 26, 2014, Cambrian Consultants America, Inc. Cambrian filed an action in the District Court of Harris County,
 Texas, against the Company resulting from certain professional consulting services provided for quality control and management of
 seismic operations during November and December 2013 on the Concessions. Cambrian provided these services pursuant to a master consulting
 agreement with AMGAS, dated November 20, 2013, and has claimed breach of contract for failure to pay amounts due. On December 8,
 2014, a default judgment was entered against the Company in the amount of 96,877 plus interest and attorney fees. The Company has
 included the impact of this litigation as a liability in its accounts payable which management believes is sufficient to provide for ultimate resolution
of this dispute. 

18 

Torrey
 Hills Capital, Inc. Torrey notified the Company by a letter, dated August 15, 2014, of its demand for the payment
 of 56,000, which it alleged was unpaid and owed under a consulting agreement dated October 18, 2013. Torrey and the Company entered
 into a consulting agreement, pursuant to which Torrey agreed to provide investor relations services in exchange for payment of 7,000
 per month and the issuance of 15,000 shares of Common Stock. The agreement was for an initial three month-term with automatic renewals
 unless terminated upon 30 days written notice by either party. The Company made payments totaling 14,000 and issued 15,000
 shares of Common Stock during 2013. The Company contended that Torrey breached the agreement by not performing the required services
 and that it had provided proper notice of termination to Torrey. Furthermore, the Company contended that the parties agreed to settle
 the dispute on or about June 19, 2014 under which it would issue 2,800 shares of Common Stock in full settlement of any balance then
 owed and final termination of the agreement. Torrey disputed the Company s contentions and submitted the dispute to binding
 arbitration. The Company was unable to defend itself and the arbitration panel awarded Torrey a total of 79,594 in damages. The
 Company has accrued this amount in accounts payable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, which management believes is sufficient to
 provide for the ultimate resolution of this dispute.

Kansas Uplift - On April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Central Kansas Uplift Properties, for a purchase price
of 900,000. The Central Kansas Uplift Properties include the production and mineral rights/leasehold for oil and gas properties, subject
to overriding royalties to third parties, in the Central Kansas Uplift geological formation covering over 11,000 contiguous acres (the
 Properties ). The purchase of the Properties included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of
11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater
injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the
Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet. 

We commenced rework of the existing production wells
after completion of the acquisition of the Properties and have performed testing and evaluation of the existence of noble gas reserves
on the Properties including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals/gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided
encouraging but not conclusive results and we have yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties.
The Company plans to assess the Properties existing oil and gas reserves, including the exploration for the existence of new oil
and gas zones and other mineral reserves, in particular, the noble gas reserves that the Properties may hold. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the
Company changed its strategy regarding the Central Kansas Uplift considering the reduced net cash flows from the sale of crude oil production.
The reduction in net cash flows was attributable to lower spot crude oil prices during 2022 compared to 2021 and higher than anticipated
operating costs related to the operation of the horizontal wells on the Properties. The Company has shut down the horizontal production
wells as of December 31, 2022 and is considering the deepening of the conventional wells on the property to explore for helium and other
noble gases that may be present in deeper producing zones. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an impairment charge of 712,812 to
reduce the capitalized tangible and intangible costs related to its Central Kansas Uplift properties to zero as of December 31, 2022. 

Hugoton
Gas Field Farm-Out - On April 4, 2022, the Company acquired a 40 participation in a Farmout Agreement by and between Sunflower
Exploration, LLC as the Farmee and Scout Energy Partners as Farmor with regards to its oil and gas interests in the Hugoton Gas Field,
located in Haskell and Finney Counties, Kansas. The Company has joined three other parties to explore for and develop potential oil,
natural gas, noble gases and brine minerals on the properties underlying the Farmout Agreement (collectively the Hugoton JV ). 

The
Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells, with the first exploratory well spudded on May 7, 2022. The Hugoton
JV will utilize Scout s existing infrastructure assets including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing. The Farmout
Agreement provides the Hugoton JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, which
will enable the Hugoton JV to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices. 

26 

The
Hugoton JV also acquired the right to all brine minerals subject to a ten percent (10 royalty to Scout, across Finney and Haskell Counties.
Brine minerals are harvested from the formation water produced from active, and to be drilled, oil and gas wells and may include a variety
of dissolved minerals including bromine and iodine. The Hugoton JV plans to target brine minerals with commercial quantities of bromine
and iodine. The Company through the Hugoton JV is currently developing proprietary technology to recover brine minerals, particularly
with respect to bromine, which is well underway and has demonstrated recovery efficiency and is expected to be available for use in existing
and future development wells. 

The
Hugoton JV believes that its unconventional theory has not previously been targeted for exploration by historical operations in the
field. The initial exploratory well was spud on May 7, 2022 near Garden City, Kansas, with production casing set after testing and
completion logs identified at least two potential zones with substantial gas and helium reserves. The initial well was completed
upon the successful perforation across two lower intervals of the Chase group of formations. The fracture stimulation was completed
in two stages during June 2022. The well was connected to the pipeline and commenced commercial production and sales of natural gas,
natural gas liquids and helium on August 17, 2022. The Company is continuing to evaluate the initial flows of both natural gas,
natural gas liquids and helium to determine its plan for additional wells on the farmout. 

The
Company performed the ceiling test to assess potential impairment of the capitalized costs relative to its Hugoton Gas Field Project.
The ceiling test indicated an impairment charge of 192,762 was required to reduce the total capitalized costs to 88,687 as of December
31, 2022. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an impairment charge of 192,762 to reduce the capitalized tangible and intangible costs
related to its Hugoton Gas Field properties to 88,687 as of December 31, 2022.

Operational and Financial Objectives 

COVID 19
PANDEMIC 

The
financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as the description of our business contained herein, unless
otherwise indicated, principally reflect the status of our business and the results of our operations as of and for the year ended December
31, 2022. Economies throughout the world have been and continue to suffer disruptions by the effects of the quarantines, business closures
and the reluctance of individuals to leave their homes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the oil and gas market has
been severely adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic because of the substantial and abrupt decrease in the demand
for oil and gas globally followed by the recent resurgence in oil and natural gas prices. In addition, the capital markets have experienced
periods of disruption and our efforts to raise necessary capital in the future may be adversely impacted by the continuing effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic and investor sentiment and we cannot forecast with any certainty when the lingering uncertainty caused by the COVID-19
pandemic will cease to impact our business and the results of our operations. In reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our
discussion of our ability to continue as a going concern set forth herein, in each case, consider the additional uncertainties caused
by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Company s 2023 operating objectives are focused on: 1) raising the necessary funds to finance exploration and development of the

September 15, 2022), which the Company did not pay by their maturity dates . The Company and the holder of the two convertible
notes payable entered into the New Note, exchanging the outstanding principal amount of the old convertible notes payable into the
New Note, with a maturity date of September 30, 2023. Upon issuance of the New Note, the old convertible notes payable were
cancelled and the repayment defaults under the prior convertible notes payable were cured with the entry into the New Note. The
conversion price of the New Note was reduced from 0.50 per share to 0.40 per share however, the interest rate and other
significant terms of the New Note are the same as those of the prior convertible notes payable.

2021. The extinguishment of the debt obligations resulted in a gain of 55,230, which was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2021. 

USNG
Letter Agreement 

On
November 9, 2021, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the USNG Letter Agreement with U.S. Noble Gas, LLC USNG ),
pursuant to which USNG provides consulting services to the Company for exploration, testing, refining, production, marketing and distribution
of various potential reserves of noble gases and rare earth element/minerals on the Company s recently acquired 11,000-care oil
and gas properties in the Otis Albert Field located on the Properties. The USNG Letter Agreement would cover all of the noble gases,
specifically helium, and rare earth elements/minerals potentially existing on the Properties and the Company s future acquisitions,
if any, including the Hugoton Gas Field. 

The
USNG Letter Agreement also provided that USNG would supply a large vessel designed for flows up to 5,000 barrels of water per day at
low pressures, known as a gas extraction/separator unit. The gas extraction/separator unit is a dewatering vessel that the Company may
use for multiple wells in the future. 

The
USNG Letter Agreement required the Company to establish a four-member board of advisors (the Board of Advisors comprised
of various experts in noble gas and rare earth elements/minerals. The Board of Advisors will help attract both industry partners and
financial partners for developing a large helium, noble gas and/or rare earth element/mineral resources that may exist in the region
where the Company currently operates. The industry partners would include helium, noble gas and/or rare earth element/mineral purchasers
and exploration and development companies from the energy industry. The financial partners may include large family offices or small
institutions. 

34 

Pursuant
to the USNG Letter Agreement, the Company will pay USNG a 8,000 monthly cash fee beginning at the onset of commercial helium or minerals
production and sales, subject to certain thresholds. Such monthly fees will become due and payable for any month that the Company receives
cash receipts in excess of 25,000 derived from the sale of noble gases and/or rare earth elements/minerals. The Company has not yet
achieved the 25,000 cash receipts threshold, therefore, there has been no payment or accrual liability relative to this cash fee provision
through December 31, 2022. 

The
USNG Letter Agreement has an initial term of 5 years, which shall thereafter continue for successive one-year periods, provided that
there is no uncured breach, unless otherwise terminated by either party upon a written notice of intent to non-renew. 

In
consideration for the consulting services to be rendered and pursuant to the terms of the USNG Letter Agreement, the Company issued warrants
to purchase, in the aggregate, 2,060,000 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of fifty 0.50) to three of USNG s principal
consultants and four third-party service providers. The Company also issued warrants to purchase, in the aggregate, 1,200,000 shares
of Common Stock at fifty cents 0.50) per share exercise price to three members of the Board of Advisors. The Company granted a total
of 3,260,000 warrants to purchase its Common Stock with an exercise price of fifty cents 0.50) per share in connection with the USNG
Letter Agreement and the arrangements described therein. The warrants expire five years after the date of the USNG Letter Agreement. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet debt, nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations)
or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have a material current or future effect on our financial
conditions, changes in our financial conditions, or our results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or
significant components of revenue or expenses except as follows: 

Investment
in Unconsolidated Subsidiary GMDOC - On May 3, 2022, the Company entered into the Operating Agreement pursuant to which
the Company acquired 17 (or 60.7143 of 28 limited liability membership Interests in GMDOC, for an aggregate purchase price of 4,037,500,
and was subsequently admitted as a member of GMDOC. 

With
respect to its cash capital contribution, the Company paid a non-refundable cash deposit for the membership interests in the amount of
 50,000 on May 3, 2022. The Company paid the remainder of the cash contribution for the membership interests, or 800,000, on May 16,
2022. The remainder of the Company s capital contribution, or 3,187,500, was financed by the Bank Loan (as defined below). 

GMDOC
had previously acquired 70 of the working interests in the GMDOC Leases from Castelli Energy, L.L.C, an Oklahoma limited liability company.
The GMDOC Leases cover approximately 10,000 acres located in Southern Kansas near the Oklahoma border. The GMDOC Leases currently produce
approximately 100 barrels of oil per day and 1.5 million cubic feet of natural gas per day on a gross basis. 

Pursuant
to the terms of the Operating Agreement, each member agreed to pay GMDOC, as its capital contribution, 50,000 in cash per Interest,
with the remainder to be financed, in part, by a loan to GMDOC from a commercial bank, secured by GMDOC s property, in the aggregate
amount of 6,045,000 (the Bank Loan ). The principal of the Bank Loan is to be repaid in 84 varying monthly installments,
ranging from 170,000 at the beginning to 40,500 at the end of the loan term, with the first installment on July 1, 2022. The Bank Loan
bears a variable interest beginning at an initial rate of 6 per annum with one rate adjustment after 36 months subject to a 6 minimum
interest rate.

For
the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 

Results
of Operations 

Revenue 

The
Company began generating revenues from the production and sale of crude oil since the acquisition of the Properties on April 1,
2021. Revenues totaled 117,125 and 79,002 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 38,123 or 48 
increase in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 reflects the commencement of
natural gas and helium sales from the initial Hugoton Gas Field which was connected to the pipeline on August 17, 2022 as well as
the timing of the purchase of the Properties. The Company expects its revenues to continue to improve as the price of WTI crude oil
remains strong and the Company increases the volume of natural gas and helium gas sold as it continues its drill and complete wells
pursuant to its Hugoton Gas Field participation agreement. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, our revenue was substantially impacted by inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine,
which has restricted the world supply of oil and gas and thereby increased the average WTI crude oil price. We expect this trend to continue
during 2023 and perhaps beyond. 

Oil
and Gas Lease Operating Expenses 

The
Company began generating revenues from the production and sale of crude oil since the acquisition of the Properties on April 1,
2021. Total oil and gas lease operating expenses totaled 279,067 and 530,118 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The decrease in oil and gas lease operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same
period in 2021 is attributable to significant repairs and rework performed in the year ended December 31, 2022 that did not recur
during the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Upon
completion of our acquisition of the Properties on April 1, 2021, we commenced rework of the existing production wells on the Properties
in order to restore the three producing wells to full operational condition. All such rework costs were expensed as routine maintenance
instead of capitalized to oil and gas properties and equipment under the full-cost method. In addition, we have performed certain exploration,
including testing and evaluation for the existence of noble gas reserves on the Properties, including helium, argon and other rare earth
minerals/gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided encouraging but not conclusive results and the Company
has yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties. The Company plans to assess the existing
oil and gas reserves on the Properties while continuing the evaluation of the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves
and specifically the noble gas reserves that the Properties may hold. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, our oil and gas lease operating expenses have been substantially impacted by inflation, the COVID-19
pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine, which has restricted the supply of production pipe and other materials used in the drilling
and rework of oil and gas wells. In addition, experienced oil and gas service professionals have been in high demand in the oil and gas
service sector and thereby increasing the cost of oil and gas well services. We expect this trend to continue during the 2023 and perhaps
beyond. 

Depreciation,
Depletion and Impairment 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense totaled
 1,035,827 and 92,502 during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Depreciation and depletion expenses were 130,253 and 92,502 for the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Impairment charges totaled 905,574 and for the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively. 

The Company began generating revenues from the production
and sale of natural gas and helium from the Hugoton Gas Field on August 17, 2022 and crude oil since the acquisition of the Properties
on April 1, 2021, which was acquired for 900,000 cash plus the assumption of asset retirement obligations of 13,425. The Company allocated
the purchase price of 913,425 to oil and gas properties and equipment, which is subject to depreciation, depletion and amortization as
the acquisition qualified as an asset acquisition. The Company began generating revenues from the production and sale of natural gas and
helium from the Hugoton Gas Field on August 17, 2022, which also marked the beginning of the related depreciation, depletion and amortization. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company
changed its strategy regarding the Central Kansas Uplift considering the reduced net cash flows from the sale of crude oil production.
The reduction in net cash flows was attributable to lower spot crude oil prices during 2022 compared to 2021 and higher than anticipated
operating costs related to the operation of the horizontal wells on the Properties. The Company has shut down the horizontal production
wells as of December 31, 2022 and is considering the deepening of the conventional wells on the property to explore for helium and other
noble gases that may be present in deeper producing zones. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an impairment charge of 712,812 to
reduce the capitalized tangible and intangible costs related to its Central Kansas Uplift properties to zero as of December 31, 2022. 

The Company performed the ceiling test to assess
potential impairment of the capitalized costs relative to its Hugoton Gas Field Project. The ceiling test indicated an impairment charge
of 192,762 was required to reduce the total capitalized costs to 88,687 as of December 31, 2022. Accordingly, the Company has recorded
an impairment charge of 192,762 to reduce the capitalized tangible and intangible costs related to its Hugoton Gas Field properties
to 88,687 as of December 31, 2022. 

Accretion
of Asset Retirement Obligation 

Total
expense for the accretion of asset retirement obligations was 2,222 and 836 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The Company determined the amount of the asset retirement obligation assumed to be 13,425 as of April 1, 2021, the date of the acquisition
of the Properties. In addition, the Company commenced production from the Hugoton Gas Field well which began the accretion of
its related asset retirement obligations. The obligation relates to legal requirements associated with the retirement of long-lived assets
that result from the acquisitions, construction, development, or normal use of the asset. The obligation relates primarily to the requirement
to plug and abandon oil and natural gas wells and support wells at the conclusion of their useful lives. 

36 

Oil
and Gas Production Related Taxes 

Oil and gas production related taxes totaled 164
and 1,060 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Such taxes are deducted from gross oil and gas revenue by the
crude oil purchaser upon payment to the Company and include primarily severance taxes imposed by the State of Kansas, and Kansas conservation
assessment fees. Revenues totaled 117,125 for the year ended December 31, 2022, which resulted in the deduction of 164 in production
related taxes. Revenues totaled 79,002 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in the deduction of 1,060 in production
related taxes primarily due to severance taxes paid in 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received a notice from
the State of Kansas that exempted the Company from paying severance taxes due to the existing wells production levels. Therefore,
production related taxes declined as a percentage of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in
2021. 

Other
General and Administrative Expenses 

Other
general and administrative expenses were 1,500,504 for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 463,508, or 45 , from other
general and administrative expenses of 1,036,996 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in other general and administrative
expenses is primarily attributable to an increase of 549,561 in stock-based compensation due to the noncash compensation awarded to
the Company s executives, members of the Board of Directors, the USNG Letter Agreement, which awarded compensatory warrants to advisory
members of the Board of Advisors and other consultants in 2022 and in late 2021. The increase in stock-based compensation was offset
by a 75,000 charge-off of one option to acquire a property during the year ended December 31, 2021 that did not recur in the comparable
period in 2022. 

Equity
in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiary GMDOC 

The
Company reported equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiary of 251,461 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to -0- for
the year ended December 31, 2021. Such income resulted from the Company acquiring a 60.7143 membership interest in GMDOC in May 2022.
The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant
influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee, GMDOC. Management s judgment regarding its level
of influence over the operations of GMDOC included considering key factors such as the Company s ownership interest, legal form
of the investee, its lack of participation in policy-making decisions and its lack of control over the day-to-day operations
of GMDOC. 

GMDOC
had previously acquired 70 of the working interests in the GMDOC Leases from Castelli Energy, L.L.C., an Oklahoma limited liability
company. The GMDOC Leases cover approximately 10,000 acres located in Southern Kansas near the Oklahoma border. The GMDOC leases currently
produce approximately 100 barrels of oil per day and 1.5 million cubic feet of natural gas per day on a gross basis. GMDOC, LLC generated
 414,171 of net income on 2,397,406 of oil and gas revenues during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company owns a 60.7143 membership
interest in such net income or 251,461 which it has reported as equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiary GMDOC during
the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense increased to 913,608 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 108,052 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The
increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2022 was attributable to 218,680 of default interest accrued on the
convertible notes that were in default at December 31, 2022. Management believes that it will be able to negotiate the waiver of
such default interest when it negotiates amendments to the notes in default during 2023. In addition the increase was attributable
to the issuance of the various convertible notes payable issued in 2022 and in 2021 that were outstanding during the year ended
December 31, 2022 and not outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Gain
on Extinguishment of Liabilities 

The
Company reported a gain on exchange and extinguishment of liabilities of -0- and 86,602 in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. 

On
April 1, 2021, the Company and the holders of two notes payable aggregating 85,000 that were in default reached a settlement whereby
the Company issued a total of 245,000 shares of Common Stock in exchange for the extinguishment of the outstanding principal, accrued
interest and associated Common Stock purchase warrants, which totaled 123,830, as of April 1, 2021. The 245,000 shares issued to extinguish
the debt obligations resulted in a gain of 55,230 which was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2021. 

On
March 31, 2021, the Company recorded a net gain on extinguishment of liabilities totaling 31,372, which was attributable to six transactions
that extinguished outstanding liabilities as of that date. The Debt Settlement Agreements extinguished accounts payable and accrued liabilities
with a total outstanding balance of 2,866,497, for the issuance of 28,665 in principal balance of the 3 Notes. Such 3 Notes were
issued with the 3 Warrants, which were valued at 1,605,178. The transaction resulted in a total gain of 1,232,654 of which 124,177
was reported as a gain on extinguishment of liabilities and 1,108,477 was reported as a capital contribution during the year ended December
31, 2021. The 23,000 gain from settlement of litigation extinguished 33,000 of trade payables for a cash payment of 10,000. The loss
of 115,805 is related to the early retirement of 365,169 principal balance of the August 2020 Note. There were no similar transactions
during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Change
in Warrant Derivative Fair Value 

The
change in warrant derivative liability was an expense of 577,269 during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to a gain of
 199 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The estimated fair value of the Company s derivative liabilities, all of which
were related to the detachable warrants issued in connection with the issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, were
estimated using a closed-ended option pricing model utilizing assumptions related to the contractual term of the instruments,
estimated volatility of the price of the Company s common stock and current interest rates. The detachable warrants issued in
connection with the issuance of certain Series A Convertible Preferred Stock contained a provision allowing the holder to require cash settlement in certain situations were fundamental
transaction, as defined in the warrant agreements have occurred. An event occurred on December 31, 2022 that activated the
Holder s ability to utilize such provisions, therefore the derivative liability was recognized on December 31, 2022. 

The
conversion feature in certain outstanding notes payable and Common Stock purchase warrants issued in connection with short-term notes
outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2021 were treated as derivative instruments because such notes payable and warrants contained
ratchet and anti-dilution provisions. The mark-to-market process resulted in a gain of 199 during the year ended December 31, 2021.
There were no similar derivatives outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2022. All short-term notes and their related derivative
warrants were terminated on April 1, 2021. 

Income
Tax 

The
Company recorded no income tax benefit (expense) in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company has been in a cumulative
tax loss position and has substantial net operating loss carryforwards available for its utilization at December 31, 2022. The Company
has continued to carry a 100 reserve on its net deferred tax assets and therefore recorded no income tax expense or benefit on its income
(loss) before income taxes during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Net
Loss 

The
Company reported a net loss of 3,940,075 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a net loss of 1,603,761 for the year
ended December 31, 2021. This represents an increase in net loss of 2,336,314 for the year December 31, 2022 compared to the year
ended December 31, 2021. 

38 

Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock Dividends 

The
Company recorded 231,619 and 174,449 in convertible preferred stock dividends in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
On March 26, 2021, the Company issued and classified its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock as equity securities on its balance sheet.
During 2022, the Company issued additional shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, therefore, there were more shares of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. All shares
of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock bear a cumulative dividend at a 10 rate based on its stated/liquidation value. 

Net
Loss Applicable to Common Stockholders 

The
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued in 2022 and 2021 have dividend and/or distribution preferences over our Common Stock
and, therefore, such accrued dividend amounts have been deducted from net loss to report net loss applicable to common stockholders
of 4,171,694 and 1,778,210 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Basic
and Diluted Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders per Share 

Basic
net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the
weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders
per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common
Stock and dilutive Common Stock Equivalents outstanding during the period. Common Stock Equivalents included in the diluted net loss
attributable to common stockholders per share computation represent shares of Common Stock issuable upon the assumed conversion of convertible
notes payable, Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock and
 if converted method. For periods in which net losses attributable to common stockholders are incurred, weighted average
shares outstanding is the same for basic and diluted loss per share calculations, as the inclusion of Common Stock Equivalents would
have an anti-dilutive effect. 

The
Company incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, therefore all Common
Stock Equivalents were considered anti-dilutive and excluded from diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per share computations.
The basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per share were (0.20) and (0.09) for the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Potential
Common Stock Equivalents as of December 31, 2022 totaled 32,688,238 shares of Common Stock, which included 2,838,580 shares of Common
Stock underlying the convertible notes payable, 7,976,875 shares of Common Stock underlying the conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock, 20,430,783 shares of Common Stock underlying outstanding warrants and 1,442,000 shares of Common Stock underlying outstanding
stock options. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources; Going Concern 

We have had a history of losses and have generated
little or no operating revenues for a number of years. In 2020, we began assessing various opportunities and strategic alternatives involving
the acquisition, exploration and development of gas and oil properties in the United States, including the possibility of acquiring businesses
or assets that provide support services for the production of oil and gas in the United States. As a result, we: 1) acquired the Properties,
2) entered into the Hugoton JV and 3) entered into the GMDOC venture. 

The
planned development of the development projects previously identified will require us to raise additional capital to accomplish our operating
plan, which cannot be assured. Historically, we financed our operations through the issuance of equity and various short and long-term
debt financing that contained some level of detachable warrants to provide the holders with a level of equity participation. 

39 

Capital
Raised 

Historically,
we have raised funds through various equity and debt instruments through private transactions. The following summarizes the sources of
significant liquidity raised during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: 

Year ended December 31, 2022 
 
 Capital raised: 

Issuance of convertible notes payable together with the issuance of 425,000 shares of Common Stock 
 850,000 
 
 Issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with detachable Common Stock purchase warrants 
 645,000 
 
 Issuance of convertible notes payable with detachable Common Stock purchase warrants 
 350,000 

Total capital raised 
 1,845,000 

Year ended 
 December 31, 2021 
 
 Capital raised: 

Issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with detachable Common Stock purchase warrants 
 1,929,089 
 
 Issuance of convertible notes payable with detachable Common Stock purchase warrants 
 650,000 

Total capital raised 
 2,579,089 

The
Company was able to raise liquidity during 2022 and 2021 through the issuance of debt and equity in private transactions with accredited
investors. These financial instruments generally require the Company to register the Common Stock underlying the conversion of the Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock, the Common Stock purchase warrants and the convertible notes payable. These issuances generally provide
the holders with a right to participate in future capital raises and require their approval for the future issuance of securities at
rates less than their purchase price. The holders have also agreed that the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the
convertible notes payable and the exercise of the underlying warrants are generally subject to beneficial ownership limitations such
that each holder of the financial instruments individually may not convert the underlying Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, convertible
notes payable or exercise the underlying warrants to the extent that such conversion or exercise would result in any of the holders individually
being the beneficial owner in excess of 4.99 (or, upon election of the holders, 9.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding
immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion or exercise, which beneficial
ownership limitation may be increased or decreased up to 9.99 upon notice to the Company, provided that any increase in such limitation
will not be effective until 61 days following notice to the Company. 

We
will likely continue to issue such convertible notes payable with detachable warrants to acquire Common Stock to fund our operational
and capital expenditure plans for 2023. 

Capital
Expenditures 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had: 1) acquired the Properties, 2) entered into the Hugoton JV and 3) entered into the GMDOC venture as more
fully described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

40 

Going
Concern 

The
Company has incurred losses from operations, has a stockholders deficit, incurred net cash used in operating activities and
has a significant working capital deficit as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company must raise substantial
amounts of debt and equity capital from other sources in the future in order to fund (i) the development of the Properties acquired on
April 1, 2021; (ii) our obligations for exploration and development under the Hugoton Farmout Agreement; (iii) normal day-to-day operations
and corporate overhead; and (iv) outstanding debt and other financial obligations as they become due. Some of the Company s outstanding
debt and other financial obligations are currently past due and the Company anticipates that other debt and financial obligations will
become past due imminently. These are substantial operational and financial issues that must be successfully addressed during 2023 and
beyond. 

The
Company has made substantial progress in resolving many of its existing financial obligations during the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021. 

The
Company will have significant financial commitments to execute its planned exploration and development of the Properties and the Hugoton
Gas Field. The Company may find it necessary to raise substantial amounts of debt or equity capital to fund such exploration and development
activities and may seek offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the Properties in exchange for cash and
a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement. There can be no assurance that it will
be able to obtain such new funding or be able to reach agreements with industry operators and other third parties or on what terms. 

Due
to the uncertainties related to the foregoing matters, there exists substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern within one year after the date the financials are issued. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities
that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Cash
and cash equivalents balances- 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents with an aggregate balance of 10,163, a decrease from a balance of 260,590 as
of December 31, 2021. Summarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent subsections are the main elements of
the 250,427 net decrease in cash during the year ended December 31, 2022: 

Operating
 activities : 
 249,841
 of net cash used in operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was 249,841 and 801,553 for the years
 ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an improvement in net cash used in operating activities of 551,712. The improvement
 in net cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of an increase in non-cash expenses including the change in warrant
 derivative liability, discount amortization on debt and stock-based compensation, the impairment charge to oil and gas properties, an increase in accounts payable and accrued
 interest reflected in our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in
 2021. 

Investing
 activities : 
 1,153,591
 of net cash used in investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was 1,153,591 for the year ended December
 31, 2022 compared to 900,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. We utilized funds during 2022 to acquire our membership interest
 in GMDOC and to drill the initial exploratory well pursuant to the Hugoton Gas Field participation agreement. We utilized funds during
 2021 to acquire the Properties. 

Financing
 activities: 
 1,153,005
 of net cash provided by financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022
 was 1,153,005 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 1,951,101 for the year ended December 31, 2021. We raised a
 total of 1,200,000 from the issuance of convertible notes payable and 645,000 from the issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred
 Stock with detachable warrants during the year ended December 31, 2022. These financing cash inflows were offset by the repayment
 of 537,500 principal balance of convertible notes payable and the payment of dividends totaling 154,495 on the Series A Convertible
 Preferred Stock during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company raised 1,929,089 through the issuance of Series A Convertible
 Preferred Stock and 650,000 in convertible notes payable, which was offset by the repayment of 453,539 principal balance of convertible
 debt and the payment of dividends totaling 174,449 on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock during the year ended December 31,
 2021. 

41 

The
net result of these activities was a 250,427 decrease in cash and cash equivalents from 260,590 as of December 31, 2021 to 10,163
as of December 31, 2022. 

Commitments: 

Capital
Expenditures . We had no material commitments for capital expenditures at December 31, 2022. However, we are required by the Hugoton
Gas Field Farmout Agreement to drill at least three additional gas production wells in 2023 and 2024 in order to maintain the Hugoton JV. We drilled and completed the first Hugoton Gas Field production well in May 2022, which was connected to the pipeline and
commenced production on August 17, 2022. We estimate that the expenses related to the drilling program to be approximately 300,000 for
drilling and completion of each additional exploratory well. 

Repayment
of Debt . Debt obligations are comprised of the following at December 31, 2022: 

December 31, 2022 
 
 Convertible notes payable: 

8 convertible notes payable due October 29, 2022 (in default)

With respect
to two of the 8 convertible notes payable due October 29, 2022 with an outstanding aggregate
principal balance of 500,000 as of December 31, 2022, the Company has reached an agreement with the two Investors. On January 10, 2023,
the Company amended each of those notes by entering into a letter agreement between the Investors and the Company. The Letter
Agreement modifies the terms of the notes by extending each note s respective maturity date to September 30, 2023. In consideration
for the extension, the Company amended the Fixed Conversion Price (as defined in each note) to 0.10, subject to any future adjustments
as provided in each of the notes. 

On
May 5, 2023, the Company reached an agreement with the holder of two separate convertible notes payable in the aggregate principal face
amount of approximately 450,000 (including 100,000 principal balance of the notes payable due October 29, 2022 and 350,000 principal
balance of the note payable due September 15, 2022), which the Company did not pay by their maturity dates . The Company and the
holder of the two convertible notes payable entered into a new convertible promissory note (the New Note ), exchanging the
outstanding principal amount of the old convertible notes payable into the New Note, with a maturity date of September 30, 2023. Upon
issuance of the New Note, the old convertible notes payable were cancelled and the repayment defaults under the prior convertible notes
payable were cured with the entry into the New Note. The conversion price of the New Note was reduced from 0.50 per share to
 0.40 per share however, the interest rate and other significant terms of the New Note are the same as those of the prior
convertible notes payable. 

With respect
to the 8 convertible notes payable due June 29, 2022 with an outstanding aggregate principal
balance of 312,500 as of December 31, 2022, the Company has reached an agreement with the two Investors. On January 10, 2023, the Company
amended each of those notes by entering into a letter agreement between the Investors and the Company. The Letter Agreement modifies
the terms of the notes by extending each note s respective maturity date to September 30, 2023. In consideration for the extension,
the Company amended the Fixed Conversion Price (as defined in each note) to 0.10, subject to any future adjustments as provided in each
of the notes. 

With respect to the other
notes that were not amended or exchanged on January 10, 2023 and May 5, 2023, the parties are negotiating a forbearance/resolution to
such technical defaults which include several alternatives. Such negotiations include i) a reduction in the conversion price of the underlying
convertible notes, ii) an extension and a roll-over of the principal into other Company securities, and iii) a combination of the alternatives.
The Company can provide no assurance that the parties will reach a mutually agreeable resolution. 

Open
Litigation. 

The nature of
the Company s business exposes its properties, the Company, the Hugoton JV and its interest in GMDOC to the risk of claims and litigation
in the normal course of business. Other than as noted above in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in our Notes to the
Financial Statements or routine litigation arising out of the ordinary course of business, the Company is not presently subject to any
material litigation nor, to its knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against the Company. 

42 

Contractual
Obligations 

USNG
Letter Agreement - Pursuant to the USNG Letter Agreement, the Company is required to pay USNG a 8,000 monthly cash fee beginning
at the onset of commercial helium or minerals production and sales, subject to certain thresholds. Such monthly fees will become due
and payable for any month that the Company receives cash receipts in excess of 25,000 derived from the sale of noble gases and/or rare
earth elements/minerals. The Company has not yet achieved the 25,000 cash receipts threshold, therefore, there has been no payment or
accrual liability relative to this cash fee provision through December 31, 2022. 

Farmout
Agreement to Explore and Develop Unconventional Gas and Brine Materials in the Hugoton Gas Field - On
April 4, 2022, the Company acquired a 40 interest in a Farm-Out Agreement by and between Sunflower Exploration, LLC as the Farmee and
Scout Energy Partners as Farmor with regards to its oil and gas interests in the Hugoton Gas Field, located in Haskell and Finney Counties,
Kansas. The Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells and the Company has joined three other entities in the
Hugoton JV to explore for and develop potential oil, natural gas, noble gases and brine minerals on the properties underlying the Farmout
Agreement Farm-Out Agreement. 

The
Hugoton JV will utilize Scout Energy Partner s existing infrastructure assets, including water disposal, gas gathering and
helium processing. In addition, the Farmout Agreement provides the Hugoton JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of
helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, located in Grant County, Kansas, which will enable the Hugoton JV to market and sell
the helium produced at prevailing market prices. The first exploratory well was completed and commenced production and sales of
natural gas, natural gas liquids and helium on August 17, 2022 near Garden City, Kansas , The Company is continuing
to evaluate the initial flows of both natural gas, natural gas liquids and helium to determine its plan for additional wells on the farmout. 

Inflation
and Seasonality 

Inflation
in general has had a material effect on us during the year ended December 31, 2022 and we do believe that inflation will continue
to significantly impact our business during 2023 and perhaps beyond. We do not believe that our business is seasonal in nature. 

In
addition, our oil and gas lease operating expenses have been substantially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine,
which has restricted the supply of production pipe and other materials used in the drilling and rework of oil and gas wells. In addition,
experienced oil and gas service professionals have been in high demand in the oil and gas service sector and thereby increasing the cost
of oil and gas well services. We expect this trend to continue during 2023 and perhaps beyond. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

A
critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires
management to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results
of operations. Specifically, critical accounting estimates have the following attributes: 1) we are required to make assumptions about
matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and 2) different estimates we could reasonably have used, or changes in
the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Estimates
and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new
events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor
and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known. Based on a critical assessment of our accounting
policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that our financial
statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and present a meaningful
presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our
more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements: 

Note
1 Going Concern Analysis - In accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Presentation
of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern, we are required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that our financials are issued. When management
identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern it should consider whether
its plans to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate the substantial doubt. If conditions or events raise substantial
doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, but the substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of management s
plans, the entity should disclose information that enables user of financial statements to understand the principal events that raised
the substantial doubt, management s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events, and management s plans
that alleviated substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. 

43 

We
performed the analysis and our overall assessment was there were conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, which raised substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within the next year, but such doubt was not adequately mitigated by our plans
to address the substantial doubt as disclosed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. 

Note
2 Oil and Gas Properties and Equipment The Company was required to perform an allocation of the purchase price
for the acquisition of the Properties and to provide the estimated useful lives assigned to the related equipment purchased. 

In
addition, the accounting for, and disclosure of, oil and gas producing activities require that we choose between two alternatives under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ): the full cost method or the successful efforts method.
We adopted and use the full cost method of accounting, which involves capitalizing all exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition
costs. Once we incur costs, they are recorded in the depletable pool of proved properties or in unproved properties, collectively, the
full cost pool. Our unproved property costs, which include unproved oil and gas properties, properties under development, and major development
projects, were zero through December 31, 2022, and are not subject to depletion. We review our unproved oil and gas property costs on
a quarterly basis to assess for impairment and transfer unproved costs to proved properties as a result of extensions or discoveries
from drilling operations or determination that no proved reserves are attributable to such costs. We expect these costs to be evaluated
in one to seven years and transferred to the depletable portion of the full cost pool during that time. The full cost pool is comprised
of intangible drilling costs, lease and well equipment and exploration and development costs incurred plus acquired proved and unproved
leaseholds. 

Note
3 Investment in unconsolidated subsidiary GMDOC - The Company s investment in its unconsolidated subsidiary
- GMDOC requires that the Company assess its control over the operations of GMDOC. 

The
Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence,
but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee, GMDOC. Management s judgment regarding its level of influence
over the operations of GMDOC included considering key factors such as the Company s ownership interest, legal form of the investee,
its lack of participation in policy-making decisions and its lack of control over the day-to-day operations of GMDOC. 

Note
4 Debt Obligations The Company has issued various debt and equity securities that require the Company to estimate
the fair value of the debt, its embedded features and any related detachable warrants or other equity-related securities issued. Management
must make significant assumption/estimates in order to allocate the proceeds of the issuance of the convertible debt securities between
its debt and equity components. 

Note
6 Stock Options - The Company follows the fair value recognition provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ASC 718. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements for granted, modified, or settled stock options based
on estimated fair values. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option award, expected stock price volatility
and expected dividends. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. 

Note
7 Warrants - The Company has issued various debt and equity securities (including detachable warrants) that require the Company
to estimate the fair value of the debt, its embedded features and any related detachable warrants or other equity-related securities
issued. Management must make significant assumption/estimates in order to allocate the proceeds of the issuance of the convertible debt
securities between its debt and equity components. 

 Note
8 Income Taxes - Accounting for income taxes requires significant estimates and judgments on the part of management. Such
estimates and judgments include, but are not limited to, the effective tax rate anticipated to apply to tax differences that are expected
to reverse in the future, the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to realize the benefits of net deferred tax assets and
net operating losses currently recorded and the likelihood that tax positions taken in tax returns will be sustained on audit. 

Note
11 Warrant Derivative Liabilities - Accounting for warrant derivative liabilities requires significant estimates and judgments
on the part of management. The estimated fair value of the Company s warrant derivative liabilities, all of which were related
to the detachable warrants issued in connection with various notes payable, were estimated using a closed-ended option pricing model
utilizing assumptions related to the contractual term of the instruments, estimated volatility of the price of the Company s common
stock and current interest rates.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 American
Noble Gas Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of American Noble Gas Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the
two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December
31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Substantial
doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
1 to the accompanying financial statements, the Company must raise significant funds in order to pay its outstanding debt and meet its
other obligations, has a stockholders deficit and has a significant working capital deficit. These conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s evaluation of the events and conditions and
management s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 

We
determined that there are no critical audit matters.

per share, and/or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value per share, on an as-converted common stock basis, by
written consent in lieu of a special meeting of stockholders, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

Pursuant
to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, per share, of AMGAS-Nevada (the Common Stock ), (ii) each outstanding share of
the predecessor s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock automatically converted into one share of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock, par value per share of AMGAS-Nevada (the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ), and (iii) each outstanding
option, right or warrant to acquire shares of predecessor common stock converted into an option, right or warrant to acquire an equal
number of shares of AMGAS-Nevada Common Stock under the same terms and conditions as the original options, rights or warrants . 

Similar
to the shares of predecessor common stock prior to the merger, the shares of Common Stock are quoted on the OTCQB tier operated by the
OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol IFNY . In accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, each outstanding certificate
previously representing shares of the predecessor s common stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock automatically represents,
without any action of the predecessor s stockholders, the same number of shares of Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock, as applicable. 

Pursuant
to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the directors and officers of the predecessor company immediately prior to the merger became the
directors and officers of AMGAS-Nevada and continued their respective directorship or services with the Company on the same terms as
their respective directorship or service with the predecessor registrant immediately prior to the merger. 

As
a result of the merger, the internal affairs of the Company ceased to be subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law or governed
by the predecessor s Delaware Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and its bylaws. As of December 7, 2021, the effective date
of the merger, the Company is now subject to the Nevada Revised Statutes and is governed by the Company s Articles of Incorporation
as filed in the State of Nevada and the Company s Bylaws. 

. The Central Kansas Uplift Properties include the production and mineral rights/leasehold for oil and gas properties, subject
to overriding royalties to third parties, in the Central Kansas Uplift geological formation covering over contiguous acres (the
 Properties ). The purchase of the Properties included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of
11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater
injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the
Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet. 

We
commenced rework of the existing production wells after completion of the acquisition of the Properties and have performed testing and
evaluation of the existence of noble gas reserves on the Properties including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals/gases. Testing
of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided encouraging but not conclusive results and the Company has yet to determine the
possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties. The Company plans to assess the Properties existing oil
and gas reserves while continuing the evaluation of the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves and specifically
the noble gas reserves that the Properties may hold. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company changed its strategy regarding the Central Kansas Uplift considering the reduced net cash
flows from the sale of crude oil production. The reduction in net cash flows was attributable to lower spot crude oil prices during 2022
compared to 2021 and higher than anticipated operating costs related to the operation of the horizontal wells on the Properties. The
Company has shut down the horizontal production wells as of December 31, 2022 and is considering the deepening of the conventional wells
on the property to explore for helium and other noble gases that may be present in deeper producing zones. Accordingly, the Company has
recorded an impairment charge of 712,812 to reduce the capitalized tangible and intangible costs related to its Central Kansas Uplift
properties to zero as of December 31, 2022. 

Hugoton
Gas Field Farm-Out - On April 4, 2022, the Company acquired a 40 participation in a Farmout Agreement by and between
Sunflower Exploration, LLC as the Farmee and Scout Energy Partners as Farmor Scout 
with regards to its oil and gas interests in the Hugoton Gas Field, located in Haskell and Finney Counties, Kansas. The Company has
joined three other parties to explore for and develop potential oil, natural gas, noble gases and brine minerals on the properties
underlying the Farmout Agreement (collectively the Hugoton JV ). 

The
Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells, with the first exploratory well spudded on May 7, 2022. The Hugoton
JV will utilize Scout s existing infrastructure assets including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing. The Farmout
Agreement provides the Hugoton JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, which
will enable the Hugoton JV to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices. 

The
Hugoton JV also acquired the right to all brine minerals subject to a ten percent (10 royalty to Scout, across Finney and Haskell Counties.
Brine minerals are harvested from the formation water produced from active, and to be drilled, oil and gas wells and may include a variety
of dissolved minerals including bromine and iodine. The Hugoton JV plans to target brine minerals with commercial quantities of bromine
and iodine. The Company through the Hugoton JV is currently developing proprietary technology to recover brine minerals, particularly
with respect to bromine, which is well underway and has demonstrated recovery efficiency and is expected to be available for use in existing
and future development wells. 

The
Hugoton JV believes that its unconventional theory has not previously been targeted for exploration by historical operations in the
field. The initial exploratory well was spud on May 7, 2022 near Garden City, Kansas, with production casing set after testing and
completion logs identified at least two potential zones with substantial gas and helium reserves. The initial well was completed
upon the successful perforation across two lower intervals of the Chase group of formations. The fracture stimulation was completed
in two stages during June 2022. The well was connected to the pipeline and commenced commercial production and sales of natural gas,
natural gas liquids and helium on August 17, 2022. The Company is continuing to evaluate the initial flows of both natural gas and
helium to determine its plan for additional wells on the farmout. 

The
Company performed the ceiling test to assess potential impairment of the capitalized costs relative to its Hugoton Gas Field Project.
The ceiling test indicated an impairment charge of was required to reduce the total capitalized costs to as of December
31, 2022. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an impairment charge of to reduce the capitalized tangible and intangible costs
related to its Hugoton Gas Field properties to as of December 31, 2022. 

Investment
in GMDOC, LLC - On May 3, 2022, the Company entered into an operating agreement (the Operating Agreement pursuant
to which the Company acquired 17 (or of 28 limited liability membership interests (the Interests in GMDOC, LLC,
a Kansas limited liability company GMDOC ), for an aggregate purchase price of , and was subsequently admitted
as a member of GMDOC. 

With
respect to its cash capital contribution, the Company paid a non-refundable cash deposit for the membership interests in the amount of
 on May 3, 2022. The Company paid the remainder of the cash contribution for the membership interests, or , on May 16,
2022. The remainder of the Company s capital contribution, or , was financed by the Bank Loan (as defined below). 

GMDOC
had previously acquired 
of the working interests (the Acquisition in certain oil and gas leases (the GMDOC Leases from
Castelli Energy, L.L.C., an Oklahoma limited liability company Castelli ). The GMDOC Leases cover approximately 
acres located in Southern Kansas near the Oklahoma border. The GMDOC Leases currently produce approximately 100 barrels of oil per
day and 1.5 million cubic feet of natural gas per day on a gross basis. 

GMDOC
is managed by two members: Darrah Oil Company, LLC, and Grand Mesa Operating Company, (collectively the Managing Members ),
which also serve as the operating companies under the GMDOC Leases. 

The
Company will have significant financial commitments executing its planned exploration and development of the Properties and the Hugoton
Gas Field. The Company may find it necessary to raise substantial amounts of debt or equity capital to fund such exploration and development
activities and may seek offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the Properties in exchange for cash and
a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement. There can be no assurance that it will
be able to obtain such new funding or be able to reach agreements with industry operators and other third parties or on what terms. 

Due
to the uncertainties related to the foregoing matters, there exists substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern within one year after the date the financials are issued. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities
that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

per bank. The Company minimizes this risk by placing its cash deposits
with several financial institutions if necessary to remain below the federally insured limit of per bank. At December 31, 2022
and December 31, 2021, the uninsured balance amounted to - - and , respectively. 

The
amendments in ASU 2020-06 are effective for public entities that meet the definition of an SEC filer, excluding smaller reporting companies
as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. 

The
Company early adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2021 and has applied its effects to the convertible notes payable issued on
March 31, 2021 and the convertible notes payable issued on August 30, 2021 (see Note 4). The Company elected to adopt ASU 2020-06
using the modified retrospective method which enables entities to apply the transition requirements in this ASU at the effective date
of ASU 2020-06 (rather than as of the earliest comparative period presented) with the effect of initially adopting ASU 2020-06 recognized
as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings (accumulated deficit) on the first day of the period adopted. Therefore, this
transition method applies the amendments in ASU 2020-06 to outstanding financial instruments as of the beginning of the fiscal year of
adoption (January 1, 2021), with the cumulative effect of the change recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings
(accumulated deficit) as of the date of adoption. In accordance with the modified retrospective method, no adjustment was made to the
comparative-period information including earnings (loss) per share. 

The
Company applied ASU-2020-06 to all outstanding financial instruments as of January 1, 2021, (the date of adoption of ASU 2020-06). The
convertible notes payable issued on August 19, 2020 was the only outstanding financial instrument effected by this new accounting standard
as of January 1, 2021. Therefore, the application of ASU-2020-06 to this convertible note payable was used to determine the cumulative
effect of the adoption of the new accounting standard. The cumulative effect of the adoption of the new accounting standard was recognized
as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (accumulated deficit) which resulted in an increase to the carrying value
of convertible notes payable as of January 1, 2021 of , a decrease to additional paid in capital of and a decrease to
accumulated deficit of . See Note 4. 

Prior
to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company applied the existing accounting standards for derivatives and hedging and for distinguishing
liabilities from equity when accounting for hybrid contracts that feature conversion options. The accounting standards require companies
to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments according
to certain criteria. The criteria includes circumstances in which (i) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative
instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (ii) the hybrid instrument
that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable
generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (iii) a separate instrument
with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. The derivative is subsequently
marked to market at each reporting date based on current fair value, with the changes in fair value reported in results of operations. 

Conversion
options that contain variable settlement features such as provisions to adjust the conversion price upon subsequent issuances of equity
or equity linked securities at exercise prices more favorable than that featured in the hybrid contract generally result in their bifurcation
from the host instrument. 

As
a result of certain terms, conditions and features included in certain common stock purchase warrants issued by the Company (Note 4 and
13), those warrants were required to be accounted for as derivatives at estimated fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in
operations.

. The purchase of the Properties included the existing production equipment, infrastructure
and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal
saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce
from the Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet. 

The
Company has performed workovers of the wells subsequent to the Properties purchase which was necessary to put the lease back into production
status. Therefore, these tangible and intangible workover costs were expensed as lease operating expenses rather than capitalized in
the full cost pool through December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company is currently evaluating the Properties for oil and gas reserves
and specifically the potential for noble gas reserves such as helium, argon and krypton. Based on these evaluations, the Company may
redirect its efforts to the production of noble gases rather than crude oil on the Properties. These noble gas evaluation costs have
also been expensed as lease operating costs through December 31, 2022. 

Hugoton
Gas Field Farm-Out -The first exploratory well commenced on May 7, 2022 near Garden City, Kansas with a goal to evaluate its unconventional
theory of where substantial oil, natural gas and noble gases may be present in the Hugoton Gas Field. The initial well in which the Company
has acquired a 40 participation together with three other venture partners was spud on May 7, 2022 with production casing set after
testing and completion logs identified at least two potential zones with substantial gas and helium reserves. 

The
initial well was completed upon the successful perforation across two lower intervals of the Chase group of formations. The fracture
stimulation was completed in two stages during June 2022. The well was connected to the pipeline and commenced commercial production
on August 17, 2022. The Company is continuing to evaluate the initial flows of both natural gas and helium to determine its plan for
additional wells on the farmout. 

When
we acquire significant amounts of undeveloped acreage, we capitalize interest on the acquisition costs in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic
835-20 for Capitalization of Interest. When the unproved property costs are moved to proved developed and undeveloped oil and gas properties,
or the properties are sold, we cease capitalizing interest. 

Capitalized
costs to acquire oil and natural gas properties are depreciated and depleted on a units-of-production basis based on estimated proved
reserves. Capitalized costs of exploratory wells and development costs are depreciated and depleted on a units-of-production basis based
on estimated proved developed reserves. Under this method, the sum of the full cost pool, excluding the book value of unproved properties,
and all estimated future development costs are divided by the total estimated quantities of proved reserves. This rate is applied to
our total production for the quarter, and the appropriate expense is recorded. Support equipment and other property, plant and equipment
related to oil and gas producing activities, as well as property, plant and equipment unrelated to oil and gas producing activities,
are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 

Sales,
dispositions and other oil and gas property retirements are accounted for as adjustments to the full cost pool, with no recognition of
gain or loss, unless the disposition would significantly alter the amortization rate and/or the relationship between capitalized costs
and Proved Reserves. 

Pursuant
to Rule 4-10(c)(4) of Regulation S-X, at the end of each quarterly period, companies that use the full cost method of accounting for
their oil and gas properties must compute a limitation on capitalized costs, or ceiling test. The ceiling test involves comparing the
net book value of the full cost pool, after taxes, to the full cost ceiling limitation defined below. In the event the full cost ceiling
is less than the full cost pool, we must record a ceiling test write-down of our oil and gas properties to the value of the full cost
ceiling. The full cost ceiling limitation is computed as the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues from our proved
reserves by applying average prices as prescribed by the SEC Release No. 33-8995, less estimated future expenditures (based on current
costs) to develop and produce the proved reserves, discounted at 10 , plus the cost of properties not being amortized and the lower of
cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of income tax effects. 

The
ceiling test is computed using the simple average spot price for the trailing twelve-month period using the first day of each month.
The trailing twelve-month reference price was 
per barrel for the West Texas Intermediate oil at Cushing, Oklahoma through December 31, 2021. This reference price for oil is
further adjusted for quality factors and regional differentials to derive estimated future net revenues. Under full cost accounting
rules, any ceiling test write-downs of oil and gas properties may not be reversed in subsequent periods. We recognized an impairment
charge of as of December 31, 2022 which is attributable to changing our strategy to exploring for noble gases and away from
crude oil production at our Central Kansas Uplift properties which resulted in a large decrease in estimated future cash flows. The
accumulated impairment charges relative to ceiling test write-downs of our oil and gas properties was through
December 31, 2022. 

The
ceiling test calculation is based upon estimates of proved reserves. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities
of proved reserves, in projecting the future rates of production and in the timing of development activities. The accuracy of any reserve
estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling,
testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate. Accordingly, reserve estimates are
often different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. 

of the stock in Infinity-Texas in 2012. The Company has recognized an additional liability of related
to its former Texas oil and gas producing properties (included in asset retirement obligations) to recognize the potential personal liability
of the Company and its officers for the Infinity-Texas oil and gas properties should the new owner not perform its obligations to reclaim
abandoned wells in a timely manner. In addition, management believes the Company has been relieved from asset retirement obligations
related to Infinity-Wyoming because of the sale of its Wyoming and Colorado oil and gas properties in 2008; however, the Company has
recognized since 2012 an additional liability of related to its former Wyoming and Colorado oil and gas producing properties
(included in asset retirement obligations) to recognize the potential liability of the Company and its officers should the new owner
not perform its obligations to reclaim abandoned wells in a timely manner. 

- at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

The
Company is potentially subject to taxation in many jurisdictions, and the calculation of income tax liabilities (if any) involves dealing
with uncertainties in the application of complex income tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. It recognizes certain
income tax positions that meet a more-likely-than not recognition threshold. If the Company ultimately determines that the payment of
these liabilities will be unnecessary, it will reverse the liability and recognize an income tax benefit. liability for unrecognized
tax benefit was recorded as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Great
Bend Properties - On April 1, 2021, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of certain oil and gas properties
and interests from Core Energy, LLC Core ), effective as of January 1, 2021 (the Great Bend Properties Acquisition ).
On December 14, 2020, the Company entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement (the Agreement with Core Energy, as
well as all of the members of Core, Mandalay LLC and Coal Creek Energy, LLC, to purchase certain oil and gas properties in the Central
Kansas Uplift geological formation, covering over contiguous acres, including, among other things, the production and mineral
rights to and a leasehold interest in the Properties and all contracts, agreements and instruments. The Agreement provided for an aggregate
purchase price consisting of in cash at closing. 

The
following represents the purchase price allocation for the Great Bend Properties Acquisition for in cash. The Great Bend Properties
Acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition. As such, the Company recognized the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair
values as of April 1, 2021, the date of closing. The fair value of the Properties acquired approximate the value of the consideration
paid, and the asset retirement obligation to be assumed, which management has concluded approximates the fair value that would be paid
by a typical market participant. As a result, neither goodwill nor a bargain purchase gain will be recognized related to the acquisition. 

The
Company determined the amount of the asset retirement obligation assumed to be as of the date of acquisition. The obligation
relates to legal requirements associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisitions, construction, development,
or normal use of the asset. The obligation relates primarily to the requirement to plug and abandon oil and natural gas wells and support
wells at the conclusion of their useful lives.

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company changed its strategy regarding the Central Kansas Uplift considering the reduced net cash
flows from the sale of crude oil production. The reduction in net cash flows was attributable to lower spot crude oil prices during 2022
compared to 2021 and higher than anticipated operating costs related to the operation of the horizontal wells on the Properties. The
Company has shut down the horizontal production wells as of December 31, 2022 and is considering the deepening of the conventional wells
on the property to explore for helium and other noble gases that may be present in deeper producing zones. Accordingly, the Company has
recorded an impairment charge of to reduce the capitalized tangible and intangible costs related to its Central Kansas Uplift
properties to zero as of December 31, 2022. 

Hugoton
Gas Field Participation Agreement - On April 4, 2022, the Company acquired a participation
in a Farmout Agreement by and between Sunflower Exploration, LLC as the Farmee and Scout Energy Partners as Farmor with regards to its
oil and gas interests in the Hugoton Gas Field, located in Haskell and Finney Counties, Kansas. The Company has joined three other parties
in the Hugoton JV to explore for and develop potential oil, natural gas, noble gases and brine minerals on the properties underlying
the Farmout Agreement. 

The
Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells, with the first exploratory well spudded on May 7, 2022. The Hugoton
JV will utilize Scout s existing infrastructure assets including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing. The Farmout
Agreement provides the Hugoton JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, which
will enable the Hugoton JV to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices. 

The
Hugoton JV also acquired the right to all brine minerals subject to a ten percent royalty to Scout, across Finney and Haskell Counties.
Brine minerals are harvested from the formation water produced from active, and to be drilled, oil and gas wells and may include a variety
of dissolved minerals including bromine and iodine. 

The
Hugoton JV believes that its unconventional theory has not previously been targeted for exploration by historical operations in the
field. The initial exploratory well was spud on May 7, 2022 near Garden City, Kansas with production casing set after testing and
completion logs identified at least two potential zones with substantial gas and helium reserves. The initial well was completed
upon the successful perforation across two lower intervals of the Chase group of formations. The fracture stimulation was completed
in two stages during June 2022. The well was connected to the pipeline and commenced commercial production and sales of natural gas,
natural gas liquids and helium on August 17, 2022. The Company is continuing to evaluate the initial flows of both natural gas and
helium to determine its plan for additional wells on the farmout. 

The
Company has paid a total of for its participation in the drilling and completion of the initial exploratory well. Such amount
was an estimate and will be adjusted to actual drilling and completion cost expenditures when the well is connected to the pipeline and
the production of gas commences. 

The
Company performed the ceiling test to assess for potential impairment of the capitalized costs relative to the Hugoton Gas Field Project.
The ceiling test indicated an impairment charge of was required to reduce the total capitalized costs to as of December
31, 2022. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an impairment charge of to reduce the capitalized tangible and intangible costs
related to its Hugoton Gas Field properties to as of December 31, 2022.

2021 Plan and the 2015 Plan provide for under which both incentive and non-statutory stock options may be granted to employees, officers,
non-employee directors and consultants. An aggregate of shares of the Company s Common Stock is reserved for issuance
under the 2021 Plan and the 2015 Plan. Options granted under the 2021 Plan and 2015 Plan allow for the purchase of shares of Common Stock
at prices not less than the fair market value of such stock at the date of grant, become exercisable immediately or as directed by the
Company s Board of Directors and generally expire ten years after the date of grant. The Company has issued stock options and restricted
stock awards that are not pursuant to a formal plan with terms similar to the 2021 and 2015 Plans. 

As
of December 31, 2022, shares were available for future grants under the 2021 Plan and the 2015 Plan. 

The
fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input
of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option award, expected stock price volatility and expected dividends. These
estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. For purposes of estimating the expected term of
options granted, the Company aggregates option recipients into groups that have similar option exercise behavioral traits. Expected volatilities
used in the valuation model are based on the expected volatility based on historical volatility. The risk-free rate for the expected
term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company s forfeiture rate assumption
used in determining its stock-based compensation expense is estimated based on historical data. The actual forfeiture rate could differ
from these estimates. There were options granted during June 2021.

Warrants
issued pursuant to USNG Letter Agreement 

On
November 9, 2021, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the USNG Letter Agreement with U.S. Noble Gas, LLC USNG ),
pursuant to which USNG provides consulting services to the Company for exploration, testing, refining, production, marketing and distribution
of various potential reserves of noble gases and rare earth element/minerals on the Company s recently acquired -acre oil
and gas properties in the Otis Albert Field located on the Properties. The USNG Letter Agreement would cover all of the noble gases,
specifically including helium, and rare earth elements/minerals potentially existing on Properties and the Company s future acquisitions,
if any, including the Hugoton Gas Field. 

The
USNG Letter Agreement also provides that USNG will supply a large vessel designed for flows up to barrels of water per day at low
pressures, known as a gas extraction/separator unit. The gas extraction/separator unit is a dewatering vessel that the Company may use
for multiple wells in the future. 

The
USNG Letter Agreement requires the Company to establish a four-member board of advisors (the Board of Advisors comprised
of various experts involved in noble gas and rare earth elements/minerals. The Board of Advisors will help attract both industry partners
and financial partners for developing a large helium, noble gas and/or rare earth element/mineral resources that may exist in the region
where the Company currently operates. The industry partners would include helium, noble gas and/or rare earth element/mineral purchasers
and exploration and development companies from the energy industry. The financial partners may include large family offices or small
institutions. 

Pursuant
to the USNG Letter Agreement, the Company will pay USNG a monthly cash fee equal to per month beginning at the onset of commercial
helium or minerals production and sales, subject to certain thresholds. Such monthly fees will become due and payable for any month that
the Company receives cash receipts in excess of derived from the sale of noble gases and/or rare earth elements/minerals. The
Company has not yet achieved the cash receipts threshold, therefore, there has been payment or accrual liability relative
to this cash fee provision as of December 31, 2022. 

The
USNG Letter Agreement has an initial term of years, which shall thereafter continue for successive one-year periods, provided that
there is no uncured breach, unless otherwise terminated by either party upon a written notice of intent to non-renew. 

In
consideration for the consulting services to be rendered and pursuant to the terms of the USNG Letter Agreement, the Company issued warrants
to purchase, in the aggregate, shares of its Common Stock at an exercise price of fifty cents to three of USNG s
principal consultants and four third-party service providers. The Company issued warrants to purchase, in the aggregate, shares
of Common Stock at fifty cents per share exercise price to three members of the Board of Advisors. The Company granted a total
of warrants to purchase its Common Stock with an exercise price of fifty cents per share in connection with the USNG
Letter Agreement and the arrangements described therein. The warrants expire after the date of the USNG Letter Agreement. 

The
fair value of the warrants to purchase Common Stock in consideration for services to be rendered under the USNG Letter Agreement with
USNG is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions,
including the expected term of the warrant, expected stock price volatility and expected dividends. These estimates involve inherent
uncertainties and the application of management judgment. For purposes of estimating the expected term of warrants granted, the Company
considered the historical pattern of warrant exercises behavioral traits and determined that the expected term should be . Expected
volatilities used in the valuation model are based on the expected volatility based on historical volatility. The risk-free rate for
the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company s forfeiture
rate assumption used in determining its stock-based compensation expense is estimated based on historical data. The actual forfeiture
rate could differ from these estimates.

Deferred tax asset 

The
effective income tax rate on earnings (loss) before income tax benefit varies from the statutory federal income tax rate primarily
due to Company providing a reserve on its net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company increased its valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets by while the valuation
allowance remained at of all net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. . Accordingly, the Company determined there was not sufficient positive evidence regarding
its potential for future profits to outweigh the negative evidence of our three-year cumulative loss position under the guidance provided
in ASC 740. Therefore, it determined to continue to provide a valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets. The Company expects
to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until it determines that it can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates
its ability to realize these assets. To the extent the Company determines that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more
likely than not based upon expected future taxable income, a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed. 

For
income tax purposes, the Company has net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately as of December 31, 2022, which . 

For
income tax purposes, the Company has net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately in accordance with its 2022 federal
income tax return as filed. Approximately of such net operating loss carry-forwards while 
of such net operating loss carry-forwards have an indefinite carryforward period in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017,
as amended (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ). . 

The
Company has recently completed the filing of tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 2021. Therefore, all such tax returns are open
to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. 

The
Internal Revenue Code contains provisions under Section 382 which limit a company s ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards
in the event that it has experienced a more than change in ownership over a three-year period. Management has completed its review
of whether such ownership changes have occurred, and based upon such review, management believes that the Company is not currently subject
to an annual limitation or the possibility of the complete elimination of the net operating loss carry- forwards. In addition, the Company
may be limited by additional ownership changes which may occur in the future.

Loss
from retirement of convertible note payable - On March 26, 2021, the Company exercised its right to retire a convertible note

The
 asset retirement obligation existing at December 31, 2022 and in years prior to 2022 represented the remaining potential liability
for wells the Company had owned in Texas and Wyoming prior to their sales/disposal in 2012. The Company was not in compliance with then
existing federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations for its previously owned Texas and Wyoming domestic oil and gas properties.
All domestic oil and gas properties held by Infinity Wyoming and Infinity-Texas were disposed of in 2012 and in years prior to
2012; however, the Company may remain liable for certain asset retirement costs should the new owners not complete their asset retirement
obligations. Management believes the asset retirement obligations recorded relative to these Texas and Wyoming wells of as
of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are sufficient to cover any potential noncompliance liabilities relative to the plugging of abandoned wells,
the removal of facilities and equipment, and site restoration on oil and gas properties for its former oil and gas properties. 

The
Company assumed a asset retirement obligation pursuant to the acquisition of the Properties on April 1, 2021. In addition, the
Company drilled and completed its first Hugoton Gas Field well which was placed in service in August 2022. The Company recorded

USNG
Letter Agreement commitment 

Pursuant
to the USNG Letter Agreement (see Note 7), the Company will pay USNG a monthly cash fee equal to per month beginning at the onset
of commercial helium or minerals production and sales, subject to certain thresholds. Such monthly fees will become due and payable for
any month that the Company receives cash receipts in excess of derived from the sale of noble gases and/or rare earth elements/minerals.
The Company has not yet achieved the cash receipts threshold, therefore there has been no payment or accrual liability relative
to this cash fee provision as of December 31, 2022. 

The
USNG Letter Agreement has an initial term of years, which shall thereafter continue for successive one-year periods, provided that
there is no uncured breach, unless otherwise terminated by either party upon a written notice of intent to non-renew. 

Litigation 

The
Company is subject to various claims and legal actions in which vendors are claiming breach of contract due to the Company s failure
to pay amounts due. The Company believes that it has made adequate provision for these claims in the accompanying financial statements. 

The
Company is currently involved in litigation as follows: 

In
 October 2012, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit naming Infinity-Texas, the Company and the corporate officers of Infinity-Texas,
 seeking of reclamation costs associated with a single well, in addition to administrative expenses and penalties. The Company
 engaged in negotiations with the State of Texas in late 2012 and early 2013 and reached a settlement agreement that would reduce
 the aggregate liability, in this action and any extension of this action to other Texas wells, to , which amount has been
 paid. Certain performance obligations remain which must be satisfied in order to finally settle and dismiss the matter. 

Pending
 satisfactory performance of the performance obligations and their acceptance by the State of Texas, the Company s officers
 have potential liability regarding the above matter, and the Company s officers are held personally harmless by indemnification
 provisions of the Company. Therefore, to the extent they might actually occur, these liabilities are the obligations of the Company.
 , calculated as 30,000 for each of
 the 26 Infinity-Texas operated wells . This related liability, less the payment made to the State of Texas in 2012 in the amount of
 , is included in the asset retirement obligation on the accompanying balance sheets, which management believes is sufficient
 to provide for the ultimate resolution of this dispute. 

Cambrian
 Consultants America, Inc. Cambrian filed an action in the District Court of Harris County, Texas, number CV2014-55719,
 on September 26, 2014 against the Company resulting from certain professional consulting services provided for quality control and
 management of seismic operations during November and December 2013 on the Nicaraguan Concessions. Cambrian provided these services
 pursuant to a Master Consulting Agreement with the Company, dated November 20, 2013, and has claimed breach of contract for failure
 to pay amounts due. On December 8, 2014, a default judgment was entered against the Company in the amount of plus interest
 and attorney fees. The Company has included the impact of this litigation as a liability in its accounts payable, which management
 believes is sufficient to provide for the ultimate resolution of this dispute. 

Torrey
 Hills Capital, Inc. Torrey notified the Company by letter, dated August 15, 2014, of its demand for the payment of
 , which it alleged was unpaid and owed under a consulting agreement dated October 18, 2013. The parties entered into a consulting
 agreement under which Torrey agreed to provide investor relations services in exchange for payment of per month and the issuance
 of shares of Common Stock. The agreement was for an initial three month-term with automatic renewals unless terminated upon
 30 days written notice by either party. The Company made payments totaling and issued shares of Common Stock
 during 2013. The Company contends that Torrey breached the agreement by not performing the required services and that it had provided
 proper notice of termination to Torrey. Furthermore, the Company contends that the parties agreed to settle the dispute on or about
 June 19, 2014 under which it would issue shares of Common Stock in full settlement of any balance then owed and final termination
 of the agreement. Torrey disputed the Company s contentions and submitted the dispute to binding arbitration. The Company was
 unable to defend itself and the arbitration panel awarded Torrey a total of in damages. The Company has accrued this amount
 in accounts payable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, which management believes is sufficient to provide for the ultimate resolution
 of this dispute.

contiguous acres, including, among other things, the production and mineral rights to and a leasehold interest in the Oil Gas
Properties and all contracts, agreements and instruments. The Company acquired the Oil Gas Properties for an aggregate

On
April 4, 2022, the Company acquired a participation in a Farmout Agreement by and between Sunflower Exploration, LLC as the Farmee
and Scout Energy Partners as Farmor with regards to its oil and gas interests in the Hugoton Gas Field, located in Haskell and Finney
Counties, Kansas. The Company has joined three other parties in the Hugoton JV to explore for and develop potential oil, natural gas,
noble gases and brine minerals on the properties underlying the Farmout Agreement. 

The
Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells, with the first exploratory well spudded on May 7, 2022. The Hugoton
JV will utilize Scout s existing infrastructure assets including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing. The Farmout
Agreement provides the Hugoton JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, which
will enable the Hugoton JV to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices. 

The
Hugoton JV also acquired the right to all brine minerals subject to a ten percent royalty to Scout, across Finney and Haskell Counties. Brine minerals are harvested from the formation water produced from active, and
to be drilled, oil and gas wells and may include a variety of dissolved minerals including bromine and iodine. 

The
Company has paid a total of for its participation in the drilling and completion of the initial exploratory well. Such amount
was an estimate and will be adjusted to actual drilling and completion cost expenditures when the well is connected to the pipeline and
the production of gas commences. 

The
following tables summarize the net ownership interest in the proved oil and gas reserves and the standardized measure of discounted
future net cash flows related to the proved oil and gas reserves for the Oil Gas Properties and the Hugoton Gas Field. The
estimates were prepared by the Company based on the reserve reports prepared for the Company for the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021. The standardized measure presented here excludes income taxes as the tax basis for the Oil Gas Properties and the
Hugoton Gas Field is not applicable due to the substantial net operating loss carryforwards available to the Company on a go-forward
basis. The proved oil and gas reserve estimates and other components of the standardized measure were determined in accordance with
the authoritative guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC. 

Proved
Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities 

Proved
reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with
reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic
conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be
recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is
relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be
recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for
recompletion. The net proved oil and gas reserves and changes in net proved oil and gas reserves attributable to the Oil Gas
Properties with respect to crude oil, and the Hugoton Gas Field which produces natural gas, natural gas liquids and helium all of
which are located in the state of Kansas, are summarized below:

Standard measure of discounted future net cash flows 

Requirements
for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure require that reserve estimates and future cash flows be based on the average market
prices for sales of oil and gas on the first calendar day of each month during the year. The average prices used for the year ended December
31, 2022 and 2021 under these rules were 
 and 
 for crude oil, respectively. The average prices
used for the year ended December 31, 2022 under these rules were 
per MCF for natural gas and 
 per gallon for natural gas liquids and 
 per MCF for helium, respectively. 

Future
operating expenses and development costs are computed primarily by the Company s petroleum engineers by estimating the expenditures
to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year, based on year end costs and assuming
continuation of existing economic conditions. As mentioned above, the standardized measure presented here does not include the effects
of income taxes as the tax basis for the oil gas properties due to the substantial tax net operating loss carryforwards available
to the Company which makes its use non-applicable on a go-forward basis. A discount factor of was used to reflect the timing of future
net cash flows. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is not intended to represent the replacement cost or fair
value of the Company s oil gas properties. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, the
recovery of reserves not presently classified as proved, anticipated future changes in prices and costs, and a discount factor more representative
of the time value of money and the risks inherent in oil and gas reserve estimates.

During
2022, the Company incurred of exploration costs when it drilled its pilot well in the Hugoton Gas Field which was
successfully completed and is producing and selling commercial quantities of natural gas, natural gas liquids and helium. During
2021 the Company incurred 
in development costs on the Kansas Oil Gas Properties in 2021 primarily to assess the potential of noble gas and rare earth
mineral reserves. Such exploration included noble gases such as helium and argon and rare earth minerals included bromine, lithium
and iodine. The Company is assessing the results of such tests to determine whether commercial amounts of reserves exist that can be
profitably extracted on the Kansas Oil Gas Properties.

The exploration costs relative
the Hugoton Gas Field pilot well during the year ended December 31, 2022 was allocated to proved oil and gas properties with
 to leasehold costs and representing tangible equipment. The acquisition price
of the Properties in 2021 was allocated to tangible equipment and seismic data acquired as part of the acquisition. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company
changed its strategy regarding the Central Kansas Uplift considering the reduced net cash flows from the sale of crude oil production.
The reduction in net cash flows was attributable to lower spot crude oil prices during 2022 compared to 2021 and higher than anticipated
operating costs related to the operation of the horizontal wells on the Properties. The Company has shut down the horizontal production
wells as of December 31, 2022 and is considering the deepening of the conventional wells on the property to explore for helium and other
noble gases that may be present in deeper producing zones. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an impairment charge of to
reduce the capitalized tangible and intangible costs related to its Central Kansas Uplift properties to zero as of December 31, 2022.

The Company performed the ceiling test to assess
potential impairment of the capitalized costs relative to its Hugoton Gas Field Project. The ceiling test indicated an impairment charge
of was required to reduce the total capitalized costs to as of December 31, 2022. Accordingly, the Company has recorded
an impairment charge of to reduce the capitalized tangible and intangible costs related to its Hugoton Gas Field properties
to 88,687 as of December 31, 2022.

9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable
assurance of achieving the control objectives, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based
on their evaluation as of December 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in assuring
that financial statement presentation and disclosure are in conformity with those which are required to be included in our periodic SEC
filings. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies
and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
 of our management and directors; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

All
internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In
connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework . Based on our assessment using those criteria,
management believes that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to material weaknesses
identified as follows: 

(a) 
 Lack
 of control processes in place that provide multiple levels of review and supervision and 

(b) 
 Lack
 of segregation of duties. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 

Internal
control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even a system which is determined to
be effective cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected or prevented. Our systems of internal controls
are designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Family
Relationships 

There
is no family relationship between any of our directors, director nominees and executive officers. 

Board
of Directors and Committee Meetings 

Our
Board held one meeting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Our directors attended all the meetings of the Board. Our directors
are expected, absent exceptional circumstances, to attend all Board meetings. 

Committees
of the Board 

We
do not have Audit, Compensation or Nominating and Governance Committees. Our full Board discharges the duties that such committees would
normally have. We do not have such committees because of our stage of operations and because our Board consists of only three members. 

Our
full Board is comprised of three Directors, one of whom is independent, as defined by the rules and regulations of the SEC. The members
of our Board are Stanton E. Ross, Leroy C. Richie and Daniel F. Hutchins. The Board determined that Mr. Richie qualifies as an audit
committee financial expert, as defined under the rules and regulations of the SEC 
and is independent as noted above. 

Stanton
E. Ross, Leroy C. Richie and Daniel F. Hutchins are the directors of the Company. Messrs. Ross and Hutchins are not considered independent 
in accordance with Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. The Board has determined that Mr. Richie is independent in accordance
with the NASDAQ and SEC rules. We are currently traded on the OTC QB, which does not require that a majority of the board be independent.
If we ever become an issuer whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange or on an automated inter-dealer quotation system
of a national securities association, which has independent director requirements, we intend to comply with all applicable requirements
relating to director independence. 

Under
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, all audit and non-audit services performed by the Company s independent registered accounting firms
must be approved in advance by the Board to assure that such services do not impair the independent registered accounting firms 
independence from the Company. Our full Board performs the equivalent functions of an audit committee, therefore, no policies or procedures
other than those required by SEC rules on auditor independence, have been implemented.

Report
of the Board Serving the Equivalent Functions of an Audit Committee 

Review
and Discussion with Management 

Our
Board has reviewed and discussed with management our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the process
designed to achieve compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and our assessment of internal control over financial
reporting. 

Review
and Discussions with Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Our
Board has discussed with RBSM, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal years ended 2022 and 2021, the matters
the Board, serving the equivalent functions of an audit committee, is required to discuss. Specifically, the Board has discussed with
the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board s
Auditing AS 1301 (Communications With Audit Committees), as modified or supplemented. The discussions occurred with management and the
independent public accountants about the quality (and not merely the acceptability) of the Company s accounting principles, the
reasonableness of significant estimates, judgments and the transparency of disclosures in the Company s financial statements. 

The
Board has also received written disclosures in a letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable
requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm s independence,
and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm their independence from the Company and its management. This
review also includes discussions of audit and non-audit fees as well as evaluation of the Company s significant financial policies
and accounting systems and controls. 

The
Board has also reviewed the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm considering the compatibility of non-audit
services with maintaining their independence from the Company. Based on the preceding review and discussions contained in this paragraph,
the Board recommended that the audited financial statements be included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2022, for filing with the SEC . 

Conclusion 

Based
on the review and discussions referred to above, the Board, serving the equivalent functions of the audit committee, approved our audited
financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2022 for filing with the SEC . 

Board s
Role in the Oversight of Risk Management 

We
face a variety of risks, including credit, liquidity and operational risks. In fulfilling its risk oversight role, our Board focuses
on the adequacy of our risk management process and overall risk management system. Our Board believes that an effective risk management
system will (i) adequately identify the material risks that we face in a timely manner; (ii) implement appropriate risk management strategies
that are responsive to our risk profile and specific material risk exposures; (iii) integrate consideration of risk and risk management
into our business decision-making; and (iv) include policies and procedures that adequately transmit necessary information regarding
material risks to senior executives and, as appropriate, to the Board or relevant committee. 

Our
Board oversees risk management for us. Accordingly, the Board schedules time for periodic review of risk management, in addition to its
other duties. In this role, the Board receives reports from management, certified public accountants, outside legal counsel, and to the
extent necessary, from other advisors, and strives to generate serious and thoughtful attention to our risk management process and system,
the nature of the material risks we face, and the adequacy of our policies and procedures designed to respond to and mitigate these risks. 

49 

Board
Leadership Structure 

Our
Board has a Chairman of the Board. Our Board does not have a policy on whether or not the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
of the Board should be separate and, if they are to be separate, whether the Chairman of the Board should be selected from the non-employee
directors or be an employee. Our Board believes that it should be free to make a choice from time to time in any manner that is in the
best interests of us and our stockholders. The Board believes that Mr. Ross s service as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
of the Board is in the best interests of us and our stockholders. Mr. Ross possesses detailed and in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities
and challenges we face and is thus best positioned to develop agendas, with the input of the other directors that ensure that the Board s
time and attention are focused on the most critical matters. His combined role enables decisive leadership, ensures clear accountability,
and enhances our ability to communicate our message and strategy clearly and consistently to our stockholders, employees, customers and
suppliers, particularly given the issues and other challenges the Company has faced in recent years. Our Board has determined that our
Board leadership structure is appropriate given the size of our Board and the nature of our business. 

Stockholder
Communications with the Board 

Stockholders
may communicate with the Board by writing to us as follows: American Noble Gas Inc. attention: Corporate Secretary, 15612 College Blvd.,
Overland Park, KS 66210. Stockholders who would like their submission directed to a particular member of the Board may so specify and
the communication will be forwarded as appropriate. 

Prohibition
on Hedging 

The
Company prohibit members of our Board and our officers from engaging in hedging transactions involving our securities. 

Process
and Policy for Director Nominations 

Our
full Board will consider candidates for Board membership suggested by Board members, management and our stockholders. In evaluating the
suitability of potential nominees for membership on the Board, the Board members will consider the Board s current composition,
including expertise, diversity, and balance of inside, outside and independent directors. The Board considers the general qualifications
of the potential nominees, including integrity and honesty; recognized leadership in business or professional activity; a background
and experience that will complement the talents of the other board members; the willingness and capability to take the time to actively
participate in board and committee meetings and related activities; the extent to which the candidate possesses pertinent technological,
political, business, financial or social/cultural expertise and experience; the absence of realistic possibilities of conflict of interest
or legal prohibition; the ability to work well with the other directors; and the extent of the candidate s familiarity with issues
affecting our business. 

While
the Board considers diversity and variety of experiences and viewpoints to be important factors, it does not believe that a director
nominee should be chosen solely or mainly because of race, color, gender, national origin or sexual identity or orientation. Thus, although
diversity may be a consideration in the Board s process, it does not have a formal policy regarding the consideration of diversity
in identifying director nominees. 

50 

Stockholder
Recommendations for Director Nominations. Our Board does not have a formal policy with respect to consideration of any director candidate
recommendation by stockholders. While the Board may consider candidates recommended by stockholders, it has no requirement to do so.
To date, no stockholder has recommended a candidate for nomination to the Board. Given that we have not received director nominations
from stockholders in the past and that we do not canvass stockholders for such nominations, we believe it is appropriate not to have
a formal policy in that regard. We do not pay a fee to any third party to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating
potential nominees. 

Stockholder
recommendations for director nominations may be submitted to the Company at the following address: American Noble Gas Inc, attention:
Corporate Secretary, 15612 College Blvd., Overland Park, KS 66210. Such recommendations will be forwarded to the Board for consideration,
provided that they are accompanied by sufficient information to permit the Board to evaluate the qualifications and experience of the
nominees, and provided that they are in time for the Board to do an adequate evaluation of the candidate before the annual meeting of
stockholders. The submission must be accomplished by a written consent of the individual to stand for election if nominated by the Board
and to serve if elected and to cooperate with a background check. 

Stockholder
Nominations of Directors. The bylaws of the Company provide that in order for a stockholder to nominate a director at an annual meeting,
the stockholder must give timely, written notice to the Secretary of the Company and such notice must be received at the principal executive
offices of the Company not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the date of the meeting. If public disclosure of the date
of the meeting is made less than 100 days prior to the date of the meeting, a stockholder s notice must be received not later than
the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public disclosure of the date of the meeting was made. With respect
to a special meeting called at the written request of stockholders, any notice submitted by a stockholder making the request must be
provided simultaneously with such request. 

Such
stockholder s notice shall include, with respect to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director,
all information relating to such person, including such person s written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee,
serving as a director, that is required under the Exchange Act. In addition, the stockholder must include in such notice their name and
address, as they appear on the Company s records and the name and address of the beneficial owner, if any, of such stockholder,
the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially or of record by such stockholder
of record and by the beneficial owner, if any, a description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder and the proposed
nominee and any other person or person (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination is to be made by such stockholder, a
representation that such stockholder intends to appear at the annual meeting to nominate the person named in its notice and any other
information required under the Exchange Act. 

Code
of Ethics and Conduct 

Our
Board has adopted a Code of Ethics and Conduct that is applicable to all our employees, officers and directors. Our Code of
Ethics and Conduct is intended to ensure that our employees act in accordance with the highest ethical standards. A copy of our Code
of Ethics and Conduct may be obtained by sending a written request to us at 15612 College Blvd., Overland Park, KS 66210; Attn: President
and the Code of Ethics and Conduct is filed as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting 

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent (10 of our common
stock, to file with the SEC reports of ownership of, and transactions in, our securities
and to provide us with copies of those filings. To our knowledge, based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by
us, or written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that during the year ended December 31, 2022, all filing requirements
applicable to our officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners were complied with during fiscal year 2022.

structure compensation for executive officers, including the named executive officers, to drive performance, to accomplish both our short-term
and long-term objectives, and to enable us to attract, retain and motivate well qualified executives by offering competitive compensation
and by rewarding superior performance. We also seek to link our executives total compensation to the interests of our shareholders.
To accomplish this, our board of directors relies on the following elements of compensation, each of which is discussed in more detail
below: 

salary; 

annual performance-based cash awards; 

equity incentives in the form of stock and/or stock options; and 

other benefits. 

Our
Board believes that our executive compensation package, consisting of these components, is comparable to the compensation provided in
the market in which we compete for executive talent and is critical to accomplishing our recruitment and retention aims. 

In
setting the amounts of each component of an executive s compensation and considering the overall compensation package, the Committee
generally considers the following factors: 

Benchmarking For
executive officers, the board of directors considers the level of compensation paid to individuals in comparable executive positions
of other oil and gas exploration and production companies of a similar size. The board of directors believes that these companies are
the most appropriate for review because they are representative of the types of companies with which we compete to recruit and retain
executive talent. The information reviewed by the board of directors includes data on salary, annual and long-term cash incentive bonuses
and equity compensation, as well as total compensation. 

Internal
Equity The board of directors considers the salary level for each executive officer and each position in overall management
in order to reflect their relative value to us. 

Individual
Performance The board of directors considers the individual responsibilities and performance of each named executive officer,
which is based in part on the board of directors assessment of that individual s performance as well as the evaluation of
the individual by the Chief Executive Officer. 

All
executive officers are eligible for annual cash bonuses and equity incentive awards that reinforce the relationship between pay and performance
by conditioning compensation on the achievement of the Company s short- and long-term financial and operating goals, including
operating profits, reserve finding costs, and growth in the Company s daily oil and gas production and estimated proved, probable
and possible recoverable oil and gas reserves. 

Components
of Executive Compensation 

The
following provides an analysis of each element of compensation, what each element is designed to reward and why the Board chose to include
it as an element of our executive compensation. 

Salaries 

Salaries
for executive officers are intended to incentivize the officers to focus on executing the Company s day-to-day business and are
reviewed annually. Changes are typically effective in April of each year and are based on the factors discussed above. Compensation arrangements
with Mr. Hutchins were determined through arms-length negotiations. The Company s Board discontinued regular cash compensation
for the Company s officers and directors effective January 1, 2018. 

54 

Annual
Bonuses 

The
awarding of annual bonuses to executives is in the discretion of the Board, in their serving the equivalent functions of the compensation
committee discretion. The objective of the annual bonus element of compensation is to align the interest of executive officers with the
achievement of superior Company performance for the year and also to encourage and reward extraordinary individual performance. In light
of the Company s operating results for 2022 and 2021, the Board determined that it was appropriate not to grant annual bonuses
to the executive officers for 2022 and 2021. 

Stock
Options 

Including
an equity component in executive compensation closely aligns the interests of the executives and our stockholders and rewards executives
consistent with stockholder gains. Stock options produce value for executives only if our stock price increases over the exercise price,
which is set at the market price on the date of grant. Also, through vesting and forfeiture provisions, stock options serve to encourage
executive officers to remain with the Company. Awards made other than pursuant to the annual equity grants are typically made to newly
hired or recently promoted employees. 

In
determining the stock option grants for Messrs. Ross, Hutchins and Loeffelbein, the Board considered the number of options previously
granted that remained outstanding, the number and value of shares underlying the options being granted and the related effect on dilution.
The Board also took into account the number of shares that remained available for grant under our stock option and restricted stock plans.
Messrs. Ross, Hutchins and Loeffelbein were granted stock options during the year ended December 31, 2021 but not 2022. Information regarding
all outstanding equity awards as of December 31, 2022 for the named executive officers is set forth below in the Outstanding Equity
Awards at Fiscal Year End table. 

Restricted
Stock Grants 

Including
an equity component in executive compensation closely aligns the interests of the executives and our stockholders and rewards executives
consistent with stockholder gains. Restricted stock grants produce value for executives as our stock price increases. The awards generally
vest over a long period of time only if they remain as employees of the Company at specified points in time. Executives generally have
to recognize taxable income based on the market price of the underlying common stock on such vesting dates. Also, through vesting and
forfeiture provisions, restricted stock grants serve to encourage executive officers to remain with the Company. Awards made other than
pursuant to the annual equity grants are typically made to newly hired or recently promoted employees. 

In
determining the restricted stock grants for Messrs. Ross and Hutchins, the Board considered the number of stock options previously
granted that remained outstanding, the number and value of restricted common shares being granted and the related effect on
dilution. The Board also took into account the number of shares that remained available for grant under our stock option and
restricted stock plans. Messrs. Ross and Hutchins were granted 500,000 and 100,000 shares of restricted Common Stock during the year
ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and none in 2021. The restricted stock grants in 2022 vest ratably at the end of the
following four calendar quarters following issuance. Information regarding all outstanding equity awards as of December 31, 2022 for
the named executive officers is set forth below in the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End table.

12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters 

The
following table sets forth, as of May 8, 2023, information regarding beneficial ownership of our capital stock by: 

each
 person, or group of affiliated persons, who is known by us to beneficially own more than 5 of our equity securities; 

each
 of our named executive officers; 

each
 of our directors; and 

all
 of our executive officers and directors as a group. 

56 

The percentage ownership information shown in the
table below is based upon 22,424,515 shares of Common Stock and 25,526 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 7,500 shares of Series B
Preferred Stock outstanding as of May 8, 2023 with shares of both Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock are subject to
the applicable 4.99 beneficial ownership limitation. On a combined basis the shareholders of both Series A Preferred Stock and Series
B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote a total of 5,694,752 votes when considering the applicable 4.99 beneficial ownership limitation.
The 22,424,515 shares of Common Stock, 25,526 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 7,500 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding
as of May 8, 2023 excludes (a) shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of up
to 33,430,783 shares of Common Stock, with a weighted average exercise price of 0.29 per share, (b) shares of Common Stock issuable upon
outstanding stock options exercisable for up to 1,442,000 shares of Common Stock, with a weighted average exercise price of 2.38 per
share, (c) 8,944,367 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of 1,266,204 principal balance of 8 Convertible Promissory Notes
outstanding, and (c) 57,330 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of 28,665 principal balance of 3 Convertible Promissory
Notes outstanding. 

Beneficial
ownership is determined according to the rules of the SEC and generally means that a person has beneficial ownership of a security if
he, she or it possesses sole or shared voting or investment power of that security, including securities that are convertible into and
exercisable for shares of Common Stock within sixty (60) days after May 8, 2023. Except as indicated by the footnotes below, we believe,
based on the information furnished to us, that the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect
to all shares of Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock shown that they beneficially own, subject to community property laws where
applicable. 

For
purposes of computing the percentage of outstanding shares of our Common Stock held by each person or group of persons named above, any
shares of Common Stock that such person or persons has the right to acquire within sixty (60) days after May 8, 2023 is deemed to
be outstanding, but is not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. The inclusion
herein of any shares of Common Stock listed as beneficially owned does not constitute an admission of beneficial ownership. 

Except
as otherwise noted below, the address for persons listed in the table is c/o American Noble Gas, Inc., 15612 College Blvd., Overland

on an as-converted basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Series A and B Preferred Stock includes beneficial ownership limitations
so that all holders of our Series A and B Preferred Stock are unable to convert their shares of Series A and B Preferred Stock to shares
of Common Stock so that they would own greater than 4.99 of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, unless they provide at
least 61 days prior written notice to increase such beneficial ownership limitation up to a maximum of 9.99 of our issued and
outstanding shares of Common Stock. These percentages reflect such beneficial ownership limitations.

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence. 

Serving

and a related party at least once a year or upon any significant change in the transaction or relationship. For these purposes, a related
party transaction includes any transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K. 

John
L. Loeffelbein, the Company s Former Chief Operating Officer from September 2019 to April 2022, is a non-controlling member of
Core Energy Resources, LLC Core ). The Company acquired an Option from Core to purchase the production and mineral rights/leasehold
for the oil and gas properties in the Central Kansas Uplift (the Properties ). The Company paid a non-refundable deposit
of 50,000 in 2019 to bind the original Option, which gave it the right to acquire the Properties for 2.5 million prior to December
31, 2019. The Company was not able to exercise the Option prior to December 31, 2019. On September 2, 2020, the Company acquired a new
Option from Core under similar terms as the previous Option, however the newly acquired Option permitted the Company to purchase the
Properties at a reduced price of 900,000 at any time prior to November 1, 2020 and the Company agreed to immediately conduct a capital
raise of between approximately 2-10 million to fund its acquisition and development of the Properties. On December 14, 2020, the parties
executed an asset purchase and sale agreement which extended the new Option to January 11, 2021, which expired. The parties entered into
a Side Letter agreement on March 31, 2021, pursuant to which we and Core agreed to set the closing date on which the Properties would
be purchased to April 1, 2021. Pursuant to the Side Letter, the Company is responsible for reimbursing Core for certain prorated revenues
and expenses from January 1, 2021 through the April 1, 2021 closing date. On April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Properties,
under the same terms of the asset purchase agreement executed on December 14, 2020 which provided a purchase price of 900,000. The Company
raised approximately 2.05 million on March 26, 2021 through the issuance of convertible preferred stock with detachable common stock
purchase warrants. The funds raised pursuant to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issuance were used to complete the acquisition
of the Properties on April 1, 2021 and to retire the outstanding convertible note payable. On April 18, 2022, Mr. Loeffelbein resigned
from his position as Chief Operating Officer, effective immediately. Mr. Loeffelbein s resignation as an officer did not result
from any disagreement with the Board.

other administrative fees. The Company no longer utilizes Hutchins Haake, LLC for such support services and was not billed for
any such services during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. On March 31, 2021 the parties entered into a Debt Settlement Agreement
whereby all amounts due to such firm for services totaling 762,407 were extinguished upon the issuance of 7,624 principal balance of
3 Convertible Promissory Note and the issuance of warrants to purchase 1,524,814 shares of Common Stock. Total amounts due to the related
