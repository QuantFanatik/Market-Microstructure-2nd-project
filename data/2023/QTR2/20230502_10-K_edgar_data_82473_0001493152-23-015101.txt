1. BUSINESS 

INTRODUCTION
TO OUR BUSINESS 

InnSuites
Hospitality Trust (the Trust is headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona and is an unincorporated Ohio real estate
investment trust formed on June 21, 1971. The Trust is not taxed as a real estate investment trust for federal taxation purposes but
is taxed as a C-corporation. The Trust, with its affiliate RRF Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (the Partnership ),
owns interests in two hotels, operates and provides management services, and provides trademark license services, for two hotels. At
January 31, 2023, and currently, the Trust owns a 75.98 sole general partner interest in the Partnership, which controls a 51.01 interest
in the InnSuites hotel located in Tucson, Arizona, and a direct 21.50 interest in the InnSuites hotel located in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
The Tucson and Albuquerque hotels are sometimes referred to as the Hotels . We anticipate selling one or both
Hotels in the next twelve to thirty-six (12-36) months. 

RRF
Limited Partnership, a 75.98 majority-owned subsidiary of the Trust, provides management services for the two Trust Hotels. The Trust
has approximately 52 full-time employees and approximately 27 part-time employees. 

The
two Hotels have an aggregate of 270 hotel suites and operate as moderate-service hotels that apply a value studio and two-room suite
operating philosophy formulated in 1980 by Mr. James Wirth, President, the Trust s Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer. The Trust
hotels offer services such as free hot breakfast plus amenities, such as microwave ovens, refrigerators, coffee makers, and free high-speed
Internet access. 

For
the Fiscal Year 2024 ahead, February 1, 2023 through January 31, 2024, the Trust s operations are focused on the Trust s
primary business objective which is to maximize returns to its shareholders through increases in asset value and long-term total returns
to shareholders, including profitable hotel operations and sale of assets, along with growth of investments. The Trust seeks to achieve
this objective through intensive management and marketing of the InnSuites hotels, by selling hotel real estate at market prices
well above book values and benefitting from diversified investments, including UniGen Power, Inc. (UniGen). See Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Future Positioning for a more detailed discussion
of the Trust s strategic objectives. 

The
Trust has a single class of Shares of Beneficial Interest, without par value, that are traded on the NYSE AMERICAN under the symbol IHT. 
The Partnership has two outstanding classes of limited partnership interests, Class A and Class B, which are identical in all respects.
Both Class A and Class B Partnership Units are convertible, at the option of the holder, into one newly issued Share of Beneficial Interest
of the Trust. 

MANAGEMENT
AND LICENSING CONTRACTS 

The
Trust directly manages the Hotels through the Trust s majority-owned subsidiary, RRF Limited Partnership. Under the management
agreements, RRF manages the daily operations of both Trust Hotels. All Trust managed Hotel expenses, revenues and reimbursements among
the Trust, and the Partnership have been eliminated in consolidation. The management fees for the Hotels are 5 of room revenue and a
monthly accounting fee of 2,000 per hotel. These agreements have no expiration dates but may be cancelled by either party with 30-days
written notice, or potentially sooner in the event the property changes ownership. 

The
Trust also provides the use of the InnSuites trademark to the Hotels and stands ready to offer trademark services through
the Trust s majority-owned subsidiary, RRF Limited Partnership, which is included in the management fee. The InnSuites trademark
expires in January 2027. 

2 

MEMBERSHIP
AGREEMENTS 

Each
InnSuites Hotel has entered into membership agreements with Best Western International, Inc. Best Western with respect to each of the two Hotels. In exchange for use of the Best Western name, trademark and reservation system, each Hotel pays
marketing and reservation fees to Best Western based on reservations received through the use of the Best Western reservation system,
a marketing fee based upon the monthly room revenues, and the number of available suites at the Hotels. The agreements with Best Western
are year-to-year. Best Western requires that the Hotels meet certain requirements for room quality, and the two Hotels are subject to
removal from the Best Western reservation system if these requirements are not met. During the past year, the two Hotels received significant
reservations through the Best Western reservation system. Under these arrangements, fees paid for membership fees and reservations were
approximately 173,000 and 160,000, recorded in on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, for Fiscal Years ended January 31, 2023,
and 2022, respectively. 

COMPETITION
IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY 

The
hotel industry is highly competitive. Both the Tucson and Albuquerque hotels experienced record high GOP Profits in the most recent 12
months, substantially higher than both Covid and Pre-Covid GOP Profits. This gross operating profit is growing even more due to stringent
cost control measures. The drastic impact of COVID-19 to the world economy and hospitality industry resulted in severely reduced occupancy
and significant reduction in room rates, both of which have now fully recovered. Continued competition in corporate, leisure, group,
and government business in the markets in which we operate, may affect our ability to maintain room rates and maintain market share.
Each of the Hotels faces competition primarily from other mid-market hotels located in its immediate vicinity, but also competes with
hotel properties located in other geographic markets, and increasingly from alternative lodging facilities, such as Airbnb. While none
of the Hotels competitors dominate any of their geographic markets, some of those competitors may have greater marketing and financial
resources than the Trust. 

Certain
additional hotel property refurbishments have been completed by competitors in both Hotels markets, and additional hotel property
developments may be built in the future. Such hotel developments could have an adverse effect on the revenue of our Hotels in their respective
markets. 

The
Trust s hotel investments are located in Arizona and New Mexico. With the completed renovations meeting Best Western standards
at our Tucson, Arizona and Albuquerque, New Mexico hotel properties, those hotels are expected to see incremental demand during the next
24 months, as supply had been steady in those respective markets, and demand is expected to increase as the economy and travel industry
grow. Either an increase in supply, or a decline in demand could result in increased competition, which could have an adverse effect
on occupancy, room rates and revenues of our Hotels in their respective markets. The hotels experienced a decrease in demand due to impact
of the COVID-19 virus and the related restrictions and reduction of travel after February 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, with increased
demand thereafter. 

The
Trust may not invest further in hotels, but rather diversify into investments such as the investment made by the Trust in December 2019
in the innovative UniGen Power, Inc. (UniGen), efficient clean energy power generation company. This investment is expected to expand
over the next 36 months, as the Trust exercises warrants and convertible bonds into UniGen equity. The Trust may continue to seek further
diversification through a reverse merger with a larger non-public entity. 

REGULATION 

The
Trust is subject to numerous federal, state, and local government laws and regulations affecting the hospitality industry, including
usage, building and zoning requirements and the laws and regulations related to the preparation and sale of food and beverage such as
health and liquor license laws. A violation of any of those laws and regulations or increased government regulation could require the
Trust to make unplanned expenditures which may result in higher operating costs. Compliance with these laws is time intensive and costly
and may reduce the Trust s revenues and operating income. 

3 

Under
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the ADA ), all public accommodations are required to meet certain
readily achievable federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. In addition to ADA work completed to date, the
Trust may be required to remove additional access barriers or make unplanned, substantial modifications to its Hotels to further comply
with the ADA or to comply with other changes in governmental rules and regulations, or become subject to claims, fines, and damage awards,
any of which could reduce the number of total available rooms, increase operating costs, and/or have a negative impact on the Trust s
results of operations. 

Our
hotel properties are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws that impose liability for contamination. Under these
laws, governmental entities have the authority to require us, as the current or former owner of the property, to perform or pay for the
clean-up of contamination (including swimming pool chemicals or hazardous substances or biological waste) at or arising from the property
and to pay for natural resource damage arising from contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner
or operator knew of or caused the contamination. Such liability can be joint and several, so that each covered person can be responsible
for all the costs involved, even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination. We can also be liable to private
parties for costs of remediation, personal injury, death and/or property damage resulting from contamination at or originating from our
hotel properties. Moreover, environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and, therefore, an owner s ability to
borrow funds using the property as collateral or to sell the property on favorable terms or at all. Furthermore, persons who sent waste
to a waste disposal facility, such as a landfill or an incinerator, may be liable for costs associated with cleanup of that facility. 

The
Trust is also subject to laws governing our relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions
and work permit requirements. There are frequent proposals under consideration, at the federal and state levels, to increase the minimum
wage. The current labor market is tight, with employees increasingly difficult to recruit and retain. Additional increases to the state
or federal minimum wage rate, and employee benefit costs including health care or other costs associated with employees could increase
expenses and result in lower operating margins. This has been experienced somewhat due to the fact that industry labor is currently limited
and increasingly expensive. 

The
Trust collects and maintains information relating to its guests for various business purposes, including maintaining guest preferences
to enhance the Trust s customer service and for marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data are
governed by privacy laws and regulations. Compliance with applicable privacy regulations may further increase the Trust s operating
costs and/or adversely impact its ability to service its guests and market its products, properties, and services to its guests. In addition,
non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by the Trust (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by
the Trust) could result in fines or restrictions on its use or transfer of data. 

SEASONALITY
OF THE HOTEL BUSINESS 

The
Hotels operations historically have been somewhat seasonal. The Tucson, Arizona Hotel typically experiences its highest occupancy
in the first Fiscal quarter and, to a lesser extent, the fourth Fiscal quarter (the winter high season). The second Fiscal quarter (summer),
tends to be the lowest occupancy period at the Tucson Hotel. The hotel located in Albuquerque, New Mexico historically experiences their
most profitable periods during the second and third Fiscal quarters (the summer high season), providing balance to the general seasonality
of the Trust s hotel business. 

The
seasonal nature of the Trust s business increases its vulnerability to risks such as labor force shortages and cash flow issues.
Further, if an adverse event such as an actual or threatened terrorist attack, viral outbreak or pandemic, international conflict, data
breach, regional economic downturn or poor weather conditions should occur during the high season, the adverse impact to the Trust s
revenues could likely be greater as a result of its seasonal business.

7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

GENERAL 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in
this Form 10-K. 

We
are engaged in the ownership and operation of hotel properties. At January 31, 2023, the Trust had two moderate-service hotels, one in
Tucson, Arizona and one in Albuquerque, New Mexico with 270 hotel suites. Both of our Trust Hotels are branded through membership agreements
with Best Western, and both are also trademarked as InnSuites Hotels and Suites. We are also involved in various operations incidental
to the operation of hotels, such as the operation of a limited service restaurant, and bar, as well as meeting/banquet room rentals. 

At
January 31, 2023, and currently, the Trust owns a 75.98 sole general partner interest in the Partnership, which controls a 51.01 interest
in the InnSuites hotel located in Tucson, Arizona, and a direct 21.50 interest in the InnSuites hotel located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

Our
operations consist of one reportable segment Hotel Operations Hotel Management Services. Hotel Operations derives its revenue
from the operation of the Trust s two hotel properties with an aggregate of 270 suites in Arizona and New Mexico. Hotel management
services, provides management services for the Trust s two Hotels. As part of our management services, we also provide trademark
and licensing services. 

The
Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM ), Mr. Wirth, CEO of the Trust, has determined that the Trust operations are comprised
of one reportable segment, Hotel Ownership Operations Management Services (continuing operations) segment that has ownership interest
in two hotel properties with an aggregate of 270 suites in Arizona and New Mexico. 

The
Trust has its hotel investments in the southwest region of the United States. The CODM does not review assets by geographical region;
therefore, no income statement or balance sheet information by geographical region is provided. 

Our
results are significantly affected by the overall economy and travel, occupancy and room rates at the Hotels, our ability to manage costs,
changes in room rates, and changes in the number of available suites caused by the Trust s disposition activities. Results are
also significantly impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry. Unfavorable changes in these factors,
such as the virus-related travel slowdown in the Fiscal Year starting February 1, 2020, can and have negatively impacted hotel room demand
and pricing, which reduces our profit margins. Additionally, our ability to manage costs could be adversely impacted by significant increases
in operating expenses, resulting in lower operating margins, and higher hourly labor costs. Either a further increase in area hotel supply,
hourly labor cost, or a decline in demand could result in increased competition, which could have an adverse effect on the rates, revenue,
costs, and profits of the Hotels in their respective markets. 

Over
time, we expect our UniGen diversification efficient clean energy generation investment to grow and provide a substantial source of income
in the foreseeable future. 

We
expect the current Fiscal Year 2024 to be continued recovery of the travel industry, continued recovery of our Hotel s occupancy
levels, continued recovery of room rates, as well as continuation of current cost control all leading to improved profitability of our
hotels. We believe that we have positioned the Hotels to remain competitive through our now fully completed Tucson and Albuquerque hotel
refurbishments, by offering fully refurbished studios and two-room suites at each location, and by maintaining complementary guest items,
including complimentary breakfast and free Internet access. 

Our
strategic plan is to continue to obtain the full benefit of our real estate equity, by ultimately obtaining full market value for our
two Hotels at market value which is believed by management to be substantially higher than lower book values, over the next 24-36 months.
In addition, the Trust is seeking a larger private reverse merger partner that may benefit from a merger that would afford that partner
access to our listing on the NYSE AMERICAN. 

In
the process of reviewing merger opportunities, the Trust identified in December 2019, and invested 1 million in UniGen Power, Inc. UniGen ),
an innovative efficient clean energy power generation company. The Trust has invested 1 million in debentures convertible into 1 million
shares of UniGen Power Inc., and in addition has acquired warrants to purchase approximately an additional 2 million UniGen shares over
the next approximately three years, which could result up to 25 ownership in UniGen. For more information on our strategic plan, including
information on our progress in disposing of our hotel properties and expanding energy diversification, see Future Positioning 
in this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

We
experienced weak economic conditions during Fiscal Year 2022, ended January 31, 2022, primarily a result of the Covid-19 virus pandemic.
We experienced recovery from weak travel and hospitality industry for much of the current Fiscal Year 2023, ending January 31, 2023 due
to the recovery of domestic travel. We expect the major challenge for Fiscal Year 2024 to be the economy, continued recovery of the travel
industry, rebound of occupancy levels, continued increases in room rates, and cost control. We believe that we have positioned the Hotels
to remain competitive through our now completed refurbishment(s), by offering a relatively large number of fully refurbished two-room
suites at each location, and by maintaining robust complementary guest items, including complimentary breakfast and free Internet access. 

7 

Our
strategic plan is to continue to obtain the full benefit from hotel operations, and from our real estate equity, by marketing the remaining
two Hotels over the next 12-36 months. In addition, the Trust is seeking a larger private reverse merger partner that may benefit from
a merger that would afford that partner access to our listing on the NYSE AMERICAN. In the process of reviewing merger opportunities,
the Trust identified and invested 1 million in UniGen Power, Inc. UniGen ), an innovative efficient clean energy power
generation company. The Trust has invested 1 million debentures convertible into 1 million shares of UniGen Power Inc., has purchased
approximately 495,000 UniGen shares, and in addition has acquired warrants to purchase approximately an additional 2 million UniGen shares
over the next three years, which could result up to 25 ownership in UniGen. For more information on our strategic plan, including information
on our progress in disposing of our hotel properties and expanding energy diversification, see Future Positioning in this
Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Our expenses consist primarily of property taxes,
insurance, corporate overhead, interest on mortgage debt, professional fees, non-cash depreciation of the Hotels and hotel operating expenses.
Hotel operating expenses consist primarily of payroll, guest and maintenance supplies, marketing, and utilities expenses. Management believes
that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the Hotels, particularly with respect to occupancy, which is calculated
as rooms sold divided by total rooms available, average daily rate ADR ), calculated as total room revenue
divided by number of rooms sold, and revenue per available room REVPAR ), calculated as total room revenue
divided by number of rooms available, is appropriate for understanding revenue from the Hotels. In Fiscal Year 2023, as compared with
Fiscal 2022, occupancy decreased approximately 2.17 to 73.96 from 75.60 in the prior Fiscal Year. ADR increased by 12.32, or 14.78 ,
to 95.66 in Fiscal Year 2023 from 83.34 in Fiscal Year 2022. The increased ADR resulted in an increase in REVPAR of 7.75, or 12.30 ,
to 70.75 in Fiscal Year 2023 from 63.00 in Fiscal Year 2022. The increase in ADR and REVPAR reflect the Covid-19 travel lockdown easing
and resulting improved economy. 

For
the Fiscal Year 2023, ending January 31, 2023, we experienced a substantial recovery. For Fiscal 2024, (February 1, 2023 to January 31,
2024), we expect continued modest increase in occupancy, substantial further increases in rates, and continued increased record profits
and revenues compared to both prior levels. 

For
the 2022 Fiscal Year (February 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022), which was adversely affected by the Covid pandemic, InnSuites and the entire
hotel industry in general experienced strong declines and reduced travel, resulting in much lower revenues and profits. For the 2023
Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2023, InnSuites experienced substantial recovery of post Covid revenues and profits. Fiscal Year 2023,
ended January 31, 2023 continued this upward trend achieving record profits.

REVENUE 

For the twelve months ended January 31, 2023, we had
total revenue of approximately 7,146,000 compared to approximately 6,410,000 for the twelve months ended January 31, 2022, an increase
of approximately 736,000, or 53 . 

We realized a 12 increase in room revenues during
Fiscal Year 2023 as room revenues were approximately 6,974,000 for the Fiscal Year ending January 31, 2023 as compared to approximately
 6,208,000 for the Fiscal Year ending January 31, 2022. While room revenue increased, our food and beverage revenue remained flat for
Fiscal Year 2023 at approximately 53,000 during Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022. We also realized an approximate 82 decrease in management
and trademark fee revenues during Fiscal Year 2022 to approximately 21,000 as compared to approximately 115,000 during Fiscal Year 2021.
Management and trademark fee revenues decreased during Fiscal Year 2021 as a result of the loss of management fees due to the sale of
the Tempe hotel in December, 2020. The Tempe hotel was owned outside of the Trust, and only an affiliate. It was not part of the Trust
consolidation. Management fees associated with the management of the Tempe Hotel were revenues received by the Trust, prior to its sale.
Management fees remained unchanged year on year at 5 .

EXPENSES 

Total expenses before interest expense, employee retention
credit, sales and occupancy taxes and income tax provision were approximately 7,443,000 for the twelve months ended January 31, 2023
reflecting an increase of approximately 730,000 compared to total expenses before interest expense, employee retention credit, sales
and occupancy taxes and income tax provision of approximately 6,713,000 for the twelve months ended January 31, 2022. The increase was
primarily due to an increase in room expenses and general and admirative expenses. Specific expense comparisons to the prior Fiscal Year
are detailed in the following categories. 

Room expenses consisting of salaries and related employment
taxes for property management, front office, housekeeping personnel, reservation fees and room supplies were approximately 2,222,000
for the Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2023 compared to approximately 2,011,000 in the prior year period for an increase of approximately
 211,000, or 11 . Room expenses increased as occupancy at the hotels increased, and increased expenses were incurred with the increased
occupancy. 

General and administrative expenses include overhead
charges for management, accounting, shareholder, and legal services. General and administrative expenses of approximately 2,227,000 for
the twelve months ended January 31, 2023, increased approximately 395,000 from approximately 1,832,000 for the twelve months ended January
31, 2022 primarily due to increases in minimum wage laws affecting a majority of our employees, creating higher personnel costs along
with increased employment taxes, accordingly. 

Sales and marketing expense increased approximately
 52,000, or 13 , to approximately 451,000 for the twelve months ended January 31, 2023 from approximately 399,000 for the twelve months
ended January 31, 2022. Filled positions for sales and marketing resources accounted for the increase. 

Repairs and maintenance expense increased by approximately
 20,000, or 5 , to approximately 413,000 for the twelve months ended January 31, 2023 from approximately 392,000 for the twelve months
ended January 31, 2022. Having completed the property improvements at our Tucson, Arizona hotel Management anticipates the improvements
which complies with the increasing Best Western standards, will (after the adverse effects of travel restrictions and slowdown), lead
to improvement in guest satisfaction and will drive additional revenue growth through increased occupancy and increased rates in the year
ahead. 

Hospitality expense increased by approximately 135,000,
or 58 , to approximately 368,000 for the twelve months ended January 31, 2023 from approximately 233,000 for the twelve months ended
January 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the increased occupancy and increased breakfast offerings at the hotel properties
due to previous pandemic restrictions no longer in effect. 

Utility expenses increased approximately 45,000,
or 12 , to approximately 428,000 reported for the twelve months ended January 31, 2023 from approximately 383,000 for the twelve months
ended January 31, 2022. 

Hotel property depreciation expenses decreased by
approximately 23,000 to approximately 702,000 for the twelve months ended January 31, 2023 from approximately 725,000 for the twelve
months ended January 31, 2022. Decreased depreciation resulted from the capital expenditures being fully depreciated, and thus less expense
was incurred and recorded. 

Real estate and personal property taxes, Insurance
and Ground Rent expenses decreased approximately 72,000, or 14 , to approximately 429,000 for the twelve months ended January 31, 2023
from approximately 501,000 for the twelve months ended January 31, 2022. 

10 

Sales and occupancy tax expenses increased approximately
 798,000, or 100 , to 0 for the twelve months ended January 31, 2023 from approximately 798,000) for the twelve months ended January
31, 2022. The 2022 activity represents a reversal of liability arising from an occupancy tax discrepancy generated from our Tucson Oracle
and Albuquerque hotels from prior periods, as the liabilities had been assumed by a related party. These additional amounts were due for
Hotel sales and occupancy expenses and are not expected to be recurring, since the Trust collects and remits all necessary occupancy taxes
to the state monthly. No additional assessments have transpired since September 2020. Management has assessed the materiality of the discrepancy
on prior reported periods and has concluded it is qualitatively immaterial to the readers of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Employment Tax Refunds and Credits, for the two previously
filed calendar years 2020, and 2021, respectively, resulted in the Employment Retention Tax Credit. As a result, the Trust conservatively
placed an amount equal to approximately 12 of this total as a Tax Credit Receivable and Tax Refund on the Balance Sheet and Income statement,
respectively, for the Fiscal Years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Trust has further conservatively recognized an additional
12 each Fiscal Quarter, approximately, of the total anticipated Tax Credit receivable for the Quarter ended January 31, 2023. This recognition
began in Fiscal Year 2022. The amount recognized increased from approximately 350,000 for the twelve months ended January 31, 2022 to
approximately 1,400,000 for the twelve months ended January 31, 2023. This increase was a result of recognizing equal amounts quarterly
of approximately 350,000 throughout Fiscal Year 2023, as opposed to only one Quarter of recognition in Fiscal Year 2022. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Overview
 Hotel Operations Hotel Management Services 

Two
principal sources of cash to meet our cash requirements, include monthly management fees from our two hotels and distributions to our
investors of our share of the Partnership s cash flow of the Tucson hotel, and quarterly distributions from the Albuquerque, New
Mexico properties. Potential future real estate hotel sales is another future source of cash. The Partnership s principal source
of revenue is hotel operations for the hotel property it owns in Tucson, Arizona. Our liquidity, including our ability to make distributions
to our shareholders, will depend upon our ability, and the Partnership s ability, to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations,
from management fees, and from the potential sale and/or refinance of the hotel, and to service our debt and the source of repayment
of intercompany loan from Tucson and Albuquerque. 

Hotel
operations were significantly affected by occupancy and room rates at the Hotels in the Fiscal Year 2022. We anticipate occupancy will
continue to climb modestly in Fiscal 2023, while room rates continue to climb aggressively in Fiscal 2023, and the related economic and
travel rebound which started in Fiscal 2022 will continue in Fiscal 2023 (February 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023). Capital improvements
are expected to remain substantially down in Fiscal 2023, based on the extensive prior refurbishments completed in Fiscal 2021. 

With
approximately 2,111,000 of cash as of January 31, 2023 and the availability of a 250,000 bank lines of credit, an up to 2,000,000
related party Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note, and the availability of repayment of Advances to Affiliate credit facilities
and available Bank line of Credit, we believe that we will have enough cash on hand to meet all of our financial obligations as they
become due for at least the next twelve months from the issuance date of the these consolidated financial statements. In addition, our
management is analyzing other strategic options, including additional asset sales. However, such transactions may not be available on
terms that are favorable to us, or at all. 

IHT
and InnDependent Boutique Collections Hotels (IBC), agreed to extend the payment schedule on IBC s note receivable by 18 months,
extending the first payment from November 2021 to May 2023. The reason for the extension is in support of IBC s cash requirements;
related to IBC s realization of fully benefiting from a travel industry continued rebound of rate, occupancy and travel. These
potential benefits in turn improve IHT s secured position on its note receivable from IBC. Management also believes that even with
an additional extension repayment term due to COVID-19 that the future collectability of the current carrying value of the note is probable
and not subject to further impairment, or allowance for the year ended January 31, 2023. 

Refer
to Note 6 Note Receivable for information related to the Sale of IBC Hospitality Technologies (IBC). 

There
can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional or replacement funds, or that these funds may be available on terms
that are favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional or replacement funds, we may be required to refinance or sell certain
of our assets to meet our liquidity needs, which may not be on terms that are favorable. 

11 

We
anticipate no material additional competitive new-build hotel supply during the remaining Fiscal Year 2024, and accordingly we anticipate
steady hotel supply in our markets and increased travel demand as the industry rebounds with recovery of revenues and operating margins.
We expect the challenge for the upcoming current Fiscal Year to be the continued economic and travel recovery of leisure, corporate,
group, and government business in the markets in which we operate, which may affect our ability to recover occupancy and increase room
rates while maintaining and/or building market share. 

Positive cash provided by operating activities totaled
approximately 54,000 during the twelve months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to net cash provided of approximately 263,000 during
the twelve months ended January 31, 2022. Consolidated net income was approximately 737,000 for the twelve months ended January 31, 2023
as compared to consolidated net income for the twelve months ended January 31, 2022 of approximately 1,540,000. A decrease in each Fiscal
Year was PPP loan forgiveness offset by and the employee retention credit. Explanation of the differences between these Fiscal Years are
explained above in the results of operations of the Trust. 

On November 15, 2021, the Trust received a letter
from the NYSE American indicating it did not meet certain financial requirements to remain listed, and set a timeframe of 18 months to
May 2023, to once again meet those standards of earnings, capitalization, and/or profitability. The Trust provided the required Plan by
December 15, 2021, and the NYSE American granted the additional 18 months to execute the Plan. 

On April 30, 2022, the Trust requested and was granted
an extension for their annual Form 10-K. As a result, the NT 10-K filed (Form 12b-25 Filing Extension), granted a fifteen-day extension
for the Trust to file its annual Form 10-K. Subsequently, the Trust completed and filed its annual 10-K and corresponding
press release on May 25, 2022, and is considered to be in compliance currently. 

On
June 23, 2022, the Trust received communication from the NYSE AMERICAN indicating a Late-Filer Notification would be issued, provided
it s current quarterly 10-Q for the period ended April 30, 2022 would be considered delinquent if not filed on or before June 29,
2022. The Trust is now current and compliant, and was able to complete their 10-Q for the period ended April 30, 2022, filing it on June
28, 2022, thus avoiding any delinquency status and adhering to this timeline. 

The
Trust s Management received communication from the NYSE-American on August 29, 2022, indicating IHT is fully compliant with all
of the Continued Listing Standards Equity Requirements set forth in Part 10 of the NYSE American Company Guide, of the NYSE-American. 

NON-GAAP
FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The
following non-GAAP presentations of earnings before interest, taxes, non-cash depreciation, and amortization EBITDA and funds from operations FFO are made to assist our investors in evaluating our operating performance. 

Adjusted
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense, amortization of loan costs, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization,
and non-controlling interests in the Trust. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe these measurements (a) more accurately reflect
the ongoing performance of our hotel assets and other investments, (b) provide more useful information to investors as indicators of
our ability to meet our future debt payments and working capital requirements, and (c) provide an overall evaluation of our financial
condition. Adjusted EBITDA as calculated by us may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA reported by other companies that do not define
Adjusted EBITDA exactly as we define the term. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined
in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to (a) GAAP net income or loss as an indication of our financial
performance or (b) GAAP cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.

FFO
is calculated on the basis defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ),
which is net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses on sales
of properties, asset impairment adjustments, and extraordinary items as defined by GAAP, plus non-cash depreciation and amortization
of real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures and non-controlling interests in the operating partnership.
NAREIT developed FFO as a relative measure of performance of an equity REIT to recognize that income-producing real estate historically
has not depreciated on the basis determined by GAAP. The Trust is an unincorporated Ohio business investment, (real estate investment
trust); however, the Trust is not a real estate investment trust for federal taxation purposes. Management uses this measurement to compare
itself to REITs with similar depreciable assets. We consider FFO to be an appropriate measure of our ongoing normalized operating performance.
We compute FFO in accordance with our interpretation of standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported
by other companies that either do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or interpret the NAREIT definition
differently than us. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by GAAP and should not be considered
as an alternative to (a) GAAP net income or loss as an indication of our financial performance or (b) GAAP cash flows from operating
activities as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs, including our ability to
make cash distributions. However, to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results, we believe that FFO should
be considered along with our net income or loss and cash flows reported in the consolidated financial statements.

The Trust reported Consolidated Net Loss from operations

 304,000 for the Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2022. Fiscal 2022 and 2021 Consolidated Net Loss from operations included non-cash depreciation
of approximately 702,000 and 725,000, respectively. Fiscal 2023 Consolidated Net Loss from operations before non-cash depreciation was
approximately 404,000 as compared to Consolidated Net Loss from operations before non-cash depreciation of approximately 421,000 for
Fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2023 Consolidated Net Loss from continuing operations were approximately 7,146,000 as compared with Fiscal 2022 Revenues
of approximately 6,410,000.

FUTURE
POSITIONING 

In
viewing the hotel industry cycles, recently reconfirmed by the COVID-19 disruption of travel and hospitality, the Board of Trustees determined
that it was appropriate to continue to actively seek buyers for our two remaining Hotel properties. We continue to make our Tucson Hotel
and Albuquerque Hotel available for sale at market value, on the website www.suitehotelsrealty.com. 

The
table below provides book values, mortgage balances and Estimated Market Asking Price for the Hotels.

7,186,600 
 9,528,470 
 28,000,000 

The
 Estimated Market Asking Price is the amount at which we believe may sell each of the Hotels and is adjusted to reflect
hotel sales in the Hotels areas of operation and projected upcoming 12 month earnings of each of the Hotels. The Estimated Market
Asking Price is not based on appraisals of the properties. 

We
have from time to time listed hotel properties with a long time highly successful local real estate hotel broker who has successfully
sold four of our hotel properties. We believe that each of the assets have an estimated market asking price that is reasonable in relation
to its current fair market value. We plan to sell our remaining two Hotel properties within 24-36 months. We can provide no assurance
that we will be able to sell either or both of the Hotel properties on terms favorable to us or within our expected time frame, or at
all. 

Although
believed feasible, we may be unable to realize the asking price for the individual Hotel properties or to sell and/or refinance one or
both. However, we believe that the asking price values are reasonable based on upturn local market conditions, comparable sales, and
anticipated continued upturns in occupancy, rates, and profits per hotel. Changes in market conditions have in part resulted, and may
in the future result, in our changing one or all of the asking prices. 

Our
long-term strategic plan is to obtain the full benefit of our real estate equity, to benefit from our UniGen Power, Inc., (UniGen) clean
energy operation diversified investment, and to pursue a merger with another company, likely a private larger entity that seeks to go
public to list on the NYSE AMERICAN Exchange. 

SHARE
REPURCHASE PROGRAM 

For
information on the Trust s Share Repurchase Program, see Part II, Item 5. Market for the Registrant s Common Equity,
Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. We plan to continue the stock and unit buy backs in the
current Fiscal Year 2023. 

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities. We do not have any majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries
that are not included in our consolidated financial statements. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

As
a partial offset to the current hotel industry Virus induced drop in demand pressure, the Trust looks to benefit from, and expand, its
UniGen clean energy operation diversification investments in the months, and years ahead. See Note 7 of the Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements for discussion on UniGen. 

Asset
Impairment 

We
believe that the policies we follow for the valuation of our hotel properties, which constitute the majority of our assets, are our most
critical policies. The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB has issued authoritative guidance related to the impairment
or disposal of long-lived assets, codified in ASC Topic 360-10-35, which we apply to determine when it is necessary to test an asset
for recoverability. On an events and circumstances basis, we review the carrying value of our hotel properties. We will record an impairment
loss and reduce the carrying value of a property when anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and the current market value of the
property do not support its carrying value. In cases where we do not expect to recover the carrying cost of hotel properties held for
use, we will reduce the carrying value to the fair value of the hotel, as determined by a current appraisal or other acceptable valuation
methods. We did not recognize a hotel properties impairment loss in Fiscal Years 2022 or 2021. As of January 31, 2023, our management
does not believe that the carrying values of any of our hotel properties are impaired. The Trust did take a reserve for bad debt as of
January 31, 2022 reflecting its concern with the collectability of the Obasa note receivable, related to the sale of the IBC technology
segment.

Management
believes that our currently owned Hotels are valued at prices that are reasonable in relation to their current fair market value. At
this time, the Trust is unable to predict when, and if, either of its Hotel properties will be sold. The Trust seeks to sell one hotel
per year or both over the next 12-36 months. We believe that each of the assets is available at a price that is reasonable in relation
to its current fair market value. The plan is to work to sell the remaining two hotel properties over the next 12-36 months, and if needed
beyond. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Revenues
are primarily derived from the following sources and are recognized as services are rendered and when collectability is reasonably assured.
Amounts received in advance of revenue recognition are considered deferred liabilities. 

Revenues
primarily consist of room rentals, food and beverage sales, management and trademark fees and other miscellaneous revenues from our properties.
Revenues are recorded when rooms are occupied and when food and beverage sales are delivered. Management and trademark fees from non-affiliated
hotels include a monthly accounting fee and a percentage of hotel room revenues for managing the daily operations of the Hotels and the
one hotel owned by affiliates of Mr. Wirth until December 2020. 

Each
room night consumed by a guest with a cancellable reservation represents a contract whereby the Trust has a performance obligation to
provide the room night at an agreed upon price. For cancellable reservations, the Trust recognizes revenue as each performance obligation
(i.e., each room night) is met. Such contract is renewed if the guest continues their stay. For room nights consumed by a guest with
a non-cancellable reservation, the entire reservation period represents the contract term whereby the Trust has a performance obligation
to provide the room night or nights at an agreed upon price. For non-cancellable reservations, the Trust recognizes revenue over the
term of the performance period (i.e., the reservation period) as room nights are consumed. For these reservations, the room rate is typically
fixed over the reservation period. The Trust uses an output method based on performance completed to date (i.e., room nights consumed)
to determine the amount of revenue it recognizes on a daily basis if the length of a non-cancellable reservation exceeds one night since
consumption of room nights indicates when services are transferred to the guest. In certain instances, variable consideration may exist
with respect to the transaction price, such as discounts, coupons and price concessions made upon guest checkout. 

In
evaluating its performance obligation, the Trust bundles the obligation to provide the guest the room itself with other obligations (such
as free Wi-Fi, grab and go breakfast, access to on-site laundry facilities and parking), as the other obligations are not distinct and
separable because the guest cannot benefit from the additional amenities without the consumed room night. The Trust s obligation
to provide the additional items or services is not separately identifiable from the fundamental contractual obligation (i.e., providing
the room and its contents). The Trust has no performance obligations once a guest s stay is complete. 

We
are required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit these back to the applicable
governmental agencies on a periodic basis. We have a legal obligation to act as a collection agent. We do not retain these taxes and
fees and, therefore, they are not included in revenues. We record a liability when the amounts are collected and relieve the liability
when payments are made to the applicable taxing authority or other appropriate governmental agency. 

SEASONALITY 

See
Item 1 for related discussion of seasonality. 

15 

INFLATION 

We
rely entirely on the performance of the Hotels and InnSuites ability to increase revenue to keep pace with inflation. Operators of hotels
in general, and InnSuites in particular, can change room rates quickly, but competitive pressures may limit InnSuites ability to raise
rates as fast as or faster than inflation. During Fiscal Year 2023, ended January 31, 2023, InnSuites did experience substantial increases
in rates to offset the inflationary increase labor and other expenses. 

INVESTMENT
IN UNIGEN POWER, INC. 

On
December 16, 2019, the Trust entered into a Convertible Debenture Purchase Agreement with UniGen Power Inc. UniGen ). InnSuites
Hospitality Trust (IHT) made an initial 1 million diversification investment in late Fiscal Year 2020 and early Fiscal Year 2021. UniGen
is in the process of developing a patented high profit potential new efficient clean energy generation innovation. The initial investment
was made December 16, 2019, with positive progress to date despite the virus, economic, travel disruptions, cost overruns, and delays.
The investment includes warrants convertible to UniGen stock upon election of the Trust. The investment is valued at fair value (level
3), as defined in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. There is no Investment Commitment to UniGen requiring any restriction
of cash. 

The
Trust purchased secured convertible debentures Debentures in the aggregate amount of 1,000,000 (the Loan Amount (the Loan at an annual interest rate of 6 (approximately 15,000 per quarter). The Debentures are convertible into 1,000,000
Class A shares of UniGen Common Stock at an initial conversion rate of 1.00 per share. 

UniGen
issued the Trust common stock purchase warrants (the Debenture Warrants including to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of
Class A Common Stock. The Debenture Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of 1.00 per share of Class A Common Stock. 

UniGen,
also, issued the Trust additional common stock purchase warrants Additional Warrants to purchase up to 500,000 shares
of Class A Common Stock. The Additional Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of 2.25 per share of Class A Common Stock. 

UniGen
has agreed to allow IHT to fund a 500,000 line of credit at the option of IHT convertible into 500,000 shares of UniGen stock at 1
per share. Currently, there is no outstanding balance at this time. 

The
total of all stock ownership upon conversion of the note receivable and exercise of warrants could total up to 3 million UniGen shares,
which amounts to approximately 25 of fully diluted UniGen equity. 

On
the Trust s balance sheet, the investment of the 1,588,750 consists of approximately 700,000 in note receivables, approximately
 300,000 as the fair value of the warrants issued with the Trust s investment in UniGen, and 588,750 of UniGen Common Stock (495,000
shares), at cost. The value of the premium related to the fair value of the warrant will accrete over the life of the debentures. 

16 

UniGen has confirmed that prototype design engineering
for the UPI 1000 NG engine is now complete. Parts and tooling have arrived, and continue to arrive weekly. 

Engineering work is on hold, while UniGen concentrates
on its next round of capital raising. 

UniGen is a high risk investment offering high potential
investment return when successful. 

Based on a 96 core super computer simulated
test together with advanced software, UniGen has confirmed that the UPI 1000 NG engine with the addition of recent technological advancements,
is approximately 33 more fuel efficient than first estimated and will emit only approximately 25 of the maximum admissions allowed by
CARB, the strictest of the regulatory standards issued by the state of California. 

The UniGen design is to produce generators fueled
not only with relatively clean natural gas but also with other even cleaner fuels such as ethanol and hydrogen (that emits only water). 

James Wirth (IHT President) and Marc Berg (IHT Executive
Vice President) both lack significant UniGen control. They have two of the six UniGen Board of Directors seats or 33 and were elected
in December 2019 to serve on the board of UniGen to closely monitor and assist in the success of this potentially power industry disruptive
relatively clean energy generation innovation. 

The Trust has valued UniGen investment as a level
3 fair value measurement, for the following reasons: The investment does not qualify for level 1 since there are no identical actively
traded instruments or level 2 identical or similar unobservable markets.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of InnSuites Hospitality Trust : 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of InnSuites Hospitality Trust (the Company as of January 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements
of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the two years in the period ended January 31, 2023, and the related notes
and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the two years in the period ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 

We
determined that there are no critical audit matters.

Hotel
Operations: 

Full
service hotels often contain upscale full-service facilities with a large volume of full service accommodations, on-site full-service
restaurant(s), and a variety of on-site amenities such as swimming pools, a health club, children s activities, ballrooms and on-site
conference facilities. Moderate or limited-service hotels are small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer a limited amount
of on-site amenities. Most moderate or limited service establishments may still offer full service accommodations. The Trust considers
its Tucson, Arizona hotel and our hotel located in a subsidiary of Albuquerque, New Mexico to be moderate or limited service hotels.
IHT provides management services and marketing. 

Our
Tucson, Arizona Hotel and our Hotel located in Albuquerque, New Mexico are moderate service hotels. Both hotels offer swimming pools,
fitness centers, business centers, and complimentary breakfast. In addition, the Hotels offer complementary social areas and modest conference
facilities. The Tucson hotel has PJ s Pub and Caf , as well. 

The
Trust is the sole general partner of RRF Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (the Partnership ), and owned
a interest in the Partnership as of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, respectively. The Trust s weighted average ownership
for the twelve months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was and , respectively. As of January 31, 2023, the Partnership owned
a interest in an InnSuites hotel located in Tucson, Arizona. The Trust owns a direct interest in an InnSuites hotel
located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

RRF
Limited Partnership, a subsidiary, manages the Hotels daily operations under 2 management agreements. RRF also provides the use
of the InnSuites trademark to the Hotels. All expenses and reimbursements between the Trust and RRF Partnership have been
eliminated in consolidation. 

The
Trust classified the Hotels as operating assets, but these assets are available for sale. At this time, the Trust is unable to predict
when, and if, either of these will be sold. Neither the Tucson Hotel nor the Albuquerque Hotel is currently listed for sale but the Trust
is willing to consider offers for each Hotel. Each of the Hotels is being made available at a price that management believes is reasonable
in relation to its current fair market value, earnings, profits, and replacement cost.

The
Trust has evaluated subsequent events through the date of the filing of its Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other
than those events disclosed indicating the recovery of economic and business activity, and continuing progress by UniGen in developing
its innovative clean energy product, the Trust is not aware of any other significant events that occurred subsequent to the balance sheet
date but prior to the filing of this report that would have a material impact on the Trust s financial statements.

NON-CONTROLLING
INTEREST 

Non-controlling
interest in the Trust represents the limited partners proportionate share of the capital and earnings of the Partnership and the
two hotels. Income or loss is allocated to the non-controlling interest based on a weighted average ownership percentage in the entities
throughout the period, and capital is allocated based on the ownership percentage at year-end. Any difference between the weighted average
and point-in-time allocations is presented as a reallocation of non-controlling interest as a component of shareholders equity.

PARTNERSHIP
AGREEMENT 

The
Partnership Agreement of the Partnership provides for the issuance of two classes of Limited Partnership units, Class A and Class B.
Class A and Class B Partnership units are identical in all respects. On January 31, 2023 and 2022, 
 Class A Partnership units were outstanding, representing 
of the total Partnership units, respectively. Additionally, as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, 
 Class B Partnership units were outstanding to and owned by James Wirth, the Trust s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
and Mr. Wirth s affiliates, representing 
ownership in the Partnership. If all the Class A and B Partnership units were converted on January 31, 2023 and 2021, the limited partners
in the Partnership would receive 
 Shares of Beneficial Interest of the Trust. As of January 31, 2023, and 2022, the Trust owns 
 general partner units in the Partnership, representing 
of the total Partnership units. 

On
February 1, 2021, an investor sold RRF units to the Trust. 

On
July 27, 2021, an investor converted RRF units to IHT shares of beneficial interest. 

On
January 31, 2023, the total IHT Shares of Beneficial Interest are . Total Class A and Class B RRF Limited Partnership units
are . The total diluted shares that are convertible one for one is . 

LIQUIDITY 

The
Trust s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements is revenues from hotel room reservations and from RRF Management
fees from the Tucson, Arizona and Albuquerque, New Mexico properties. The Trust s liquidity, including our ability to make distributions
to its shareholders, will depend upon the ability of the Trust and the Partnership s ability to generate sufficient cash flow from
hotel operations and to service debt, as well as to generate funds from repayment of intercompany advances and sale of assets. The Covid-19
Virus (the Virus as of March 15, 2020, had previously disrupted the quarterly distributions from both the Albuquerque
and Tucson hotels. These quarterly distributions from both the Albuquerque and Tucson hotels resumed February 15, 2022. 

At
a future date, the Trust may receive cash from hotel and/or energy operations and/or full or partial sale of one or both hotels, and/or
its investments. 

As
of January 31, 2023, the Trust had a related party Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note with an amount payable of
 . The Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note accrues interest at per annum and requires interest only payments.
The Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note has a maximum borrowing capacity to , which is available through December
31, 2021, and automatically renews annually. This is a two-way Line of Credit, with both the Trust and an Affiliate lender having access
to draw on the credit amount of up to for either party. 

As
of January 31, 2023, the Trust had an amount receivable of the Advances to Affiliate credit facility of approximately . 

As
of January 31, 2023, the Trust had three Revolving lines of Credit totaling with the Republic Bank of Arizona. The lines had
a zero balance as of January 31, 2023. 

With
approximately of cash as of January 31, 2023, the availability of the combined Advance to Affiliate credit facilities,
and the Revolving Line of Credit with Republic Bank, the Trust believes that it has and will have enough cash on hand to meet
all of the financial obligations as they become due for twelve months from the date of filing this 10-K. In addition, management is analyzing
other strategic options available to the Trust, including the sale or refinance of one or both Hotel properties, or other investments.
However, such transactions may not be available on terms that are favorable to the Trust, or at all. 

There
can be no assurance that the Trust will be successful selling properties, refinancing debt or raising additional or replacement funds,
or that these funds may be available on terms that are favorable to it. If the Trust is unable to raise additional or replacement funds,
it may be required to sell certain of our assets to meet liquidity needs, which may not be on terms that are favorable. 

SEASONALITY
OF THE HOTEL BUSINESS 

The
Hotels operations historically have been somewhat seasonal. The Tucson Arizona Hotel historically experiences the highest occupancy
in the first fiscal quarter (the winter high season) and, to a lesser extent, the fourth fiscal quarter. The second fiscal quarter (summer
low season) historically tends to be the lowest occupancy period at this Arizona Hotel. This seasonality pattern can be expected to cause
fluctuations in the Trust s quarterly revenues. The Hotel located in Albuquerque, New Mexico historically experiences its most
profitable periods during the second and third fiscal quarters (the summer high season), providing some balance to the general seasonality
of the Trust s hotel business. 

The
seasonal nature of the Trust s business increases its vulnerability to risks such as travel disruptions, labor force shortages
and cash flow issues. Further, if an adverse event such as an actual or threatened virus pandemic, terrorist attack, international conflict,
data breach, regional economic downturn or poor weather should occur at either of its two hotels, the adverse impact to the Trust s
revenues and profit could be significant. 

The
Trust s operations are affected by numerous factors, including the economy, inflation, virus/pandemic, competition in the hotel
industry and the effect of the economy and interest rates, on the travel and hospitality industries. The Trust cannot predict if any
of the above items will have a significant impact in the future, nor can it predict what impact, if any, the occurrence of these or other
events might have on the Trust s operations and cash flows. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include, but
are not limited to, the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets, recoverability of long-lived assets, interest rates affecting discounting
of future funds to the current types of inflation, and the fair values of the long-lived assets. 

years for buildings and improvements, and to years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment. 

Land
is an indefinite-lived asset. The Trust tests its land for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicates
an impairment may have occurred, by comparing its carrying value to its implied fair value. 

For
tax purposes the Trust takes advantage of accelerated depreciation methods (MACRS) for new capital additions and improvements to its
Hotels. 

Management
applies guidance ASC 360-10-35, to determine when it is required to test an asset for recoverability of its carrying value and whether,
or not, an impairment exists. Under ASC 360-10-35, the Trust is required to test a long-lived asset for impairment when there is an indicator
of impairment. Impairment indicators may include, but are not limited to, a drop in the performance of a long-lived asset, a decline
in the hospitality industry or a decline in the economy. If an indicator of potential impairment is present, then an assessment is performed
of whether the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows over its estimated remaining life. 

If
the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the asset s estimated remaining life are greater than the asset s carrying
value, no impairment is recognized; however, if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows,
then the Trust would recognize an impairment expense to the extent the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value, if any. The
estimated future cash flows are based upon, among other things, assumptions about expected future operating performance, and may differ
from actual cash flows. Long-lived assets evaluated for impairment are analyzed on a property-specific basis independent of the cash
flows of other groups of assets. Evaluation of future cash flows is based on historical experience and other factors, including certain
economic conditions, and committed future bookings. Management has determined no impairment for the Fiscal Years ended January 31, 2023,
and January 31, 2022, respectively. 

warrants were exercised for and in return the Trust received shares
of UniGen. As of January 31, 2023, the Trust owned shares of common stock in UniGen Power, Inc. (UniGen), a non-affiliated privately
held entity, at a cost of . As of January 31, 2023, the Trust accounted for such securities at cost minus impairment due to the
investment not being traded on an active market noting that UniGen had limited operations and was still in the start-up and research
and development stage. Management believes recording the investment at cost approximates fair value since there have been no significant
changes in the operations of UniGen and UniGen s projects are still in the R D phase. 

of balances over
90 days and of balances over 120 days. Accounts receivable are written off when collection efforts have been exhausted and they
are deemed uncollectible. Recoveries, if any, of receivables previously written off are recorded when received. The Trust does not charge
interest on accounts receivable balances and these receivables are unsecured. There is in the allowance for doubtful accounts for
the Fiscal Years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. 

IHT fully paid restricted Shares per year. All shares vest over one year
from date of grant. The Trust has paid the annual fees due to its Trustees by issuing Shares of Beneficial Interest out of its authorized
but unissued Shares. Upon issuance, the Trust recognizes the shares as outstanding. The Trust recognizes expense related to the issuance
based on the fair value of the shares upon the date of the restricted share grant and amortizes the expense equally over the period during
which the shares vest to the Trustees. From time to time, the Trustees and key employees receive one-time fully paid restricted share
grants, as well. 

In
addition, IHT Restricted Shares were issued to each of the Trust s three accountants, and restricted IHT Shares to
each of the three IHT employees. The shares were fully vested at January 31, 2023.

of assets. The Trust has paid uninterrupted dividends annually for 52 consecutive years since the Trust registered in 1971, and listed
with the NYSE. 

Shares of the Beneficial Interest, as discussed in Note 1. 

For
the Fiscal Years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, there were Class A and Class B Partnership units outstanding, which are convertible
into Shares of Beneficial Interest of the Trust. Assuming conversion at the beginning of each period, the aggregate weighted-average
of these Shares of Beneficial Interest would have been in addition to the basic shares outstanding for the years ended January
31, 2023 and 2022. These Shares of Beneficial Interest issuable upon conversion of the Class A and Class B Partnership units were anti-dilutive
during the years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 and are excluded in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for those periods. 

and for the twelve
months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is reported in the consolidated Statement of Operations. 

of the membership interests in the Albuquerque
entity and the parties agreed to restructure the operating agreement of the Albuquerque entity. A total of units were available for
sale for per unit, with a two-unit minimum subscription. On September 24, 2010, the parties revised the Amended and Restated
Operating Agreement to name Rare Earth as the administrative member of the Albuquerque entity in charge of the day-to-day management. 

On
December 9, 2013, the Trust entered into an updated restructuring agreement with Rare Earth to allow for the sale of additional interest
units in the Albuquerque entity for per unit. Under the updated restructuring agreement, Rare Earth agreed to either purchase
or bring in other investors to purchase up to (and potentially up to if the overallotment is exercised) units. Under the terms
of the updated restructuring agreement, the Trust agreed to hold at least of the outstanding units in the Albuquerque entity, on
a post-transaction basis, and intends to maintain this minimum ownership percentage through the purchase of units under this offering.
The Board of Trustees approved this restructuring on December 9, 2013. The units in the Albuquerque entity are allocated to three classes
with differing cumulative discretionary priority distribution rights through December 31, 2015. Class A units are owned by unrelated
third parties and have priority for distributions. Class B units are owned by the Trust and have second priority for distributions. Class
C units are owned by Rare Earth or other affiliates of Mr. Wirth and have the lowest priority for distributions from the Albuquerque
entity. Priority distributions of per unit per year were cumulative until December 31, 2015; however, after December 31, 2015 Class
A unit holders continue to hold a preference on distributions over Class B and Class C unit holders. The Trust does not accrue for these
distributions as the preference periods have expired. 

The
Trust has sold non-controlling interests in certain subsidiaries, including Albuquerque Suite Hospitality, LLC (the Albuquerque
entity and Tucson Hospitality Properties, LLLP (the Tucson entity, which sales are described in detail in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K filed on May 27, 2022 with the Securities and Exchange Commissions. Generally, interests have sold for per unit
with a two-unit minimum subscription. The Trust maintains at least of the units in one of the entities and intends to maintain
this minimum ownership percentage. Generally, the units in the each of the entities are allocated to three classes with differing cumulative
discretionary priority distribution rights through a certain time period. Class A units are owned by unrelated third parties and have
priority for distributions. Class B units are owned by the Trust and have second priority for distributions. Class C units are owned
by Rare Earth or other affiliates of Mr. Wirth and have the lowest priority for distributions. Priority distributions of per unit
per year were cumulative until a certain date; however, after that date, generally Class A unit holders continue to hold a preference
on distributions over Class B and Class C unit holders. The Trust does not accrue for these distributions as the preference periods have
expired. 

On
February 15, 2017, the Trust and Partnership entered into a restructuring agreement with Rare Earth Financial, LLC REF to allow for the sale of non-controlling partnership units in Albuquerque Suite Hospitality LLC Albuquerque for 
per unit, which operates the Best Western InnSuites Albuquerque Hotel and Suites Airport hotel property, a 112 unit hotel in Albuquerque,
New Mexico (the Property ). REF and IHT restructured the Albuquerque Membership Interest by creating additional Class
A membership interests from General Member majority-owned to accredited investor member-owned. In the event of sale of Class A Interests,
total interests outstanding changed from to with Class A, Class B and Class C Limited Liability Company Interests (referred to
collectively as Interests restructured with IHT selling approximately Class B Interests to accredited investors as
Class A Interest. REF, as an Administrative Manager of Albuquerque, coordinating the offering and sale of Class A Interests to qualified
third parties. REF, IHT, and other REF Affiliates may purchase Interests from time to time. Rare Earth, as a General Partner of the Albuquerque
entity, will coordinate the offering and sale of Class A Interests to qualified third parties. Rare Earth and other Rare Earth affiliates
may purchase Interests under the offering. As part of this offering, Rare Earth was paid for a restructuring fee which was recorded
in Equity. This restructuring is part of the Trust s Equity Enhancement Plan to comply with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE American
Company Guide. For the Fiscal Year ending January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Trust purchased a net of units, and sold units, respectively. 

Three
Class A units were sold back to the Trust during the Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2023 for . Two Class A units were sold during

interest, or Class A units. 

units, which represents approximately of the outstanding limited partnership units in the Tucson entity, on a post-transaction basis,
and the parties agreed to restructure the limited partnership agreement of the Tucson entity. The Board of Trustees approved this restructuring
on January 31, 2011. 

On
October 1, 2013, the Partnership entered into an updated restructured limited partnership agreement with Rare Earth to allow for the
sale of additional interest units in the Tucson entity for per unit. Under the agreement, Rare Earth agreed to either purchase
or bring in other investors to purchase up to (and potentially up to if the overallotment is exercised) units. Under the terms
of the updated restructuring agreement, the Partnership agreed to hold at least of the outstanding limited partnership units in
the Tucson entity, on a post-transaction basis, and intends to maintain this minimum ownership percentage through the purchase of units
under this offering. The Board of Trustees approved this restructuring on September 14, 2013. The limited partnership interests in the
Tucson entity are allocated to three classes with differing cumulative discretionary priority distribution rights through June 30, 2017.
Class A units are owned by unrelated third parties and have priority for distributions. Class B units are owned by the Partnership and
have second priority for distributions. Class C units are owned by Rare Earth or other affiliates of Mr. Wirth and have the lowest priority
for distributions from the Tucson entity. Priority distributions of per unit per year are cumulative until June 30, 2016; however,
after June 30, 2016 Class A unit holders continue to hold a preference on distributions over Class B and Class C unit holders. The Trust
does not accrue for these distributions as the preference periods have expired. 

If
certain triggering events related to the Tucson entity occur prior to the payment of all accumulated distributions to its members, such
accumulated distributions will be paid out of any proceeds of the event before general distribution of the proceeds to the members. In
the event that funds generated from a triggering event are insufficient to pay the total amount of all such accumulated distributions
owed to the members, all Class A members will participate pro rata in the funds available for distribution to them until paid in full,
then Class B, and then Class C. After all investors have received their initial capital plus a per annum simple return, any additional
profits will be allocated to Rare Earth, with the remaining allocated proportionately to all unit classes. Rare Earth also received
a restructuring fee of , conditioned upon and arising from the sale of the first units in the Tucson entity following the
October 1, 2013 restructuring. The Tucson entity plans to use its best efforts to pay the discretionary priority distributions. The Trust
does not guarantee and is not otherwise obligated to pay the cumulative discretionary priority distributions. RRF Limited Partnership
will continue to provide management, licensing and reservation services to the Tucson, Arizona property 

As
of January 31, 2023, the Partnership held a ownership interest, or Class B units, in the Tucson entity, Mr. Wirth and his
affiliates held a interest, or approximately Class C units, and other parties held a interest, or approximately Class
A units. For the Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2023, the Tucson entity made quarterly Priority Return payments. 

During
the Fiscal Years ended January 31, 2023, and January 31, 2022, neither the Trust nor the Partnership have provided any implicit or explicit
financial support for which they were not previously contracted, respectively. Both the Partnership and the Trust provided mortgage loan
guarantees which allow our properties to obtain new financing as needed, including the refinance of the Tucson Hotel on March 29, 2022.

Trust had an ownership change within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 382. However, the Trust determined that such ownership
change would not have a material impact on the future use of the net operating losses. 

The
Trust amended the federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018, resulting in a recalculation of the net operating
loss carry-forward. The impact of the amended returns are reflected in the below data.

The
Trust is taxed as a C-Corporation. The Trust s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters
in income tax expense. The Trust has received various IRS and state tax jurisdiction notices which the Trust in the process of responding
to in which management believes the notices are without merit and expect full remediation of all tax notices. The Trust and subsidiaries
have deferred tax assets of million which includes cumulative net operating loss carryforwards of million and syndications
of million, and deferred tax liability associated with book/tax differences of million as of January 31, 2023. We have evaluated
the net deferred tax asset and determined that it is not more likely than not we will receive full benefit from the net operating loss
carryforwards. Therefore, we have determined a valuation allowance of approximately million.

Membership
Agreements: 

InnSuites
Hotels has entered into membership agreements with Best Western International, Inc. Best Western for both hotel properties.
In exchange for use of the Best Western name, trademark and reservation system, all Hotels pay fees to Best Western based on reservations
received through the use of the Best Western reservation system and the number of available suites at the Hotels. The agreements with
Best Western have no specific expiration terms and may be cancelled by either party. Best Western requires that the hotels meet certain
requirements for room quality, and the Hotels are subject to removal from its reservation system if these requirements are not met. The
Hotels with third-party membership agreements received significant reservations through the Best Western reservation system. Under these
arrangements, fees paid for membership fees and reservations were approximately and for the Fiscal Years ended January
31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These costs include fees for the Albuquerque and Tucson hotels in 2022. These fees are included in room
operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations for Albuquerque and Tucson. 

Litigation: 

The
Trust is involved from time to time in various other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion
of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Trust s unaudited condensed
consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

The
nature of the operations of the Hotels exposes them to risks of claims and litigation in the normal course of their business. Although
the outcome of these matters cannot be determined and is covered by insurance, management does not expect that the ultimate resolution
of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations
or liquidity of the Trust. 

Indemnification: 

The
Trust has entered into indemnification agreements with all of our executive officers and Trustees. The agreements provide for indemnification
against all liabilities and expenses reasonably incurred by an officer or Trustee in connection with the defense or disposition of any
suit or other proceeding, in which he or she may be involved or with which he or she may be threatened, while in office or thereafter,
because of his or her position at the Trust. There is no indemnification for any matter as to which an officer or Trustee is adjudicated
to have acted in bad faith, with willful misconduct or reckless disregard of his or her duties, with gross negligence, or not in good
faith in the reasonable belief that his or her action was in the Trust s best interests. These agreements require the Trust, among
other things, to indemnify the director or officer against specified expenses and liabilities, such as attorneys fees, judgments,
fines and settlements, paid by the individual in connection with any action, suit or proceeding arising out of the individual s
status or service as our director or officer, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct or conduct that is knowingly fraudulent
or deliberately dishonest, and to advance expenses incurred by the individual in connection with any proceeding against the individual
with respect to which the individual may be entitled to indemnification by us. The Trust may advance payments in connection with indemnification
under the agreements. The level of indemnification is to the full extent of the net equity based on appraised and/or market value of
the Trust. Historically, the Trust has not incurred any payments for these obligations and, therefore, no liabilities have been recorded
for these indemnities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

. These restricted shares, each to the three Independent Trustees), vest in equal monthly
amounts during Fiscal Year 2023. 

On

paid IHT restricted shares. The aggregate grant date fair value of these Shares was approximately . These shares partially vest
on December 31, 2022, and May 31, 2023, in two equal amounts. 

In
addition, IHT Restricted Shares were issued to each of the Trust s three accountants, and restricted IHT Shares to
each of the three IHT employees. The shares were fully vested at January 31, 2023.

to for the twelve months ended January 31, 2023 from approximately 
 for the twelve months ended January 31, 2022. This represents a reversal of liability arising from an occupancy tax discrepancy
generated from our Tucson Oracle and Albuquerque hotels from prior periods, as the liabilities had been assumed by a related party. These
additional amounts were due for Hotel sales and occupancy expenses owed by hotel guests that were erroneously not collected at the time
of stay, nor remitted to the respective states accordingly, and are not expected to be recurring, since the Trust collects and remits
all necessary occupancy taxes to the state monthly. The related party was responsible for these liabilities initially and they were never
owed by either Hotel property. 

No
additional assessments have transpired since September 2020. Management has assessed the materiality of the discrepancy on prior reported
periods and has concluded it is qualitatively immaterial to the readers of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

per share per Fiscal Year. In the Fiscal Years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Trust paid dividends
of per share per share in each of the second and the fourth quarters. The Trust has paid dividends each Fiscal Year since its inception
in 1971. The Trust paid the scheduled semi-annual dividend payable on July 29, 2022, as well as February 1, 2023, and is once again anticipated for July 31, 2023. 

The
Trust s Management received communication from the NYSE-American on August 29, 2022, indicating IHT is fully compliant with all
of the Continued Listing Standards Equity Requirements set forth in Part 10 of the NYSE American Company Guide, of the NYSE-American. 

Subsequent
to the Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2023 the Trust repurchased Shares of Beneficial Interest on the open market for a total
cash repurchase price of approximately . 

Hotel
Operation results of the Albuquerque Hotel and the Tucson Hotel both achieved record results for the Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2023.
Increased record results are expected for the two hotels, during the Fiscal Year 2024, ending January 31, 2024. IHT reported a strong annual improvement of results in Fiscal Year 2023, (February 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023),
with Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests doubling, increasing by , to as compared to . Earnings Per
Share based on this Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest amount was , also more than doubling, up from the prior
year of . Total Revenues increased to approximately million, which is an approximate increase of from the same prior Fiscal
Year total of million. Consolidated Net Income before non-cash depreciation expense was for the Fiscal Year ended January
31, 2023. IHT hotel operations are contributing to a solid start in the current 2024 Fiscal First Quarter, with both the Tucson Hotel
and Albuquerque Hotel achieving record results for the combined months of February, March, and April 2023 of the current Fiscal Year.
These are all positive signs for InnSuites, as progress continues heading in the right direction as the Travel Industry, and InnSuites
Hospitality Trust (IHT) specifically, continue to rebound and thrive.

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Based on this
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and our Chief Financial Officer (CFO), concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were fully effective as of January 31, 2023. 

Our
management, including our CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent
all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision
of the Trust s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected by the Trust s Board of Trustees, management
and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Assessment
of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on management s assessment, management concluded our internal control over
financial reporting was fully effective as of January 31, 2023. 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

In
an effort to remediate past deficiencies and enhance the Trust s internal control over financial reporting, the Trust previously
increased its technical accounting expertise by hiring a new Chief Financial Officer, and in Fiscal 2023 a Corporate Assistant Controller,
and Two Staff Accountants to assist with the Trust s technical accounting and internal control issues. The CFO has extensive public
company reporting experience, to further assist with the Trust s technical accounting and internal controls. 

We
need to take appropriate and reasonable additional steps to make necessary improvements to our Accounting staff and internal control
over financial reporting, which will require management to support the hiring and training of sufficient personnel with appropriate training
and expertise in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. This increase to staffing and training will allow us
to make the necessary improvements, including: 

Continuing
 to improve the control environment through (i) being staffed with sufficient number of personnel to address segregation of duties
 issues, ineffective controls and to perform control monitoring activities, (ii) increasing the level of GAAP knowledge by retaining
 additional technical accountants, (iii) implementing formal process to account for non-standard transactions, and (iv) implementing
 and formalizing management oversight of financial reporting at regular intervals; 

Continuing
 to update the documentation of our internal control processes, including implementing formal risk assessment processes and entity
 level controls; 

Implementing
 control activities that address relevant risks and assure that all transactions are subject to such control activities; Ensure systems
 that impact financial information and disclosures have effective information technology controls; 

Implementing
 plan to increase oversight and review of ad hoc spreadsheets while also working to reduce their use; 

We
 are in the process of further enhancing the supervisory procedures to include additional levels of analysis and quality control reviews
 within the accounting and financial reporting functions; and 

IHT
 previously filled the previously vacant position of Chief Financial Officer (CFO), to assist with the Trust s internal controls
 oversight. 

IHT
 created and filled the position of Assistant Controller, to further assist with the Trust s internal controls oversight, and
 process accounting. 

49 

We
believe that the remediation measures described above have and will continue to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting
and remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified. These remediation efforts were implemented throughout Fiscal Year 2023.
Additional strengthening is expected in the current Fiscal Year 2024, as well. 

Despite
the deficiencies reported above, our management believes that our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2023 fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows for the periods presented and that this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
to the periods covered by this report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed Fiscal quarter ended January 31,
2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We
had significant turnover in our accounting department over the last 24 months, with the several new additions aforementioned above. These
new additions should assist with the Trust s stability, technical accounting, and internal control issues.

Trustee
Nominations and Qualifications 

The
Governance and Nominating Committee expects to identify nominees to serve as our Trustees primarily by accepting and considering the
suggestions and nominee recommendations made by members of the Board of Trustees and our management and shareholders. Nominees for Trustees
are evaluated based on their character, judgment, independence, financial or business acumen, diversity of experience, ability to represent
and act on behalf of all of our shareholders, and the needs of the Board of Trustees. In accordance with its charter, the Governance
and Nominating Committee discusses diversity of experience as one of many factors in identifying nominees for Trustee, but does not have
a policy of assessing diversity with respect to any particular qualities or attributes. All of the current Trustees are men, due to the
departure of one woman and the reduction of Board size to five, during fiscal 2019. The Governance and Nominating Committee has not identified
any specific attributes that the Committee would desire to diversify on the Board. In general, before evaluating any nominee, the Governance
and Nominating Committee first determines the need for additional Trustees to fill vacancies or expand the size of the Board of Trustees
and the likelihood that a nominee can satisfy the evaluation criteria. The Governance and Nominating Committee would expect to re-nominate
incumbent Trustees who have served well on the Board of Trustees and express an interest in continuing to serve. Our Board of Trustees
is satisfied that the backgrounds and qualifications of our Trustees, considered as a group, provide a mix of experience, knowledge and
abilities that allows our Board to fulfill its responsibilities. 

The
Governance and Nominating Committee will consider shareholder recommendations for Trustee nominees. A shareholder who wishes to suggest
a Trustee nominee for consideration by the Governance and Nominating Committee should send a resume of the nominee s business experience
and background to Mr. Ronnie Chase, Chairperson of the Governance and Nominating Committee, InnSuites Hospitality Trust, 1730 E. Northern
Avenue, Suite 122, Phoenix, Arizona 85020. The mailing envelope and letter must contain a clear notation indicating that the enclosed
letter is a Shareholder-Board of Trustees Nominee. 

Leadership
Structure of the Board of Trustees 

Mr.
Wirth, our Chief Executive Officer, currently serves as Chairman of the Board. Our Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust,
as amended, provides that the Trustees shall annually elect a Chairman who shall be the principal officer of the Trust. Mr. Wirth has
served as Chairman of our Board of Trustees and our Chief Executive Officer since January 30, 1998. Our Board of Trustees has determined
that the Trust has been well-served by this structure of combined Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions and that this structure
facilitates strong and clear leadership, with a single person setting the tone of the organization and having the ultimate responsibility
for all of the Trust s operating and strategic functions, thus providing unified leadership and direction for the Board of Trustees
and the Trust s executive management. Our Chairman also has a significant investment in our Shares, which we believe provides him
with a strong incentive to advance shareholder interests. 

52 

The
Trust does not have a lead independent Trustee but receives strong leadership from all of its members. Our Board Committees consist of
three independent Trustee members, and our independent Trustees meet at least annually in executive session without the presence of non-independent
Trustees and management. In addition, our Trustees take active and substantial roles in the activities of our Board of Trustees at the
full Board meetings. Our Trustees are able to propose items for Board meeting agendas, and the Board s meetings include time for
discussion of items not on the formal agenda. Our Board believes that this open structure, as compared to a system in which there is
a designated lead independent trustee, facilitates a greater sense of responsibility among our Trustees and facilitates active and effective
oversight by the independent Trustees of the Trust s operations and strategic initiatives, including any risks. 

The
Board s Role in Risk Oversight 

Our
management devotes significant attention to risk management, and our Board of Trustees is engaged in the oversight of this activity,
both at the full Board and at the Board Committee level. The Board s role in risk oversight does not affect the Board s leadership
structure. However, our Board s leadership structure supports such risk oversight by combining the Chairman position with the Chief
Executive Officer position (the person with primary corporate responsibility for risk management). 

Our
Board s role in the Trust s risk oversight process includes receiving reports from members of senior management on areas
of material risk to the Trust, including operational, financial, legal, and regulatory and strategic risks. The Board of Trustees requires
management to report to the full Board (or an appropriate Committee) on a variety of matters at regular meetings of the Board and on
an as-needed basis, including the performance and operations of the Trust and other matters relating to risk management. The Audit Committee
also receives regular reports from the Trust s independent registered public accounting firm on internal control and financial
reporting matters. In addition, pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee is tasked with reviewing with the Trust s counsel
major litigation risks as well as compliance with applicable laws and regulations, discussing with management its procedures for monitoring
compliance with the Trust s code of conduct, and discussing significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken
to monitor, control and report such exposures. These reviews are conducted in conjunction with the Board s risk oversight function
and enable the Board to review and assess any material risks facing the Trust. 

Our
Board also works to oversee risk through its consideration and authorization of significant matters, such as major strategic, operational,
and financial initiatives and its oversight of management s implementation of those initiatives. The Board periodically reviews
with management its strategies, techniques, policies, and procedures designed to manage these risks. Under the overall supervision of
our Board, management has implemented a variety of processes, procedures, and controls to address these risks. 

Communications
with the Board of Trustees 

Shareholders
and other interested parties who wish to communicate with the Board of Trustees or any individual member thereof may do so by writing
to the Secretary, InnSuites Hospitality Trust, 1730 E. Northern Avenue, Suite 122, Phoenix, Arizona 85020. The mailing envelope and letter
must contain a clear notation indicating that the enclosed letter is an Interested Party-Board of Trustees Communication. 
The Secretary will review all such correspondence and regularly forward to the Board of Trustees a log and summary of all such correspondence
and copies of all correspondence that, in the opinion of the Secretary, deals with the functions of the Board of Trustees or Committees
thereof or that he otherwise determines requires their attention. Trustees may at any time review a log of all correspondence received
by us that is addressed to members of the Board of Trustees and request copies of any such correspondence. Concerns relating to accounting,
internal controls or auditing matters are immediately brought to the attention of our accounting department and handled in accordance
with procedures established by the Audit Committee for such matters. 

53 

Date
of 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Shareholder Proposals 

We
expect that the 2023 Annual Meeting will be held in July or August, 2023. Therefore, the deadline for submitting shareholder proposals
for inclusion in our proxy statement and form of proxy for the 2023 Annual Meeting will be on or before July 1, 2023, which we believe
is a reasonable deadline for submission before we begin the printing and mailing of our proxy materials for the 2023 Annual Meeting.
A shareholder who wishes to present a proposal at the 2023 Annual Meeting but does not wish to have that proposal included in our proxy
statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting, will need to notify us of the proposal before July 1, 2023. When the date for the
2023 Annual Meeting is set, we will announce updated shareholder proposal deadlines. If notice of the proposal is not received by us
by that date, then the proposal will be deemed untimely, and we will have the right to exercise discretionary voting authority and vote
proxies returned to us with respect to that proposal. 

Shareholders
should submit their proposals to InnSuites Hospitality Trust, 1730 E. Northern Avenue, Suite 122, Phoenix, Arizona 85020, Attention:
Mr. Marc Berg, Secretary. 

Audit
Committee Information and Audit Committee Financial Expert 

The
Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of our independent auditors,
including reviewing the scope and results of audit and non-audit services. The Audit Committee also reviews internal accounting controls
and assesses the independence of our auditors. In addition, the Audit Committee has established procedures for the receipt, retention
and treatment of any complaints received by us regarding accounting, internal controls or auditing matters and the confidential, anonymous
submission by our employees of any concerns regarding accounting or auditing matters. The Audit Committee has the authority to engage
independent counsel and other advisors as it deems necessary to carry out its duties. The Audit Committee met four (4) times during Fiscal
Year 2023. 

All
members of the Audit Committee are independent, as such term is defined by the SEC s rules and the NYSE American
listing standards. The Board of Trustees has determined that Mr. Kutasi, a member of our Audit Committee, qualifies as an audit
committee financial expert under applicable SEC rules. We have posted our Amended and Restated Audit Committee Charter on our
Internet website at www.innsuitestrust.com. Information on our website is not part of this Amendment. 

Audit
Committee Report 

The
Audit Committee of the Board of Trustees has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Trust s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal Years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 with the management of the Trust. In addition, the Audit
Committee has discussed with BF Borgers CPA PC BF Borgers ), the independent registered public accounting firm of the Trust,
the matters required to be discussed under Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with
Audit Committees . The Audit Committee has also received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from BF Borgers required
by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditor s communications
with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with BF Borgers its independence from the Trust, including the compatibility
of any non-audit services with BF Borgers s independence. The Audit Committee has also pre-approved the fees to be charged to the
Trust by its independent auditors for audit services. 

Based
on the foregoing, the Audit Committee recommended that such audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Trust s
Annual Report for the Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2023.

Code
of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers 

We
have adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller, and persons performing
similar functions. We have posted our Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers on our website at www.innsuitestrust.com. We intend
to satisfy all SEC and NYSE AMERICAN disclosure requirements regarding any amendment to, or waiver of, the Code of Ethics relating to
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and persons performing similar functions, by posting such information on our
website unless the NYSE AMERICAN requires a Form 8-K. In addition, we have adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of
our employees, officers and Trustees. It is also available on our website at www.innsuitestrust.com. 

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our Trustees, executive officers, and beneficial holders of more than 10 of our Shares to file with
the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of subsequent changes in ownership. The SEC has established specific due dates for these
reports, and we are required to disclose any late filings or failures to file during the last Fiscal Year. 

Based
solely on our review of the copies of such forms (and amendments thereto) furnished to us and written representations from reporting
persons that no additional reports were required, we believe that all our Trustees, executive officers, and holders of more than 10 
of the Shares complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements during the Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2023, except as set forth
above. 

Item
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

Executive
Compensation Overview 

The
following overview relates to the compensation of our executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table set forth below during
Fiscal Year 2023. Our executive officers are James F. Wirth, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Marc E. Berg,
Vice Chairman, Executive Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer, and Sylvin Lange, Chief Financial Officer, (referred to below as our
 executive officers ). 

Overview
of the Compensation Committee 

The
Compensation Committee of the Board of Trustees currently consists of three independent Trustees. The Committee sets the principles and
strategies that serve to guide the design of the compensation programs for our executive officers. The Committee annually evaluates the
performance of our executive officers. Taking into consideration the factors set forth below, the Committee then approves their compensation
levels, including any bonuses. The Committee does not use an independent compensation consultant to assist it with its responsibilities.
The Committee does consider input from the Chief Executive Officer when determining compensation for the other executive officers. 

Compensation
Philosophy and Objectives 

Under
the supervision of the Compensation Committee, we have developed and implemented compensation policies, plans and programs that seek
to enhance our ability to recruit and retain qualified management and other personnel. In developing and implementing compensation policies
and procedures, the Compensation Committee seeks to provide rewards for the long-term value of an individual s contribution to
the Trust. The Compensation Committee seeks to develop policies and procedures that offer both recurring and non-recurring, and both
financial and non-financial, incentives. 

Compensation
for our executive officers has two main monetary components, salary, and bonus, as well as a benefits component. A base salary is a fixed
compensation component subject to annual adjustment and review, if appropriate, that is designed to attract, retain, and motivate our
executive officers and to align their compensation with market practices. As discussed below, for Fiscal Year 2022, the bonus component
consisted of cash bonuses that were intended to incentivize performance, as described below. 

55 

Our
compensation program does not rely to any significant extent on broad-based benefits or prerequisites. The benefits offered to our executive
officers are those that are offered to all of our full-time employees. We do not offer our executive officers any prerequisites. 

Our
management and the Compensation Committee work in a cooperative fashion. Management advises the Compensation Committee on compensation
developments, compensation packages and our overall compensation program. The Compensation Committee then reviews, modifies, if necessary,
and approves the compensation packages for our executive officers. 

Elements
of Compensation 

In
setting the compensation for each executive officer, the Compensation Committee considers (i) the responsibility and authority of each
position relative to other positions within the Trust, (ii) the individual performance of each executive officer, (iii) the experience
and skills of the executive officer, and (iv) the importance of the executive officer to the Trust. 

Base
Salary 

We
pay base salaries to our executive officers in order to provide a level of assured compensation reflecting an estimate of the value in
the employment market of the executive officer s skills, the demands of his or her position and the relative size of the Trust.
In establishing base salaries for our executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers our overall performance and the performance
of each individual executive officer, as well as market forces and other general factors believed to be relevant, including time between
salary increases, promotion, expansion of responsibilities, advancement potential, and the execution of special or difficult projects.
Additionally, the Compensation Committee takes into account the relative salaries of the executive officers and determines what it believes
are appropriate compensation level distinctions between and among the executive officers, including between the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer and among the other executive officers. Although the Compensation Committee considers our financial performance,
there is no specific relationship between achieving, or failing to achieve, budgeted estimates, the performance of our Shares or our
financial performance and the annual salaries determined by the Compensation Committee for any of our executive officers. No specific
weight is attributed to any of the factors considered by the Compensation Committee; the Compensation Committee considers all factors
and makes a subjective determination based upon the experience of its members and the recommendations of our management. 

As
Mr. Wirth holds a significant ownership stake in the Trust, the Compensation Committee did not increase his salary or provide him with
additional incentives. Based upon a review of Mr. Wirth s performance and upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee,
for Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022, Mr. Wirth s annual base salary remained set at 153,060. The Compensation Committee did not rely
on any particular set of financial or non-financial factors, measures or criteria when determining the compensation offered to Mr. Wirth.
The Compensation Committee did consider Mr. Wirth s substantial Share ownership when setting his base salary. 

Cash
and Equity Bonuses 

Fiscal
2023 Bonuses 

Fiscal
2023 Full Year Cash and Equity Bonus Program 

On
January 29, 2019, the Compensation Committee adopted an incentive bonus program for the Executives for the full Fiscal Year ended January
31, 2023 (the 2021 Fiscal Year Bonus Program ). Under the 2019 Fiscal Year Bonus Program, an Executive will be entitled
to receive a bonus, upon the achievement by the Executive of performance-based on objectives which was based on exceeding budgeted revenues
and net income in hotel operations. 

56 

Fiscal
2023 - Performance-Based Cash Bonuses 

Our
executive officers are eligible to receive cash bonuses under the General Manager Bonus Plan equal to 15 of the aggregate cash bonuses
received by the general managers of all of our hotels, regardless of region. The general managers receive a bonus based on the achievement
of budgeted gross operating profit (total revenues less operating expenses) GOP at their hotel on a quarterly and annual
basis. Under the plan, if the hotel s actual quarterly and annual GOP exceeds the budgeted GOP, each general manager is eligible
for a potential maximum annual bonus of 20,000, consisting of a potential maximum quarterly bonus of 2,000 per quarter, 8,000 per
year), and a potential maximum year-end bonus of 11,000, a risk management bonus of 1,000 and a discretionary excellent property inspection
bonus up to 1,000. 

In
Fiscal Year 2023 ending January 31, 2023, the Board approved a stock bonus of up to 3,000 shares for the CFO, Controller, and our Independent
Consultant. In addition, our Director of Hotel Operations and IT/Technology Manager each were approved for up to 2,000 shares.

maintain broad-based benefits that are provided to all employees, including health and dental insurance, life insurance and a 401(k)
plan. We also have a mandatory matching contribution for our 401(k) plan. We do not have a pension plan. Our executive officers are eligible
to participate in all of our employee benefit plans, in each case on the same basis as our other employees. See Note 23 Share
Based Payments and Stock Options for additional information about our Stock Options.

services rendered by Mr. Marc Berg, the Trust s Executive Vice President. Mr. Berg, and Mr. Lange receive a monthly travel expense
reimbursement of 100. For the Fiscal Year ending January 31, 2023, Mr. Berg, and Mr. Lange received 1,200, and 1,125 respectively in
expense reimbursement. For the Fiscal Year ending January 31, 2022, Mr. Berg, and Mr. Lange received 1,200, and 900, respectively.

 22,500, was paid during the Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2022. 

(4) During Fiscal Year ending January 31, 2023 Mr.
Wirth, Mr. Berg, and Mr. Lange received Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation consisting of Fiscal 2023 Performance Based Cash

Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation consisting of Fiscal 2022 Performance Based Cash Bonuses of 2,245, 7,484, and 7,575,
respectively. 

During
Fiscal Year 2023 and 2022, we did grant other equity-based awards. None of our executive officers owned any stock options, or had any
outstanding unvested Shares, as of January 31, 2023 and 2022. Consistent with ASC 718-10-55-10, compensation cost associated with issuance
of these options has not been recognized as shareholder approval is not perfunctory. For stock option grants additional information about
our stock option plan, see Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements - Stock Options. 

Additionally,
refer Note 23 of our Consolidated Financial Statements - Share Based Payments, and the section on Fiscal Year 2023 Trustee Compensation,
contained in Item11, for information on shares issued to our independent trustees from shareholder equity. 

Indemnification
Agreements 

We
have entered into indemnification agreements with all of our executive officers and Trustees. The agreements provide for indemnification
against all liabilities and expenses reasonably incurred by an officer or Trustee in connection with the defense or disposition of any
suit or other proceeding, in which he or she may be involved or with which he or she may be threatened, while in office or thereafter,
because of his or her position at the Trust. There is no indemnification for any matter as to which an officer or Trustee is adjudicated
to have acted in bad faith, with willful misconduct or reckless disregard of his or her duties, with gross negligence, or not in good
faith in the reasonable belief that his or her action was in our best interests. We may advance payments in connection with indemnification
under the agreements. The level of indemnification is to the full extent of the net equity based on appraised and/or market value of
the Trust. 

58 

Potential
Payments Upon Change in Control 

We
do not have employment agreements with our executive officers. However, our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan provides that the Compensation Committee of the Board of Trustees, in its sole discretion, may take such actions, if any, as it deems
necessary or desirable with respect to any award that is outstanding as of the date of the consummation of the change in control. Such
actions may include, without limitation: (a) the acceleration of the vesting, settlement and/or exercisability of an award; (b) the payment
of a cash amount in exchange for the cancellation of an award; (c) the cancellation of stock options and/or SARs without payment therefor
if the fair market value of a share on the date of the change in control does not exceed the exercise price per share of the applicable
award; and/or (d) the issuance of substitute awards that substantially preserve the value, rights and benefits of any affected awards. 

For
purposes of the 2017 Plan, subject to exceptions set forth in the 2017 Plan, a change in control generally includes (a)
the acquisition of more than 50 of the Trust s Shares; (b) the incumbent board of trustees ceasing to constitute a majority of
the board of trustees; (c) a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Trust; and (d) approval by the shareholders of the Trust of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Trust. The full definition
of change in control is set forth in the 2017 Plan. 

When
an award is granted under the 2017 Plan, the Compensation Committee establishes the terms and conditions of that award, which are contained
in an award agreement. The form of stock option award agreement under the 2017 Plan provides for unvested stock options to immediately
vest in full and become exercisable if a change in control occurs while the participant is employed by the Trust or a subsidiary. In
addition, the form of restricted share agreement for non-employee Trustee awards provides that unvested restricted shares held by a Trustee
will immediately vest in full if, prior to a vesting date, a change in control of the Trust occurs while the participant is serving as
a Trustee. 

A
participant s award agreement under the 2017 Plan may also contain specific provisions governing the vesting or forfeiture of an
award upon a termination of the participant s service to the Trust or a subsidiary. The form of stock option award agreement generally
provides that unvested stock options will become immediately vested in full if, prior to a vesting date, the participant ceases to be
employed by the Trust and its subsidiaries by reason of death or disability. Unvested stock options will be forfeited automatically if
the participant ceases to be employed by the Trust and its subsidiaries prior to an applicable vesting date. In addition, the form of
stock option award agreement provides for the termination of stock options, to the extent not previously exercised or forfeited, on the
earliest of the following dates: (i) one year after the termination of the participant s employment by the Trust and its subsidiaries
due to death or disability; (ii) three months after the termination of the participant s employment with the Trust and its subsidiaries
for any reason other than for death, disability or cause; (iii) immediately upon termination of employment, if the participant s
employment is terminated by the Company and its subsidiaries for cause; or (iv) midnight on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Unless otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement or in an another written agreement with the participant, cause ,
as a reason for termination of a participant s employment generally includes (a) the participant s willful refusal to follow
lawful directives of the Trust which are consistent with the scope and nature of the participant s duties and responsibilities;
(b) conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude, fraud or embezzlement; (c)
gross negligence or willful misconduct resulting in a material loss to the Trust or any of its subsidiaries or material damage to the
reputation of the Trust or any of its subsidiaries; (d) material breach of any one or more of the covenants contained in any proprietary
interest protection, confidentiality, non-competition or non-solicitation agreement between the participant and the Trust or a subsidiary;
or (e) violation of any statutory or common law duty of loyalty to the Trust or any of its subsidiaries. 

The
form of restricted share agreement for non-employee Trustees generally provides that unvested restricted shares will become immediately
vested in full if, prior to a vesting date, the participant dies or a change in control occurs while the participant is serving as a
Trustee. Any unvested restricted shares will be forfeited automatically if the participant ceases to serve as a Trustee prior to an applicable
vesting date. 

59 

Fiscal
Year 2023 Trustee Compensation 

We compensate our non-employee
Trustees for their services through grants of restricted Shares. The aggregate grant date fair value of these Shares is shown in the table
above. These restricted Shares vested in equal monthly amounts during our Fiscal Year 2023. As of January 31, 2023, Messrs. Kutasi, Chase
and Robson did not hold any unvested Shares. As compensation for our Fiscal Year 2023, on February 01, 2022, we issued 6,000 additional
restricted Shares (with the aggregate grant date fair value of 12,480 (per grant) to each of Messrs. Kutasi, Chase, and Robson. 

We do not pay our Trustees an annual cash retainer,
per meeting fees or additional compensation for serving on a Committee or as a Committee Chair. 

The
table below shows individual compensation information for our non-employee Trustees for our Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2023. Compensation
information for Messrs. Wirth and Berg and, who do not receive additional compensation for their service as Trustees, is included in

13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND TRUSTEE INDEPENDENCE 

Independence
of Trustees 

The
Board of Trustees has determined that a majority of the Trustees, Messrs. Kutasi, Chase and Robson are independent, as
defined by the NYSE AMERICAN s listing standards, for purposes of serving on the Board of Trustees and each committee of which
they are members. Messrs. Berg and Wirth are executive officers of the Trust and, therefore, are not independent. All members
of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Governance and Nominating Committee are independent, as such
term is defined by the SEC rules and NYSE AMERICAN s listing standards. Our independent Trustees meet at least annually in executive
session without the presence of non-independent Trustees and management. Except as described under Certain Transactions 
below, there were no transactions, relationships, or arrangements in Fiscal Year 2022 that required review by the Board for purposes
of determining Trustee independence. 

61 

Certain
Transactions 

Management
and Licensing Agreements 

The
Trust directly manages the Hotels through the Trust s wholly-owned subsidiary, RRF Limited Partnership (RRF). Under the management
agreements, RRF manages the daily operations of the Hotels. All Trust managed Hotel expenses, revenues and reimbursements among the Trust,
RRF, and the Partnership have been eliminated in consolidation. The management fees for the Hotels are 5 of room revenue and a monthly
accounting fee of 2,000 per hotel. These agreements have no expiration date and may be cancelled by either party with 90-days written
notice in the event the property changes ownership. 

The
Trust also provides the use of the InnSuites trademark to the Hotels through the Trust s wholly-owned subsidiary,
RRF Limited Partnership, at no additional charge. 

Restructuring
Agreements 

For
information about the restructuring agreements for Albuquerque Suite Hospitality, Tucson Hospitality Properties, see Notes 3 and
4 of our consolidated financial statements. 

Financing
Arrangements and Guarantees 

On
December 30, 2020, the Trust entered a 2,000,000 net maximum Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note with Rare Earth Financial.
The Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note bears interest at 7.0 per annum, is interest only quarterly and matures on June
30, 2022 and automatically renews annually unless either party gives a six-month written advance notice. No prepayment penalty exists
on the Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note. The balance fluctuates significantly through the period with the highest payable
balance being approximately 1,595,000 during the Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2023. The Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory
Note has a net maximum borrowing capacity of 2,000,000. Related party interest expense or income for the Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory
Note for the Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2023 was 17,000 of expense, and for the Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2022 was 71,000 of
expense. 

The
above Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Notes are presented together as one line item on the balance sheet and totaled a receivable
of 0 and 0, at January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, all of which is considered a current receivable. 

As
of January 31, 2023, the Trust had a 200,000 unsecured note payable with an individual lender. The promissory note is payable on demand,
or on June 30, 2024, whichever occurs first. The loan accrues interest at 4.5 and interest only payments shall be made monthly. The
Trust may pay all of part of this note without any repayment penalties. The total principal amount of this loan is 200,000 as of January
31, 2023. 

On
July 1, 2019, the Trust and the Partnership together entered into an unsecured loan totaling 270,000 with an individual investor at
4.5 , interest only, payable monthly. The loan has been subsequently extended to June 30, 2024. The Trust may pay all or part of this
note without any repayment penalties. The total principal amount of this loan is 270,000 as of January 31, 2023. 

On
July 1, 2019, the Trust and Partnership together entered into an unsecured loan, totaling 100,000 with an individual investor at 4.0 
interest only, payable monthly. The loan had been subsequently extended to December 31, 2022. The total principal amount of this loan
is 100,000 as of January 31, 2023. It is expected this loan will be repaid in full during the first Fiscal Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. 

62 

Other
Related Party Transactions 

The
Trust employs part time, an immediate family member of Mr. Wirth, Brian James Wirth, who provides IT Technology support services to the
Trust, receiving a 37,000 annual salary. 

Compensation
Information 

For
information regarding compensation of our executive officers, see Item 11 of this Form 10-K. 

Review,
Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Parties 

On
December 10, 2013, the Board of Trustees adopted a Related Party Transactions Policy, which established procedures for reviewing transactions
between us and our Trustees and executive officers, their immediate family members, entities with which they have a position or relationship,
and persons known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our Shares of Beneficial Interest. These procedures help us evaluate
whether any related person transaction could impair the independence of a Trustee or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a
Trustee or executive officer. First, the related party transaction is presented to our executive management, including our Chief Financial
Officer. Our Chief Financial Officer then discusses the transaction with our outside counsel, as needed. Lastly, the Audit Committee
and the members of the Board of Trustees who do not have an interest in the transaction review the transaction and, if they approve,
pass a resolution authorizing the transaction. In determining whether to approve a Related Party Transaction, the Audit Committee and
the members of the Board of Trustees consider whether the terms of the related party transaction are fair to the Trust on the same basis
as would apply if the transaction did not involve a related party; whether there are business reasons for the Trust to enter into the
related party transaction; whether the related party transaction would impair the independence of the outside Trustee and whether the
related party transaction would present an improper conflict of interest for any Trustee or executive officer of the Trust, taking into
account the size of the transaction, the overall financial position of the trustee, executive officer or related party, the direct or
indirect nature of the Trustee s, executive officer s or other related party interest in the transaction and the ongoing
nature of any proposed relationship, and any other factors the Audit Committee and members of the Board of Trustees deem relevant. Our
Related Party Transactions Policy is available in the Corporate Governance portion of our website at www.innsuitestrust.com.

14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES 

The
following table presents aggregate fees for the Fiscal Years ended January 31, 2023, and 2022, for professional services rendered by
BF Borgers CPA PC:

 Other Fees 
 -

 Total 
 141,955 
 160,000 

(1) 
 Audit
 Fees represent fees for professional services provided in connection with the audit of our annual financial statements, review
 of financial statements included in our quarterly reports and related services normally provided in connection with statutory and
 regulatory filings and engagements. 

(2) 
 Tax
 Fees represent fees for professional services provided in connection with the preparation of our annual Federal and State
 tax returns, additional tax related research and consulting, and related services normally provided in connection with statutory
 and regulatory filings, both at the Federal and State level. 

63 

The
Board of Trustees has considered whether the provision of non-audit services is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant s
independence. There were no fees billed by or paid to our independent registered public accounting firm during the Fiscal Years ended
January 31, 2023 and 2022 for tax compliance, tax advice or tax planning services or for financial information systems design and implementation
services. The Trust has decided to retain BF Borgers, to perform the tax return preparation, for tax years 2022 and 2023, for all entities
within the Trust. 

Policy
on Pre-Approval of Audit and Permitted Non-Audit Services 

The
Audit Committee pre-approves all fees for services performed by our independent auditors, currently BF Borgers, CPA PC. Unless a type
of service our independent auditors provided received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.
Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The term of any pre-approval
is 12 months from the date of pre-approval unless the Audit Committee specifically provides for a different period. Since May 6, 2003,
the effective date of the SEC s rules requiring Audit Committee pre-approval of audit and non-audit services performed by our independent
auditors, all of the services provided by our independent auditors were approved in accordance with these policies and procedures.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of InnSuites Hospitality Trust: 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of InnSuites Hospitality Trust (the Company as of January 31,
2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the two years in
the period ended January 31, 2023, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2023
and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two years in the period ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 

We
determined that there are no critical audit matters.
